In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: 2 Applicant is 31 years old. He has been employed as a network technician by a defense contractor since July 2005. He worked in the same location and under the same supervisor but for a different employer from March 2005 until July 2006. The Electronic 3 Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) Applicant submitted on March 11, 2008, lists periods of employment as either a network technician or network engineer with three different employers between October 2000 and April 2003. It also lists periods of unemployment from December 2001 until February 2002, and May 2003 until February 2005. There is no record evidence to explain why Applicant left his prior employments. Applicant was awarded a bachelor of arts degree in organizational communication in May 1999. He is single and he did not list any dependents in the e-QIP he submitted. The SOR lists 16 collection accounts owing in the total amount of $26,906. A review of the credit reports contained in the FORM discloses that most of the delinquent accounts arose from student loans, medical expenses, credit cards, cellular phone charges and cable television charges. These accounts have been delinquent for varying periods of time with some delinquencies dating as far back as 2002. Other than the periods of unemployment, the last ",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns that arise from his financial\nirresponsibility, as demonstrated by the many debts he has allowed to remain delinquent\nfor a number of years, and his failure to disclose those debts, as required, in a security\nclearance application he submitted in March 2008.  \nOn August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nDecember 30, 2008\n\n In addition to the SOR and Applicant\u2019s response, the attachments to the FORM consist only of\n2\ntransmittal documents, an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) and two credit\nreports.   \n This information is taken from the e-QIP in the FORM. There is no explanation for the discrepant\n3\ndates of employment. \n2\nGuideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted an undated answer to the SOR in\nwhich he admitted all allegations and requested a clearance decision based on the written\nrecord without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September\n29, 2008, that was mailed to Applicant the same day. Applicant was notified he had 30\ndays from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections thereto or any additional\ninformation he wanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on\nOctober 9, 2008. He did not respond to the FORM, object to anything contained in the\nFORM, or submit any additional information he wanted considered within the time provided\nto him. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits,  I make the following findings of fact:\n2\nApplicant is 31 years old. He has been employed as a network technician by a\ndefense contractor since July 2005. He worked in the same location and under the same\nsupervisor but for a different employer from March 2005 until July 2006.  The Electronic\n3\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) Applicant submitted on March 11,\n2008, lists periods of employment as either a network technician or network engineer with\nthree different employers between October 2000 and April 2003. It also lists periods of\nunemployment from December 2001 until February 2002, and May 2003 until February\n2005. There is no record evidence to explain why Applicant left his prior employments. \nApplicant was awarded a bachelor of arts degree in organizational communication\nin May 1999. He is single and he did not list any dependents in the e-QIP he submitted.\nThe SOR lists 16 collection accounts owing in the total amount of $26,906. A review\nof the credit reports contained in the FORM discloses that most of the delinquent accounts\narose from student loans, medical expenses, credit cards, cellular phone charges and\ncable television charges. These accounts have been delinquent for varying periods of time\nwith some delinquencies dating as far back as 2002. Other than the periods of\nunemployment, the last of which ended in February 2005, there is no record evidence to\nexplain why the accounts became delinquent. Further, there is no record evidence that\nApplicant has made any effort to satisfy any of the accounts since he resumed employment\nin March 2005. \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR that he deliberately falsified the e-\nQIP he submitted in March 2008 by failing to disclose his many delinquent accounts in\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n7\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n3\nresponse to questions asking if he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt or\nif he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the preceding seven years.  There\nis no record evidence to explain or mitigate the falsification. \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct), with their respective DC and MC, are\nmost relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,\n6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id, at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n4\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n12\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has 16 accounts, totalling almost $27,000, that have been submitted for\ncollection. There is no record evidence to indicate he has taken any steps to resolve any\nof the delinquent accounts. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts; DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. \nApplicant failed to provide any explanation why the accounts became delinquent.\nThe e-QIP he submitted lists two periods of unemployment and the credit reports in the\nFORM disclose that a number of the delinquent accounts are related to medical expenses.\nHowever, Applicant failed to provide any information as to what, if any, impact those factors\nhad on his ability to satisfy his creditors or remain current on his debts. Likewise, he did not\nprovide any information on what actions he may or may not have taken as a result of his\nunemployment or medical issues to minimize the impact those episodes had on his ability\nto remain financially secure. Most importantly, Applicant failed to provide any evidence or\nexplanation why he has not made any effort to resolve any of the accounts since he\nresumed employment almost four years ago.  \nI have considered Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances and conclude it does not\napply because of Applicant\u2019s failure to provide evidence that he acted responsibly while\neither unemployed or ill. The record is devoid of any evidence on which to base application\nof any other mitigating condition. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n5\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant failed to disclose his many delinquent accounts in the e-QIP he submitted\nin March 2008 in response to questions asking if he had accounts that were more than 90\nand 180 days past due. He admitted in his SOR response that he deliberately falsified the\ne-QIP. He failed to provide any explanation or other mitigating evidence that in anyway\nwould mitigate the falsification. DC 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities applies. Again, the record is devoid of any evidence on which to\nbase application of any mitigating condition.   \n \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions.\nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, including the very limited facts of record about Applicant, the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by the\nfinancial considerations that are present in this case and his personal conduct. He has not\novercome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-p:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                            \nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n\n7\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 31-year-old acquisition management analyst working for a defense contractor. He graduated from high school in 1995, and joined the U.S. Navy in October 1998. He served honorably on active duty for eight years and was discharged in December 2006. He achieved the grade of E-5, and his service was characterized as honorable. Appellant took some college courses while in the Navy. He plans to enroll full time in college during the summer of 2009. Applicant married his first wife in August 1999, they were legally separated in April 2006, and their divorce became final in June 2008 (Tr. 27). The court did not adjudicate the marital property because Applicant\u2019s ex-wife cannot be found. Applicant has two children of this marriage, ages nine and six. Applicant was forced to leave his Navy career to take care of his children after he received full custody of his children during his 2006 separation proceedings. 1 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Dir",

I believe Applicant has learned \nfrom his past mistakes and, in the future, will be able to live within his financial means. \nHe mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 4, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On December 18, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJune 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn January 14, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 26, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 11, 2009. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on March 26, 2009. The government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 15). Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 9, which \nwere admitted without objection (Tr. 19).2 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on April 3, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. He denied \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, because he is disputing the debt. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old acquisition management analyst working for a defense \ncontractor. He graduated from high school in 1995, and joined the U.S. Navy in October \n1998. He served honorably on active duty for eight years and was discharged in \nDecember 2006. He achieved the grade of E-5, and his service was characterized as \nhonorable. Appellant took some college courses while in the Navy. He plans to enroll \nfull time in college during the summer of 2009. \n \nApplicant married his first wife in August 1999, they were legally separated in \nApril 2006, and their divorce became final in June 2008 (Tr. 27). The court did not \nadjudicate the marital property because Applicant\u2019s ex-wife cannot be found. Applicant \nhas two children of this marriage, ages nine and six. Applicant was forced to leave his \nNavy career to take care of his children after he received full custody of his children \nduring his 2006 separation proceedings.  \n \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n2  AE 9 was submitted post-hearing. I left the record open to allow Applicant additional time to \nsubmit matters on his behalf. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant was unemployed for approximately three \nmonths (e-QIP). Between February 2007 and October 2007, he worked three different \nlow paying jobs, twice as a pest control technician and then as a service technician. He \nwas hired by his current employer, a large defense contractor, in October 2007. \n \nApplicant married his second wife in June 2008. He has one stepchild and one \nnew son of this marriage. His current wife worked and contributed to the household \nfinances until she had to go on maternity leave to have their child. While on maternity \nleave she was laid off. She is currently not working but collects around $1,200 from \nunemployment. She also receives $650 in monthly financial support from the father of \nher child. She uses part of her money to contribute to the household finances.  \n \nIn his February 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he filed \nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2002, had a car repossessed in 2006, and had \nother financial problems. His background investigation addressed his financial status \nand included the review of February and December 2008 credit bureau reports (CBRs), \nApplicant\u2019s answers to August 2008 DOHA interrogatory, and his answer to the SOR.  \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and was \ndischarged of all debts in October 2002. Subsequent to his bankruptcy discharge, he \nacquired three new debts which became delinquent totaling approximately $31,085. \nConcerning the bankruptcy, Applicant explained that in 2000, he bought a new Chevy \nTracker (Tr. 45-46). The car caught fire due to an electrical short and was totaled. His \ninsurance company paid the blue book value for the vehicle, but that was not enough to \ncover his total financial obligation. He still had a balance of around $20,000. He was a \nsailor (E-2) in the Navy and could not afford to pay this debt and his family\u2019s day-to-day \nliving expenses, thus he filed for bankruptcy protection (Tr. 24). \n \nConcerning the other three SOR allegations and his financial problems, Applicant \nexplained most of his delinquent debts were the result of his acrimonious divorce and \nhis ex-wife acquiring numerous loans and debts without his knowledge.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (MILITLNS/OMNI - $1,703) concerns a loan made by his ex-wife while \nmarried to Applicant, but without his consent. Applicant contacted the creditor and \nsettled this loan in December 2007. After the settlement, he made monthly payments of \n$150 and finished paying off this debt in December 2008 (AE 1 & 9).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (Navy Federal Credit Union debt for $28,533) \u2013 this is a loan Applicant \nand his ex-wife made in 2004 for the purchase of a used 2000 Lincoln Navigator (Tr. 31-\n32). In April 2006, during the marital separation asset division hearing, Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife took possession of the Navigator and a Dodge Neon he and she had purchased for \nher use. Applicant did not contest her request for the Navigator because he was \nscheduled to deploy and he did not want the Neon. \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife could not afford the Navigator and voluntarily turned it over to \nthe creditor. Applicant was deployed and was not made aware that the Navigator had \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbeen repossessed. He disputed the debt with the creditor because his ex-wife \nrequested and was given the car during the 2006 property settlement hearing. However, \nneither marital property nor responsibility for the debts has been allocated by the \ndivorce court because Applicant\u2019s ex-wife cannot be found. This debt is still outstanding \nand Applicant is responsible for it. He has not been making any payments. He intends \nto file for bankruptcy protection to resolve this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (Rash/Curtis Associates - $849) this concerns a bill for medical \nservices received by his ex-wife in July 2007. She illegally used her military dependent \nidentification card to receive medical services after Applicant had left the Navy \n(December 2006), and after they were legally separated (Tr. 21). Applicant contacted \nthe creditor and disputed the debt. The creditor agreed to release him from liability (Tr. \n22). He is waiting for the release of liability document. \n \nApplicant explained his financial problems were mostly the result of his \nacrimonious divorce, his ex-wife\u2019s acquiring loans and debts without his knowledge, and \nhim losing his military career to take care of his children. He was granted custody of his \nchildren during the legal separation proceedings. His ex-wife was required to provide \nfinancial support. However, she disappeared and has provided no financial support to \nthe children.  \n \nCurrently, Applicant is remarried and has a stable home and lifestyle. Since \nOctober 2007 he has had stable employment and he and his wife have established a \ncombined household budget. He has resolved all his delinquent loans, except for the \nloan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. In May/June 2008, and in January 2009, Applicant consulted \nwith his attorney about filing for bankruptcy protection. He believes he cannot afford to \npay for the Navigator debt and his family\u2019s day-to-day living expenses (Tr. 25). He has \nto wait until sometime in 2009 to be able to file for bankruptcy protection. \n \nApplicant received pre-deployment financial counseling while in the Navy in 2005 \n(Tr. 40, 47). Since then, he has discussed his financial situation with his attorney, but he \nhas not participated in any additional financial counseling (Tr. 48). \n \nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is approximately $2,600 (Tr. 34). His new \nwife contributes to the household finances and pays some of the family\u2019s financial \nexpenses with her unemployment check and the financial support she receives from her \nchild\u2019s father. His current expenses include: $500 in rent; $400 for utilities; $50 for \ncable; $450 for his wife\u2019s car payment; $200 gas; $300 for food; and $150 in \nmiscellaneous expenses. Applicant drives an F-150 his mother bought for him, and he \ndoes not pay insurance because he is included in his mother\u2019s insurance policy (Tr. 35). \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He was candid and \nforthcoming explaining the circumstances surrounding his financial problems. I believe \nhe has learned his lesson. He is now well aware of what is required of him to show that \nhe is reliable, trustworthy, and financially responsible. He is very concerned about the \nadverse impact losing his security clearance will have on his family and his career.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant noted his eight year service to his country while in the Navy and that he \nhas performed well for his current employer. His Navy evaluation reports show he was \nconsidered an outstanding sailor with excellent potential for future service. He was \nstrongly recommended for early promotion (AEs 3 & 4). His current employer\u2019s \nperformance evaluations show he meets or exceeds his performance requirements \n(AEs 6 & 8). He is regarded as a good employee. There is no evidence that during his \nyears of naval service Applicant ever compromised or caused others to compromise \nclassified information. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002 and was discharged of all of his \nfinancial obligations. Subsequent to his discharge, Applicant acquired three debts that \nwere delinquent for a number of years. Of the three delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR, Applicant paid SOR \u00b6 1.a ($1,703); he is properly disputing SOR \u00b6 1.c ($849); \nand SOR \u00b6 1.b ($28,533) is still delinquent and outstanding. Applicant did not have the \nfinancial means to pay his legal obligations, delinquent debts, and his day-to-day living \nexpenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies, but only in part because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nongoing. However, the evidence shows his financial problems occurred under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that established circumstances beyond his control \ncontributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his discharge from the service to take \ncare of his children; he was unemployed for three months after his discharge and \nunderemployed for approximately one year; his ex-wife acquired loans and debts \nwithout his consent; and he had financial expenses related to his separation and divorce \nfrom his first wife. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially, and does not fully mitigate the \nfinancial concerns.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to show he acted financially responsibly in light of his income, \nfinancial stability, and overall financial practices. He presented some evidence of efforts \nto contact creditors or to resolve his debts by entering into a settlement agreement and \npayment \nplan \nstarting \nin \n2007, \nafter \nhe \nbecame \npermanently \nemployed. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s financial problems seem to be caused, in part, by him living \nbeyond his means, i.e., buying expensive cars that he cannot afford. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Applicant is resolving his financial problems, but \nhis financial problems are not yet under control. Considering the record as a whole, \nApplicant should have been more diligent resolving his financial problems. He did show, \nhowever, that he made good-faith efforts to resolve his debts, and that his financial \nproblems are being resolved.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies.  Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. The remaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the facts \nin this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well trained \nman, and a good father. He served honorably for eight years in the Navy and has been \nsuccessful working for a defense contractor since October 2007. Applicant established \ncircumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his \ndischarge from the service; his period of unemployment and underemployment; his ex-\nwife over spending; and his separation and divorce. \n \nThere is no evidence he has ever compromised classified information or \ncommitted any security violations. He has established a reputation as a valuable, \ndedicated and reliable employee. Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his financial \nmistakes and seems resolute in fixing his current financial problems. These factors \nshow responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant acted somewhat irresponsibly when he purchased \nseveral cars outside of his financial means, causing him to become financially \noverextended. He still has a $28,533 delinquent debt for a car he acquired, likely \nbeyond his financial means.  \n \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s eight year naval \n\n \n9 \n \n \nservice, his two year performance for a government contractor, and his efforts to resolve \nhis financial problems before receipt of the SOR show some reliability, judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. He is now in a stable relationship and \nhas a stable job. I believe Applicant has learned from his past mistakes and, in the \nfuture, will be able to live within his financial means. Overall, the record evidence \nconvinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 17, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 16, 2009 after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found, inter alia, that Applicant was convicted of drug related crimes in 1968.  In\n1979 he was convicted of felony burglary and receiving stolen property.  In 1989 he was convicted\nin federal court of \u201cpossession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute\u201d and \u201cuse of a\nfirearm in relation to drug trafficking.\u201d  He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and served\neight years after which he was on supervised probation for 4-5 more years.  Applicant prepared\npublic trust and security clearance applications in 2000, 2004, and 2007.  Each time he deliberately\nfailed to disclosure pertinent information regarding his drug and criminal history. \nApplicant does not deny his past criminal history, nor does he deny the fact that he\ndeliberately falsified answers to questions about his criminal history on public trust position and\nsecurity clearance applications.  He asserts, however, that he has paid dearly for his past offenses,\nis now rehabilitated, and leads an honorable life.  Applicant feels that the genuine remorse that he\nnow feels, the many difficulties in life that he has experienced, and the success that he has recently\nachieved mitigate the security concerns raised by his past misconduct.   These assertions do not\nestablish error on the part of the Judge.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains a lengthy discussion of his life, the problems he has\nexperienced, and his thoughts about those problems.  Some of the matters discussed by Applicant\nare not included in the record below.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive,\n\u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She applied applicable mitigating conditions and found in Applicant\u2019s favor\nregarding significant criminal activity he had engaged in prior to 1990.  However, the Judge\nconcluded that there was insufficient evidence to mitigate the more recent and repeated instances of\nfalsification of public trust position and security clearance applications.  These conclusions are\nreasonably supported by the record.  The Judge also considered Applicant\u2019s overcoming of his earlier\ndifficulties and his recent career successes in her whole person analysis.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

He executed a security clearance application (SF-86) on \nDecember 2, 2004, and he executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation \nProcessing (e-QIP) on June 12, 2007. On November 17, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nMarch 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 1, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 5, 2009. I convened a hearing on February 6, 2009, to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified \non his own behalf. He called no witnesses and offered eight exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. A through H and admitted to the record without objection. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on February 17, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal \nConduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.) and seven allegations of disqualifying conduct \nunder AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.g.). In his Answer to the SOR,   \nApplicant admitted all Guideline J and Guideline E allegations and provided additional \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. (Answer to \nSOR; Tr. 21, 35; Ex. D.)  \n \n \nApplicant, who is 58 years old and employed as a senior developer analyst by a \nfederal contractor, seeks a security clearance. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree, \nawarded to him in 1978. He also attended graduate school for one year in the 1980s, \nbut did not earn an advanced degree.  In his youth, he married and divorced. He \nmarried a second time in 2001. He and his wife are foster parents for three special \nneeds children. His professional specialty is computer science. He reports an annual \nincome of over $100,000.  (Ex. G; Ex. H; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Tr. 18, 51-53, 65, 79.) \n \n \n In 1968, when he was 18 years old, Applicant left home to attend college in \nanother state. At college he encountered the \u201chippie\u201d lifestyle and its drug culture. He \nbegan using illegal drugs, including LSD. He was arrested in 1969 and charged with (1) \nUnlawful Possession of Drugs for Sale, (2) Transportation/Sale/Manufacture of Drugs \nWithout Prescription, and (3) Sale of Narcotics. At the time of his arrest, Applicant was \nunder the influence of LSD and in possession of about 20 tabs of LSD, which he \nplanned to sell to others. He pled guilty to the charges.  (Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Answer to SOR; \nTr. 76-78.) \n \n \nAs a result of his LSD use, he was committed to a state hospital for 30 days for \nobservation.  During this period, he violated hospital policy by leaving the hospital.  He \nwas subsequently committed to a second hospital for about eleven months.  Thereafter, \nhe was placed on six years of supervised probation. From June 1970 to June 1972, he \nreturned to college and served two years of the supervised probation. (Ex. 4; Answer to \nSOR. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn 1975, Applicant went with a friend to consult with a divorce attorney. Applicant \nconcluded the attorney was arrogant and he was angered by the way the divorce \nattorney spoke to his friend. Three weeks later, in what he defined as retaliation, \nApplicant returned to the attorney\u2019s office, broke in, and stole a lamp and some pieces \nof furniture.  Applicant was arrested and charged with two counts of Felony Burglary \nand two counts of Receiving Stolen Property. He pled guilty to the charges and was \nsentenced to six months in jail.  (Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Tr. 79-81.) \n \n \nFourteen years later, in 1989, Applicant was working as a route driver for a soft \ndrink company. Some of the truck drivers made and used methamphetamine to stay \nawake while they drove. They gave the methamphetamine to Applicant, who became \ndependent on the drug. He began to use and sell methamphetamine to others.  In \nOctober 1989, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Possession of Controlled \nSubstances With Intent to Distribute and (2) Use of a Firearm in Relation to Drug \nTrafficking. Applicant pled guilty to the charges in federal court and was sentenced to 10 \nyears in federal prison (five years on each count).  He served about eight years of the \nsentence in federal prisons and was paroled in April 1998. From about April 1998 to \nApril of 2002 or 2003, he was on supervised probation. Since his release from prison in \n1998, he has not been arrested or charged with any criminal behavior, and he has not \nused alcohol or illegal drugs. (Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Tr. 59, 82-86. 88.) \n \n \nWhen he was in prison, Applicant met a man who mentored him and helped him \nto acquire training in computer technology.  When he was released from prison, \nApplicant returned to school and studied diligently to acquire new technical skills and \nabilities. In 2002, his employer honored him as Employee of the Year. (Ex. A; Ex. G; Tr. \n15-16.) \n \n   \n \n \nIn September 2000, Applicant executed a Questionnaire for Public Trust \nPositions (SF-85P).  Question 11 on the SF-85P directed the respondent to reply as \nfollows: \n \nList your employment activities, beginning with the present (#1) and \nworking back 7 years. You should list all full-time work, part-time work, \nmilitary service, temporary military duty stations over 90 days, self \nemployment, other paid work, and all periods of unemployment.  The \nentire 7-year period must be accounted for without breaks, but you need \nnot list employment before your 16th birthday.   \n \n \nIn response to Question 11, Applicant stated that he was employed as a driver \nfor a soft-drink company between July 1992 to October 1997, when, in fact, he was \nincarcerated in federal prison during that time.  (Answer to Statement of Reasons; Ex. 1; \nEx. 4; Tr. 61-62.) \n \n \nIn December 2004, Applicant executed an SF-86.  Question 21 on the SF-86 \nreads as follows:  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n21. Your Police Record \u2013 Felony Offenses. Have you ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any felony offense?  (Include those under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice.) For this item, report information \nregardless of whether the record in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or \notherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception to this \nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C.3607. \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 21.  He deliberately did not list his felony \noffenses in 1969, 1975, and 1989. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 2; Ex. 4; Tr. 61-62.)    \n \n \nWhen Applicant executed his SF-86 in December 2004, he was asked the \nfollowing question: \n \n22. Your Police Record \u2013 Firearms/Explosive Offenses. Have you ever \nbeen charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives offense?  For \nthis item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case \nhas been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the court record.  The single \nexception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal \nControlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement \norder under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. \n \n \nIn response to Question 22, Applicant answered \u201cno.  He deliberately failed to \nreport his 1989 arrest and conviction for Use of a Firearm in relation to Drug Trafficking.  \n(Answer to SOR; Ex.2; Ex. 4; Tr. 61-62.) \n \n \nApplicant was also asked the following question when he executed his SF-86 in \nDecember 2004: \n \n24. Your Police Record \u2013 Alcohol/Drug Offenses. Have you even been \ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?  \nFor this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your \ncase has been \u201csealed\u201d or   otherwise stricken from the court record.  The \nsingle exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the \nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an \nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. \n3607. \n \n \nIn response to Question 24, Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d  He deliberately failed to \ndisclose his arrests and convictions for drug-related offenses in 1969 and 1989, as \nspecified supra. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 2; Ex. 4; Tr. 61-62.) \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant executed an e-QIP. Section 23 of the e-QIP asks about \nan Applicant\u2019s police record.  Section 23a asks: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any felony offense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military \n\n \n5 \n \n \nJustice.)\u201d Section 23b asks: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of a \nfirearms or explosives offense?\u201d  Section 23d asks: \u201cHave you ever been charged with \nor convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d  An individual responding to \nthese questions is advised to \u201creport information regardless of whether the record in \nyour case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception \nto this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances \nAct for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. \n844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions posed in Sections 23a, 23b, and 23d of \nthe e-QIP.  In doing so, he deliberately failed to disclose his arrests and convictions for \nthe \nfelony \ncrimes \nof \nUnlawful \nPossession \nof \nDrugs \nfor \nSale, \nTransportation/Sale/Manufacture of Drugs Without Prescription, Sale of Narcotics, \nFelony  Burglary, Receiving Stolen Property, Possession of Controlled Substances With \nIntent to Distribute, and Use of a Firearm in relation to Drug Trafficking.  Additionally, he \nalso deliberately failed to disclose being charged and convicted of a firearms offense \nand his drug offenses in 1969 and 1989, as specified supra.  (Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Tr. 61-\n62.) \n \n \nAfter executing the SF-85P in 2000, the SF-86 in 2004, and the e-QIP in 2007,  \nApplicant signed certifications which read as follows: \u201cMy statements on this form, and \nany attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and \nbelief and are made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful false \nstatement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section \n1001 of title 18, United States Code.)\u201d (Ex. 1; Ex. 2; Ex. 3) \n \n \nApplicant admitted his falsifications. He explained his motivation for his \nintentional falsifications as follows:  \n \nI omitted these offenses from three clearance applications. The first I \nthought got by, so much time had passed.  I knew I was wrong.  Okay?  \nSo I replicated the info from one to another.  I omitted it because I felt the \ngovernment would not approve me, especially without an accomplished \nresume showing reform.  (Tr. 14.) \n \nI made a conscious decision [to omit information about past criminal \nbehavior from his security clearance applications] thinking---feeling that I \nwould not have the opportunity to get out of the hole I was in unless I \nestablished some sort of resume. (Tr. 62.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current and past supervisors and co-workers regard him with \nadmiration and respect. They consider him to be professional, highly productive, a \u201cself \nstarter,\u201d responsible, and reliable.  (Ex. B; Ex. C; Ex. D; Ex. E; Ex. F.) \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n \n \nApplicant admits a criminal history that spans 20 years. In 1969, he was charged \nand convicted of drug-related offenses. In 1975, he was charged and convicted of two \ncounts of Felony Burglary and two counts of Receiving Stolen Property. In 1989, he was \ncharged and convicted of Possession of Controlled Substances With Intent to Distribute \nand Use of a Firearm in relation to Drug Trafficking, crimes for which he was sentenced \nto federal prison for ten years. He has not been arrested for any criminal behavior since \nhis release from prison in 1998.  \n \n \n \nIn addition to his criminal history, Applicant admits deliberately falsifying three \nsecurity clearance applications by concealing his criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s criminal \nhistory and his deliberate falsification of that history on his security clearance \napplications raise concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) and AG \u00b6 31(c).1 \n \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \n \nThe record demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior between 1969 and \n1989 was serious and substantial. He has not been arrested or charged with criminal \nbehavior since his release from federal prison in 1998. During his incarceration, he met \na mentor who helped him develop skills and abilities he could use to earn a living after \nhe was released from prison. After his release from prison, he married and began to \nbuild his life. He and his wife are reaching out as foster parents to special needs \nchildren.  Applicant\u2019s supervisors and colleagues praise his personal attributes and his \nprofessional skills. He demonstrates a good employment record and constructive \ninvolvement in his community. \n \n \n1 AG \u00b6 31(a) reads as follows: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \n\u201dallegation or admission or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nHowever, in 2000, 2004, and 2007, Applicant deliberately falsified three security \nclearance applications by concealing and failing to report his past criminal behavior.  His \nunwillingness or inability to inform the government about his past criminal behavior \nraises concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Additionally, \nhis deliberate falsifications suggest a failure in rehabilitation. I conclude that while AG \u00b6 \n32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply in part to mitigate Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct between \n1969 and 1989, they do not apply to his more recent criminal conduct involving the \ndeliberate falsification of his 2000, 2004, and 2007 security clearance applications. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and certified his security clearance applications in \n2000, 2004, and 2007, he deliberately failed to report his past criminal behavior \ninvolving illegal drug use, possession, and intent to distribute, felony burglary and \nreceiving stolen property, and use of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he admitted that his failure to disclose this information was \ndeliberate falsification of material facts. At his hearing, he stated that he feared the   \ngovernment would not grant him a security clearance if it learned of his past criminal \nbehavior. He further stated that this fear motivated him to conceal the truth from the \ngovernment. \n \n \nThe allegations in the SOR raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), which \nreads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \n \n \nSeveral Guideline mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a) if \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d If \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, \nomission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security process\u201d and \u201c[u]pon being made aware of \nthe requirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated fully and \ncompletely,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \n\n \n9 \n \n \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) might apply if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e) might apply if \n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d   \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on three security clearance \napplications that he executed and certified as true in 2000, 2004, and 2007. Nothing in \nthe record suggests that he took prompt good faith action to correct the omissions, \nconcealments or falsifications before he was confronted with the facts. To the contrary, \nhe deliberately continued to assert the falsifications for seven years. (AG \u00b6 17(a).) \nNothing in the record suggests that his failure to report his criminal behavior was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice specifically \nabout the security clearance process from authorized individuals or legal counsel. (AG \u00b6 \n17(b).) When he executed his security clearance applications, Applicant knew he had a \n20-year record of criminal behavior. As a mature adult, he knew that his criminal \nbehavior was not minor, so remote in time, so infrequent, or had occurred under such \nunique circumstances that it would not seriously impact his eligibility for a security \nclearance. (AG 17(c).) Applicant failed to provide documentation that he obtained \ncounseling or had taken other positive steps that might alleviate the circumstances that \ncaused his unreliable conduct and, as a result, such behavior was unlikely to recur. (AG \n\u00b6 17(d).) Nothing in the record suggests that Applicant took positive steps to reduce or \neliminate the vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress that his behavior \ncaused. (AG \u00b6 17(e).) I conclude, therefore, that none of the applicable personal \nconduct mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult who has \nbeen recognized by his supervisors and co-workers as sensible, responsible, and \ntrustworthy. After his release from prison, he worked diligently to acquire relevant \noccupational skills. He married and became a foster father to special needs children.  \nThese actions suggested successful rehabilitation. \n \nHowever, over a period of seven years, from 2000 to 2007, he completed three \nsecurity clearance applications and deliberately failed to report his past criminal \nbehavior, thereby creating a situation that could seriously mislead the government about \nhis honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness. His falsifications were not minor: they went \nto the heart of his capacity for truthfulness, a critical qualification for one who would hold \na security clearance. Applicant\u2019s failure to be truthful was deliberate. He made no effort \nto correct his falsifications before the government confronted him with his lack of \ncandor. His deliberate falsifications are recent. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \ncriminal conduct and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:             \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR\n1\nalleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E\n(personal conduct). On May 28, 2009, Applicant submitted her response to the SOR. She\nadmitted all SOR allegations except those contained in subparagraphs 1.f and 2.a. and she\nrequested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 1, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 15, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 18, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nSeptember 29, 2009\n\n2\nscheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted nine documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits\n(AE) 1-9. Department Counsel\u2019s objection to AE 1 was sustained. AE 2-9 were admitted\ninto the record without objection. The transcript was received on August 26, 2009.      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old woman who has been employed as a personal care\nadvocate by a defense contractor since October 2007. In the SF 85P she submitted on\nFebruary 2, 2008, she listed the following employment history: August 2007 to October\n2007: temporary agency; March 2007 to July 2007: unemployment; December 2006 to\nMarch 2007: unspecified employment; October to December 2006: customer service\nrepresentative; May 2003 to August 2006: customer service representative; April 2002 to\nMay 2003: receptionist; January 1999 to March 2002: receptionist; and August 1998 to\nDecember 1999: receptionist through a temporary agency. She testified she is currently\nworking part-time as a home health aide in addition to her full-time employment with the\ndefense contractor (Tr. 39). Applicant submitted a number of certificates and other awards\nthat indicate she has been commended for her work performance on a number of\noccasions. \nApplicant graduated from a vocational high school in June 1981, having completed\na course in cosmetology. She has been married since October 1988, although she and her\nhusband have frequently lived separate and apart, especially during the first ten years of\ntheir marriage. Their most recent separation occurred in or about 2005/06. They are now\nliving together. They have two children, ages 25 and 19. Both children attend college. The\nyoungest child resides with Applicant and her husband.\nApplicant testified she has suffered from bipolar disorder since 1984 (Tr. 47-48).\nShe also testified she was not properly medicated for the disorder from 1984 to 2006, and,\nas a result, she made some unwise choices that contributed to her financial problems (Tr.\n47-48).  \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy protection in April 1999. She testified she and her\nhusband initially filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection but because of poor decisions\nthey had to convert it into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Tr. 59). They were awarded a Chapter\n7 discharge in July 1999. Applicant was unable to recall how much debt was discharged\nin the bankruptcy, However, before they filed for bankruptcy, she knows they had two\nautomobiles repossessed. \nThe debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.c, 1.i, and 1.l are charge off and\ncollection accounts that resulted from deficiencies owing after the resale of additional\nautomobiles repossessed after Applicant was awarded the bankruptcy discharge in 1999.\nApplicant credibly testified she has only had four vehicles repossessed, two before and two\n\n It is impossible to discern from the record evidence whether the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i or\n2\n1.l is a duplicate of the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c. Accordingly, the larger of the two debts, alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.i, will be found for Applicant.  \n3\nafter she filed for bankruptcy (Tr. 69-71).  The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.g, owing in\n2\nthe amount of $3,254, is also alleged as having arisen from an automobile repossession.\nApplicant credibly testified that debt actually resulted from her daughter totaling an\nautomobile Applicant purchased in April 2008, and not from a fifth repossession (Tr. 75-\n76).\nSOR subparagraph 1.h alleges a collection account owing in the amount of $7,412.\nSOR subparagraph 1.j alleges a charge off account owing in the amount of $1,968. Each\nof these accounts has now resulted in judgments being entered against Applicant. The\ncreditor on the account alleged in subparagraph 1.j attached approximately $1,015 that\nApplicant had in a bank account leaving about $800 still owing on the judgment. The\ncreditor alleged in subparagraph 1.h has not begun collection action on its judgment.    \nApplicant testified the debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f arose from a former\nlandlord\u2019s claim for cleaning charges after she vacated an apartment. She denies she owes\nanything for cleaning the apartment because she properly cleaned it herself before she\nmoved. \nThe remaining delinquent debts alleged in the SOR consist of eight accounts that\nhave been submitted for collection, owing in the combined amount of $2,695, and one\naccount that has been charged off in the amount of $448. Applicant admits she is\nresponsible for these accounts and that no payment has been made on any of them.\nIn addition to the bad decisions she claims to have made as a result of her bipolar\ndisorder, Applicant attributes her financial problems to marital separations, various periods\nof unemployment she and her husband have experienced, reduced wages they have\nearned after changing jobs due to layoffs, and medical assistance she had to provide to\nher mother that caused her to take unpaid leave from work. She sought the assistance of\na debt service that did nothing other than submit disputes to credit reporting agencies in\nan effort to get older accounts deleted from her credit reports.\nApplicant does not having any funds in bank or retirement accounts. She has no\nmeans to satisfy any of her delinquent accounts. She is contemplating once again seeking\nbankruptcy protection. Meanwhile, she recently purchased a new automobile at a cost of\nabout $22,000. Her and her husband\u2019s combined monthly automobile payments are about\n$825. They also pay $317 per month for auto insurance. She testified she had to purchase\na new car instead of a used car because she did not have any cash available to pay for a\nused car (Tr. 82).   \nApplicant failed to disclose that she had debts that were over 180 days delinquent\nin the SF 85P she submitted on February 2, 2008. She testified she filled the SF 85P out\nbetween answering calls at work and didn\u2019t realize she had answered the question\nincorrectly (Tr. 91-92) However, in the SF 85P, Applicant listed a detailed work history,\n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n3\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n4\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n5\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n6\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n4\naddresses and phone numbers for residence and work references dating back as far as\n1998, and her reported last use of marijuana in 2007. \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n3\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.4\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n5\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.6\nAn administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The administrative judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.7\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n8\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n9\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection but had to have it converted to\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 1999. She was awarded a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge\nin July 1999. She had two cars repossessed before she filed for bankruptcy and she had\ntwo more cars repossessed since receiving the bankruptcy discharge. She has two\ndelinquent accounts that have recently resulted in judgments being entered against her.\nThe creditor on one of those judgments seized all the funds Applicant had in her bank\naccount to partially satisfy the judgment. The other judgment creditor has not begun\ncollection proceedings. Finally, Applicant has nine additional delinquent accounts, owing\nin the combined amount of $3,143, that have either been submitted for collection or\ncharged off. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\nand DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant attributes her financial problems to periods of unemployment, decreased\nincome due to the change of jobs caused by layoffs, her bipolar disorder, marital\nseparations, and her need to take unpaid leave from work to care for her mother. However,\nit cannot be said that she acted responsibly under the circumstances, as best evidenced\nby the repeated repossession of automobiles and Applicant\u2019s recent purchase of yet\nanother automobile that she obviously is not going to be able to afford and somehow make\nan attempt to satisfy her delinquent creditors. Accordingly, Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b):\nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances does not apply.\nThe remaining mitigating conditions have no applicability to the facts of this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. (Adjudicative Guideline\n[AG] 15)\nApplicant failed to disclose her many delinquent debts in the SF 85P she submitted\nin February 2008. Her explanation that the omission was inadvertent because she filled out\nthe SF 85P between telephone calls while working is not credible considering the detailed\ninformation she provided in that SF 85P about her employment history, residential and job\nreferences, and her last reported use of marijuana. DC 16(a): deliberate omission,\n\n6\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personal security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, of similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility\nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies. No mitigating condition\napplies.\n \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of her acts\nand omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration\nall relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. She has not overcome\nthe case against her or satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g-h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j-q:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Applicant has been married for over 37 years and has two daughters who have disabilities. One daughter is still at home being cared for by his wife.

On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns for financial considerations under Guideline F.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 13, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 29, 2009.  He denied the three \nallegations under Guideline F, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 20, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on May 4, 2009.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 20, 2009, \nfor a hearing on June 9, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government \noffered four exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov.

Based on a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information \nis granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on May 28, 2009.  Applicant is entitled \nto 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8).  Applicant discussed with Department \nCounsel the hearing date of June 9, 2009, prior to the Notice of Hearing being mailed so \nactual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing.  However, Applicant \nsigned for the Notice of Hearing only 13 days prior to the hearing.  If there was an issue \non notice, Applicant waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 5). \n \n \nApplicant in his post-hearing submissions provided a reference to his home \nstate's Civil Remedies and Procedures Statute of Limitation (App. Ex. N, State Statute, \nTitle 15, Chapter 3, Article 1).  Applicant contends that collection of his outstanding \ndelinquent debts is barred by this statute of limitation.  Department Counsel objected to \nconsideration of the statute because a state's statute of limitations has only limited \napplication in security clearance cases.  Department Counsel's objection is overruled \nand the statute of limitation is admitted for the limited purpose of determining how the \nstatute affects the facts and circumstances of Applicant's debt payments as well as his \ntrustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor.  He served \n20 years on active duty with the Air Force retiring in 1991 as a staff sergeant (E-6).  He \nheld a security clearance for over 18 year of his time on active duty.  He has an \nassociate's degree and computer certifications.  Applicant has been married for over 37 \nyears and has two daughters who have disabilities.  One daughter is still at home being \ncared for by his wife.  Applicant's net monthly income is approximately $7,000 from his \nsalary, Air Force retired pay, Veteran's Administration disability, and payments for his \ndisabled daughter.  His monthly expenses are approximately $3,000, leaving a monthly \nremainder in discretionary funds of about $4,000.  He also has about $10,000 in cash in \nhis home (Tr. 32-45, 66-68, Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated \nJanuary 10, 2008).  \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 3, dated November 3, 2008, and Gov. Ex. 4, dated \nJanuary 25, 2008) listed for Applicant a delinquent debt of $23,518 for a repossessed \nvehicle (SOR 1.a); a delinquent credit card debt of $13,027 (SOR 1.b); and another \n\n3 \n \ndelinquent credit card debt of $2,390 to the same creditor (SOR 1.c).  Applicant \npresented his most recent credit reports showing that all other obligations are either \npaid or paid as agreed, including his house mortgage (App. Ex. D, E, and F, Credit \nReports, dated May 25, 2009).  His credit score indicators are favorable when \ncompared with the national average (App. Ex. G, Credit rating, dated May 25, 2009).   \n \n \nApplicant was employed by a computer network firm in December 2000.  In the \nspring of 2001, he was promoted to regional manager and administrator in his home \nstate and an adjoining state with a considerable increase in pay and responsibilities.  \nHis employer projected that he would be required to travel extensively to various sites in \nthe states.  Applicant purchased a new car in the summer of 2001 so he had a reliable \ncar for the projected extensive travels in his new position.  He also opened two credit \ncard accounts at the request of his employer to use to charge expenses for his travels.  \nAt the recommendation of the credit card company, he also purchased payment \nprotection benefits from the company in case he became unemployed (Tr. 21-23).  He \npaid for the payment protection benefits as part of his credit card monthly payments \n(App. Ex. A, Credit card statement, dated December 25, 2002; App. Ex. B, Credit card \nstatement, dated January 9, 2003).   \n \n \nHis company started to lose contracts because of the events of September 11, \n2001.  The company terminated operations and Applicant became unemployed in \nNovember 2001.  He applied for and collected unemployment until March 2002 when he \nreceived a short contract for work in Saudi Arabia.  He completed that contract in \nAugust 2002, and returned home.  He continued to draw the remainder of his \nunemployment entitlements.  Applicant was able to find only sporadic work until January \n2008 when he started working for his present employer (Tr. 23-26).  In addition, his wife \nrequired kidney surgery in November 2001 that was partially paid by military medical \ninsurance.  He had a debt of approximately $5,000 from the surgery.  The debt was paid \noff in late 2004 after Applicant made monthly payments (Tr. 26, 53-54).   \n \n \nSOR 1.a is a delinquent debt for the repossession of the new car he purchased \nfor his new position in 2001.  Applicant made payments on the car loan until November \n2002 when his unemployment payments ran out and he was unable to continue to make \npayments on the loan.  The car was repossessed on the night of February 9, 2003.  The \nrepossession company towed the car from his driveway and it was damaged in the \nprocess.  Applicant found car parts in his driveway as well as skid marks where the car \nhad been dragged (Tr. 29-30).  Applicant paid over $35,000 for the car when \npurchased.  It was still in excellent condition with low mileage.  By the time the car was \nrepossessed, he had paid approximately a third of the cost.  Credit reports show a \nbalance owed after repossession of $23,158.  However, the bank notified Applicant after \nthe repossession that the loan amount remaining together with repossession charges \nwas $24,469.91.  The car sold for $19,236.  Applicant received other credits for total \ncredits of $20,016, leaving an amount owed by Applicant of $4,453.55 (App. Ex. C, \nBank Letter, dated May 7, 2003).  Applicant also contends that the wholesale value of \nthe car at the time of repossession was not $19,000 but over $26,000.  If the car had \nnot been damaged in the repossession, it would have sold for more than the $19,236 \nand he would have no debt or he would have been owed a remainder from the bank.  \n\n4 \n \nHe verbally protested the repossession charge with the bank but was informed they \nwere not responsible for the damage to the car.  Applicant does not believe he has a \nvalid debt for the repossessed car and he refuses to pay this charge (Tr. 30-31, 56-60, \n63-66, 69-71; Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, dated May 19, 2008 at 3).   \n \n \nSOR delinquent debts 1.b and 1.c are for the remainder from the credit cards \nopened by Applicant to use while traveling with his former employer.  When Applicant \nfirst opened these accounts, he purchased payment protection benefits at the \nsuggestion of the credit card company in case he was unemployed (Tr. 29; App. Ex. A, \nCredit card statement, dated December 25, 2002; App. Ex. B, Credit card statement, \ndated January 9, 2003).  Applicant continued to make payments on these accounts after \nhe was laid off until late 2002 when he no longer had sufficient income to meet his \nexpenses.  He applied for the payment protection benefits but was advised that since he \ndid not request payment within one year of loss, he was not eligible for the payment \nprotection benefits (Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, dated May 19, 2008 at 3-4; \nApp. Ex. H and I, Letters, dated January 3, 2003).  Even after receiving these letters, \nthe credit card company notified him that he was eligible for payment protection \ncoverage (App. Ex. J and K, Letters, dated January 31, 2003).  He has not received any \nbenefits from the payment protection account. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges that he owes approximately $5,000 on one account and \n$500 on the other account.  He is willing to pay these amounts if he can reach an \nagreement with the creditors (Tr. 71-77).  He has attempted to settle the accounts with \nthe collection agencies for the amount owed.  One collection agency refused to settle \nthe account and requests full payment (App. Ex. L, Letter, dated June 10, 2009).  The \nother company agreed to settle the alleged debt of $2,518.45 for $1,400 (App. Ex. N, \nLetter, date June 9, 2009).  Since Applicant believes he owes the creditor only $500, \nthis is not an acceptable settlement for him.  Applicant also notes that under the state \nstatute of limitation both debts are barred from collection (App. Ex. J, Applicant's letter, \ndated June 11, 2009; App. Ex. N, Statute of Limitations, undated).    \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \n\n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a public trust concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \n\n6 \n \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts from a car repossession and two credit cards, \nas established by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s statements and testimony, are a \nsecurity concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations).  Applicant has three delinquent debts over six years old \nindicating a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as an inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy his debts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances).  While the debts were incurred some time ago, they are still \nunpaid and thus considered current.  The debts occurred when Applicant's company \nclosed after the tragedy on September 11, 2001, and Applicant lost employment.  These \ncircumstances were beyond his control.  He was able to make payments on his debts \nafter being laid off for at least a year because of his retied pay and sporadic \nemployment.  In fact, he paid most of his debts except for the three listed in the SOR.  \nOne of the debts he did pay was a significant debt for his wife's kidney surgery.  The \ncircumstances of the delinquent debts being beyond his control and his actions to \nmanage and pay his debts in light of these circumstances show he acted responsibly \nand reasonably.  There are strong indications that delinquent debt is not likely to recur.  \nThe three debts do not now cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \n \n \nI have not considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control).  While Applicant's financial problems are under control or \nbeing resolved, he presented no information concerning financial counseling.   \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic method of handling debts is needed.  Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment.  A \"meaningful track \nrecord\" of debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments or \nreduction of debt through payment of debts.  An Applicant is not required to establish \nthat he paid off each and every debt listed.  The entirety of an Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which \nthat Applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \n\n7 \n \nrealistic.  Available, reliable information about the person's, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.  There is no \nrequirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.  \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts one at a time.  Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually \npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  All that is \nrequired is that Applicant demonstrates he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts.  He has a large sum of money in cash \nand has significant discretionary funds left each month.  Applicant presented significant \nand credible reasons for not paying the three outstanding debts.  His documents show \nthat at most the amount owed on the repossessed car was approximately $4,453.  Prior \nto the repossession, he paid over 30% of the loan.  He presented significant information \nto challenge the value of the car at repossession because of the damage done during \nrepossession.  If the car had not been damaged, there would be no remaining amount \ndue and he would not have a repossessed car debt.  Applicant refuses to pay the debt \nbecause he reasonably believes he does not have a debt for the car.   \n \nApplicant acknowledges that he owes some part of the credit card debts.  He \npresented sufficient information to establish that he paid the credit card company for a \npayment protection benefit that was denied by the creditor because it was not filed \nwithin one year of loss.  Applicant states the claim was filed within one year.  Applicant \nlost employment in November 2001.  He continued to make payment on his credit cards \nuntil late 2002 when he did request payment protection.  The creditor denied payment \nprotection coverage on January 3, 2003.  This denial was sufficiently close to the one \nyear mark to indicate Applicant filed within the one year period.  Applicant has a \nreasonable belief that he was wrongly denied payment protection benefits for which he \npaid.  His determination that he owes $5,000 on one account and $500 on the other \naccount is reasonable.  Applicant's attempts to settle the debts with the collection \nagencies are reasonable and in good faith.  He was willing to settle for the amount of \nthe debt owed.  It is the collection agencies that indicate an unwillingness to settle and \nbe reasonable.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provided \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve he issue).  Based on the information provided by Applicant, it is \nreasonable to conclude the he does not have a debt for the car repossession.  Likewise, \nApplicant disputed the credit card debts because he should have received the payment \nprotection benefit for which he contracted and paid.  He does acknowledge that he \nowes an amount on these accounts that is significantly less than requested and he is \nwilling to settle the accounts.  He has a reasonable basis for dispute and he provided \ndocumentation that he has disputed the charges. \n \nApplicant acted responsibly towards his debts.  His finances are under control.  \nApplicant presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for financial \n\n8 \n \nconsiderations by establishing his good-faith efforts to resolve his debts.  His finances \ndo not indicate a security concern.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant held a security clearance \nfor over 18 year with no indication of any security violation.  He has presented sufficient \ninformation to contest the public trust significance of the three delinquent debts.  He \nraised sufficient information to doubt a debt to him under the circumstances of the \nrepossession.  He established that his claim not to pay the car repossession debt is \nreasonable because he paid over 30% of the car loan and the value of the car except \nfor damage in the repossession process should have been sufficient to pay the \nremainder.   \n \nApplicant established a good-faith reasonable offer to pay the amount he owed \non the two credit cards.  The amount of the debt should be lower than alleged if he had \nreceived the payment protection benefits for which he paid the credit card company.  He \nindicated he would pay the debts if a settlement in the amount originally owed on the \ndebts could be reached.  It is noted that Applicant in his post-hearing submissions \ndiscussed the state statute of limitation on the enforcement of the debt.  However, it is \nnot his reliance on the statute of limitation that is reasonable but his attempts to settle \nthe debts.  It is the creditors who are being unreasonable in view of the amount needed \nto settle the debts.   \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment.  He has paid all \nof his debts as agreed except for the three listed in the SOR.  He has a reasonable and \nprudent reason for not paying the three SOR debts.  He established that he acted \nreasonably and responsibly towards his finances indicating he will act reasonably and \n\n9 \n \nresponsibly to protect sensitive information.  The three debts in question were directly \nwork related debts.  He acted reasonably before the debts became delinquent by \nmaking car loan payments on time, and signing up and paying for payment protection \nbenefits for his credit cards.  He acted reasonably by paying his debts as best he could \nafter losing his job.  He tried to find meaningful employment and paid his debts until he \nno longer could afford to pay them.  When he lost his job, he did not back away from his \ndebts but paid them for over a year.  He pays all of his other obligations as agreed \nincluding paying a significant expense for his wife's kidney surgery.  He demonstrated \nhe is responsibly managing his present finances under the circumstances.  The \nmanagement of present finances indicates he will be concerned, responsible, and not \ncareless concerning sensitive information.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from his financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 25, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 30, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2009. DOHA issued a \nOctober 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nnotice of hearing on July 16, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 5, 2009. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through G, which were received without objection. The record \nwas held open for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted two \nsets of documents, which were marked AE H through R and admitted without objection. \nAfter viewing Applicant\u2019s documents, I reopened the record to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional documents. Applicant submitted another set of documents, which were \nmarked AE S through YY and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s \nmemorandums are marked Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 12, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 65-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 1998. He is the deputy chief engineer on a major weapons \nsystem. He has worked on the same project, with his current employer or other defense \ncontractors, since 1984. He is a graduate of a service academy. He served as a military \nofficer after graduation and is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War. He has been \nmarried for 41 years. He has four children and four stepchildren. His wife was a widow \nwith four young children when he married her. Applicant\u2019s children are adopted. The \nthree youngest children are \u201cspecial needs\u201d children and still live with Applicant and his \nwife.1  \n \n \nApplicant traveled frequently for his job. Because of his time away from home, \nhis wife handled their finances. There is a casino close to where Applicant lives. His \nwife started gambling at the casino. She developed a severe gambling problem and \nincurred significant losses. She stopped paying the household bills, including their \nmortgage, in order to fund her gambling. Applicant became aware of the extent of her \ngambling, and how far behind they were, in about November 2006. By that time, they \nwere a number of months behind in their mortgage payments, and their lender was \nthreatening foreclosure.2  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in April 2007. They made \nsome payments to the trustee before the bankruptcy was dismissed in February 2008. \nApplicant testified the bankruptcy was dismissed because they were unable to maintain \nthe payments. He admitted another reason that he and his wife dismissed the \nbankruptcy was because she received a settlement from a lawsuit over an injury \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 47-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2: AE B, C. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nsustained in a car accident. He stated that the settlement was at least $40,000 and may \nhave been $75,000, but he did not know the actual figure. He and his wife did not want \nthe settlement to be considered in the bankruptcy for use in determining their payment \nplan. They did not use any of the settlement to pay their debts. His wife paid about \n$27,000 for a new car. Applicant stated that he did not know what she did with the \nremainder of the money. She indicated in a letter that she lost it gambling.3    \n \n \nApplicant lost his house to foreclosure in February 2008. He was about $17,000 \nbehind on the mortgage at one point. Applicant received an IRS Form 1099-A, \nAcquisition or Abandonment of Property. The form indicated that the fair market value of \nthe property when the lender obtained it was $298,114. The balance of the principal on \nthe mortgage was $267,396. Because of the equity in the property, no deficiency was \nowed on the mortgage.4    \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy, his delinquent mortgage, and three \nadditional delinquent debts totaling about $22,104. Applicant had not made payments \non any of the debts as of the date of hearing.5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted post-hearing documents that he sold to his sister ten shares \nof stock that he received as an inheritance. He stated that he did not realize the value of \nthe stock until he received a check for $66,180 from his sister\u2019s attorney on August 12, \n2009. He used the money from the sale to pay or settle his delinquent debts.6 \n \n \nApplicant settled the delinquent debt of $1,467 owed to a collection company on \nbehalf of a financial institution, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, with a payment of $660 on \nAugust 27, 2009.7   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a delinquent debt of $16,762 owed to a collection company on \nbehalf of a financial institution. Applicant settled the debt, which had grown to $16,910, \nwith a payment of $10,215 on August 27, 2009.8   \n \n \nApplicant settled the delinquent debt of $3,977 owed to a collection company on \nbehalf of an exercise equipment company, with a payment of $1,988 on August 27, \n2009. This debt was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e.9   \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 23-24, 42-44, 50-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE J. \n \n4 Tr. at 23-25, 31-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A. \n \n5 Tr. at 34, 47, 51-52. \n \n6 AE L, O-S. \n \n7 GE 2; AE OO, WW-YY. \n \n8 AE EE-HH. \n \n9 AE U-W. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn addition to the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant paid or settled seven \nadditional debts with payments totaling about $19,860. He also paid his tax year 2008 \nIRS debt of $2,876.10    \n \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling. His wife is receiving counseling for \nher gambling problem. She quit for a period and then started gambling again in about \nJune 2009. It is unclear if she is currently gambling, but she stated in a letter that \u201cdeep \ndown in [her] heart [she] never ever want[s] to gamble again.\u201d When he found out she \nhad a gambling problem, Applicant stopped her access to their funds. After she went a \nperiod without gambling, he returned her access to their accounts. She gambled away \nmuch of their funds.11 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a number of letters on his behalf. His job performance has \nbeen outstanding. He is praised for his, honesty, trustworthiness, patriotism, judgment, \nwork ethic, professionalism, leadership, dedication, and integrity. The authors \nrecommend that he retain his security clearance.12  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n10 AE T, X-DD, JJ-NN, PP-VV. \n \n11 Tr. at 25-33; AE D, E, I, J, L, M, S. \n \n12 AE D. \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues resulted from his wife\u2019s gambling problem. This \nqualifies as a condition that was outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has \nresolved all of the debts alleged in the SOR. He also resolved eight debts not alleged in \nthe SOR. He acted responsibly under the circumstances by making a good-faith effort to \nrepay his overdue creditors. He has receiving financial counseling, and there are \nindications that the problem is being resolved. His financial problems do not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), \nand 20(d) are all applicable  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \n65-year-old highly-regarded engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked on the \nsame weapons system for 25 years. He is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War. He \nhelped raise his stepchildren, and he and his wife adopted special needs children. His \nthree youngest children still live at home. \n \nApplicant, like many people who travel frequently for their job, left the family\u2019s \nfinances in the hands of his spouse. She developed a gambling problem and essentially \ndestroyed them out financially. They have resolved their delinquent debts through an \ninheritance. Applicant will never be completely financially secure because of his wife\u2019s \ngambling addiction. He needs to keep close watch on the situation, monitor their \nfinances, and quickly react to any indication that his wife is gambling. There is always \nthe possibility that her gambling will bring them additional financial hardships. However, \nI find that his record, history, and character are sufficient to mitigate that risk. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

He has also visited pornographic internet sites and,\nin 2001, he subscribed to a web site that permitted interaction with live models.  In the 1990s and\nin the early 2000s, he visited strip clubs, where he received \u201clap dances.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Since\n1998, Applicant has received psychological counseling for sexual addiction.  He has also attended\nmeetings of Sexaholics Anonymous (SA), a twelve step recovery program based on Alcoholics\nAnonymous.  Applicant has not had an incident of sexual misconduct since 2003.\nBetween 1988 and 1996, Applicant reported personal expenses (home maintenance items,\nupgrades to personal computers, etc.) as business expenses on his federal income tax returns.  He\nclaimed between $500 and $1000 of personal expenses and business expenses each year.  In 1997,\nanother Government agency revoked Applicant\u2019s security clearance due to his sexual behavior, his\nfailure to pay taxes, and software piracy.  \nIn addition to the misconduct outlined above, Applicant did not report on his federal income\ntax forms the true amount of rent he received from rental property.

Exhibit E are those tax returns, your tax returns?  A: Right.  Those were\nthe corrected sub forms that [Accountant] did.  Q: I thought he didn\u2019t correct them?  A: Oh he did correct them but there\nwas no reason to file the corrected form or any return.  Q: Because you didn\u2019t owe any money?  A: Right.\u201d  Tr. at 80.\n  \n3See GE 3 at 6:  \u201c[Applicant] indicated that he intends to commit perjury in the upcoming civil trial if he is\nasked directly about his involvement in this scheme. [Applicant] was asked to provide witnesses as to the cost of the\nrenovation work; in turn, he asked [B] to provide witnesses.  To [Applicant\u2019s] knowledge, [B] has friends who are\nwilling to testify to the higher prices charged as described previously.  He opined that these individuals are likely\nrepaying a favor to [B] or he may be compensating them in some way.\u201d\n  \n3\nDOHA interrogatories in 2008, and later, in his response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had\nsubmitted amended tax returns.  However, during the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not\nsubmit amended returns.2   \nSubsequently, Applicant served as the executor for his father\u2019s estate.  Pursuant to these\nduties, he sought to have a house placed on the market.  Applicant hired his brother-in-law (B) to\nmake renovations.  B had subcontractors submit two bids, one an actual bid and the other a false one.\nThe false bids, which were higher, were for accounting purposes.  The total amount of the contract\nwas $97,000.  The work was performed at less cost than reflected in the false bids, and B made a\nprofit of $47,000.  When Applicant complained about the cost of the renovations, B explained to him\nthe double bids and offered to split his profits with Applicant.  Applicant agreed and offered, in\nreturn, to split half of the executor fees with B.  Applicant received $23,734 from B.  Although B\u2019s\nwife knew of this arrangement, none of Applicant\u2019s other siblings were aware of it.  \nLater, Applicant\u2019s other siblings brought an action in court to have Applicant removed as\nexecutor.  In 2002, during an interview conducted by another Government agency, Applicant\nexplained his actions with B and advised that he had received about $23,000.  He told the\ninvestigator that, should he be directly asked about this at trial, he intended to commit perjury.  He\nstated to the interviewer that, if the $23,000 payment was discovered, he and B would claim that it\nwas for an unrelated business transaction.  Applicant told the investigator that B had friends who\nwould come to the deposition and testify about the false bids.3  \nAfter this interview, Applicant was questioned at a deposition.  He stated at the DOHA\nhearing that he did not believe that he had committed perjury at the deposition.  He stated that he\ntestified at the deposition that B had performed the renovations and that the $97,000 was the cost\nof the work.  \nThe parties settled the lawsuit, with Applicant remaining as executor but with fees limited\nto $35,000.  Applicant returned the $23,734 to B in 2002, two years after he had received it.  Except\nfor B\u2019s wife, none of Applicant\u2019s siblings were aware of this payment as of the close of the record.\n\n4See ISCR Case No. 02-06478 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2004), for a discussion of relevance.  \n4\nIn 2001, a U.S. military department denied Applicant a security clearance due to his sexual\nbehavior and involvement in the lawsuit.  Applicant\u2019s job performance evaluations state that he is\naccountable, honest, open and respectful in his conduct of company business.\nDue Process Issue\nApplicant contends that the Judge denied him due process, insofar as he relied upon record\nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s willingness to commit perjury.  Applicant argues that, because\nperjury was not alleged in the SOR, he was denied notice sufficient to enable him to prepare for the\nhearing.\nAn SOR is an administrative pleading that is not required to satisfy the strict requirements\nof a criminal indictment, and it does not have to allege every fact that may be relevant at the hearing.\nIt does not have to identify specific evidence that Department Counsel will rely on at the hearing.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08806 at 3 (App. Bd. May 8, 2007).  \nIn this case, Applicant\u2019s SOR alleged at paragraph 2(e): \u201cYou engaged in fraudulent activity\nin about 2000 while serving as executor of your father\u2019s estate by overcharging the estate for\nexpenses and keeping a share of the proceeds.\u201d  Furthermore, Government Exhibit (GE) 3, Agency\nInvestigation, contained the description of Applicant\u2019s interview with another Government agency\nconcerning his willingness to commit perjury.  This document was admitted into evidence with no\nobjection from Applicant.  Tr. at 10.  \nApplicant\u2019s stated willingness to perjure himself during the course of civil litigation\nchallenging his conduct as executor of his father\u2019s estate is relevant to evaluating the security\nsignificance of that conduct, as it was alleged in the SOR.4   A reasonable person in Applicant\u2019s\nposition would be expected to have foreseen that, when he received an SOR alleging that he had\nperpetuated fraud upon his father\u2019s estate, circumstances flowing from that alleged fraud, to include\nlegal action by aggrieved heirs, would be addressed at a hearing. Viewed as a whole, the record\ndemonstrates that Applicant was provided notice sufficient to enable him to prepare his case for\nmitigation. \nMoreover, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered for such purposes as assessing\nan applicant\u2019s credibility and evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence for extenuation or mitigation.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004).  In this case, the Judge discussed\nApplicant\u2019s deposition testimony in his evaluation of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.  Therefore,\nhe addressed it in its proper context.  There is no error in the Judge\u2019s treatment of this matter.   \nGovernment\u2019s Burden of Production\nApplicant contends that the Government failed to meet its burden of production concerning\nthe allegation that Applicant had engaged in fraudulent activity while serving as executor of his\n\n5Although we have not considered this transcript, we note that it does not appear to undermine the challenged\nstatement by the Judge.  \n6\u201cQ: . . . .And when you testified at the deposition did you talk about the money [B] gave you?  A: No, I did\nnot.  Q: So did you perjure yourself?  A: No, I did not . . . Q: That was not a specific question asked?  A: No, they didn\u2019t\nask any questions . . . Q: All right.  So nobody asked why it cost so much or anything like that?  A: Yes, I told them that\nwe fixed it up and that\u2019s what it cost.  Q: Well, wouldn\u2019t the appropriate answer to that be it cost so much because he\ngave me a $23,000 kickback?  A: No, I wasn\u2019t looking at it that way . . . Q: Were you prepared to perjure yourself if\nnecessary at your deposition?  A: No, I don\u2019t think I would have.  I fortunately was not tested.\u201d  Tr. at Tr. 117-118.   \n5\nfather\u2019s estate.  In a DOHA hearing, the Government\u2019s burden is to present substantial evidence\nregarding any controverted allegation.  Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.   \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s description of his agreement with B, as described in GE 3.\nThis document sets forth in some detail B\u2019s having submitted false bids for the house renovation.\nApplicant stated to the interviewer that, when he complained to B about the high cost of the\nrenovation, B offered to split the profits with him.  He stated that B faxed Applicant a document\nshowing how B used this \u201cmultiple bid\u201d system to his advantage.  GE 3 also describes Applicant\u2019s\nreply to a question about the extent to which his sharing the profits with B might subject him to\nblackmail: \u201cNo, not at the moment.  It\u2019s never been tested.  I\u2019d hope I\u2019d do the reasonable thing.\nI know you want me to say that I\u2019d never, but I don\u2019t know because its never been tested.\u201d  \nWe have also considered GE 2, Applicant\u2019s reply to DOHA interrogatories, in which\nApplicant stated that \u201cthis action was a poor decision on my part,\u201d that he had \u201cacted\ninappropriately\u201d in the exercise of his fiduciary responsibilities to the estate.  These documents,\nwhen considered along with the other evidence in the record, are sufficient to constitute substantial\nevidence of fraudulent actions.  While Applicant\u2019s testimony and documents denying an intent to\ndefraud were evidence the Judge was bound to consider, they are not sufficient to undermine his\nconclusion that the Government had met its burden of production as to Applicant\u2019s alleged\nfraudulent conduct.  \nApplicant\u2019s argument on this issue challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings, particularly a\nstatement in the Analysis portion of the decision that Applicant\u2019s deposition testimony was, at a\nminimum, \u201cintentionally misleading.\u201d  Decision at 11.  In support of this issue, Applicant has\nsubmitted new evidence not contained in the record, a transcript of his deposition testimony.  We\ncannot consider this new evidence.5  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received\nor considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29,\n2009).  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial evidence, or\nconstitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record.6  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009).  \nOther Issues\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case 09-01735 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2010).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a\nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made,\u2019\u201d both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.

In addition\nto the matters discussed above, we note evidence that Applicant engaged in security significant\nmisconduct, to include tax evasion and fraud, after having had a clearance revoked in 1997.  The\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

The doctor uses the term relapse, similar to what is used with other addictions. \nApplicant relapsed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He helped treat Applicant for his \nrelapses, and there have been no relapses in more than seven years. The doctor is \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 59-60, 135-136; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 73-74; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 63, 123; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n4 I am using the colloquial meaning of pornography and not the strict legal definition. \n \n5 Tr. at 65-68, 123-128; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ncurrently seeing Applicant for \u201crelapse management,\u201d so that he can maintain his sexual \nsobriety.6 The doctor testified: \n \nBecause it is an addictive concern . . . akin to alcohol, substance \naddictions, a person is always not really seen as fully cured in the same \nsense that they are always in recovery and they maintain sobriety. And to \nthe extent that he\u2019s maintained sexual sobriety has been over seven \nyears, which is a significant period of time, without relapse.7 \n \n \nApplicant was actively involved with Sexaholics Anonymous (SA) from 2002 to \n2006. Sexaholics Anonymous is a 12-step program based upon the model first \ndeveloped by Alcoholics Anonymous. He completed all 12 steps and he was a sponsor. \nHe has not relapsed since January 2003.8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has known about his sexual issues since the mid 1990s. She has \nbeen involved with his treatment since its inception. Her family is also aware of his \nissues. His children know about his sexual addiction issues, but they do not know all the \ndetails of what he has done.9 \n \n \nBetween about 1988 and 1996, Applicant reported personal expenses, such as \npaint and maintenance items for his home, office equipment, supplies, and upgrades to \nhis children\u2019s computers, as business expenses on his federal income tax returns. He \nwas interviewed by an investigator from another government agency in June 2002. He \ntold the investigator that he claimed $500 to $1,000 of personal expenses as business \nexpenses each year.10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked by another government agency in \n1997, due to his high-risk sexual behavior, tax issues, and software privacy. Applicant \nadmitted that his \u201cinterim clearance [was] revoked for risky sexual behavior,\u201d but he \n\u201cbelieve[d] the tax and software issues were mitigated by hearing.\u201d11 \n \n \nApplicant owned a rental property. On his 1999 and 2000 income tax returns, he \nunderreported the amount he received in rent from his tenants. He told the investigator \nin 2002 that he took in $875 each month, but he only reported $600 each month. The \ndifference for the two years was about $3,000. In his response to DOHA interrogatories \nin October 2008, Applicant wrote that he \u201cfiled amended returns in 2002. Because of \nother deductions found by [his] accountant, there was no additional tax or penalty.\u201d In \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 21-40, 123; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n7 Tr. at 24. \n \n8 Tr. at 40-47, 131-135, 145-146; GE 2. \n \n9 Tr. at 48-53, 56-58, 62. \n \n10 Tr. at 75-78; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n11 Tr. at 79-80; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n\n \n4 \n \nhis response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \u201cto not reporting all income. Upon \nsubmitting amended returns that included the unreported income and deductions not \npreviously taken, [he] owed no taxes for those years.\u201d Contrary to those assertions, \nApplicant did not submit amended returns. His accountant reviewed his records, but \nApplicant did not submit amended returns because the accountant told him that he \nwould not owe the IRS any additional money. The rental property was sold in about \n2005.12  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in about 1980. His father never completely \nsettled the estate. Applicant\u2019s father died in 2000. The value of both estates was about \n$3.5 million. Applicant was named the executor for both estates. Applicant stated that \nhe could have received executor fees of between three to five percent of the value of \nthe estates, or between $100,000 and $150,000. He stated that he never intended to \ntake that amount. Applicant\u2019s brother has psychological problems. When their father \ndied, Applicant\u2019s brother was living by himself in their mother\u2019s old house. Their father \nmaintained the house for the brother. The brother is currently living in a psychiatric \nfacility. Applicant and his sister are his guardians. There was concern after his father \npassed as to who would care for the brother. Applicant\u2019s sister and her husband helped \nApplicant with his duties as executor, which included sorting through a massive amount \nof records and documents.13 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law was a building contractor. Applicant\u2019s father had \nemployed him on several occasions to make repairs to Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s house. \nActing as the executor, Applicant employed his brother-in-law to renovate the house \nbefore it was placed on the market. Applicant did not secure bids from other contractors \nbut relied on the brother-in-law that the bid he submitted was reasonable. The brother-\nin-law had subcontractors, who were friends, submit two bids, a real bid and a false \nhigher bid. He submitted the false bids to Applicant for his records. The brother-in-law \nwas able to complete the project for less than the false bids. Applicant testified that the \nbrother-in-law\u2019s bids were genuine bids. Applicant paid the brother-in-law about $97,000 \nfor the job. The brother-in-law made a profit of about $47,500. In about the summer of \n2001, Applicant complained to the brother-in-law about the high cost of the renovation. \nThe brother-in-law explained to Applicant about the double bids, and offered to split half \nthe profits with Applicant. Applicant agreed and offered to split his fees as executor with \nhim. The brother-in-law paid Applicant half the profit, which was $23,734. Applicant\u2019s \nsister who was married to the contractor was aware of the money going to Applicant, \nbut none of his other siblings were aware of the payment.14  \n \n                                                          \n12 Tr. at 77-80, 122; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE D, E. \n \n13 Tr. at 82-91, 98; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE I. \n \n14 Tr. at 91-104, 107-112, 138; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has four siblings. Three of the siblings brought action in probate court \nto have Applicant removed as executor. Part of the complaint was Applicant\u2019s \nemploying his brother-in-law.15 \n \n \nIn his June 2002 interview by an investigator from another government agency, \nApplicant explained the actions with his brother-in-law and that he received about \n$23,000. He told the investigator that he planned to commit perjury at the upcoming trial \nif asked directly about his involvement in the renovations. He stated that he and the \nbrother-in-law agreed that if the $23,000 payment was discovered, they would claim that \nthe payment was for a business proposal that Applicant wrote for the brother-in-law. He \ntold the investigator that his brother-in-law had friends who were willing to come into \ncourt and testify about the false bids.16   \n \n \nApplicant was deposed for the lawsuit in about June 2002. He stated that he did \nnot testify at the deposition about the $23,734 received from the brother-in-law. He \nstated that he did not believe he committed perjury because he was not asked a specific \nquestion about accepting money from the brother-in-law. He stated that he testified at \nthe deposition that the brother-in-law renovated the house and the contract price of \nabout $97,000 was the cost of the renovation. Applicant returned the $23,734 to his \nbrother-in-law in about July 2002. His brother-in-law was deposed in about September \n2002. Applicant stated that his brother-in-law \u201copened his records, all the records to the \ncourt.\u201d It is unclear if Applicant was talking about the false bids, or if the brother-in-law \nactually produced the accurate bids. The brother-in-law did not admit that he gave \nApplicant $23,734. Applicant testified at his DOHA hearing that he could not even \nconceive of perjuring himself.17 \n \n \nThe lawsuit to remove Applicant as executor was settled in about November \n2002. The parties agreed that Applicant would remain as executor. His fees as executor \nwere limited to $35,000. Other provisions included that Applicant would file estate tax \nreturns within 60 days; he would provide each heir a quarterly accounting; he would \nobtain their approval for any single estate expense exceeding $5,000; and the residual \nestate, if any, would be held in trust for Applicant\u2019s brother. Applicant inherited about \n$750,000 from the estates. He also received about $40,000 from life insurance. Other \nthan the sister married to the contractor, Applicant\u2019s siblings are still not aware of the \n$23,734 payment.18 Applicant was asked at his hearing how he felt about taking the \ncheck from his brother-in-law: \n \n                                                          \n15 Tr. at 98, 139; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n16 GE 3. \n \n17 Tr. at 114-120, 142.  \n \n18 Tr. at 99, 113-114, 137-140; AE A, B. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWell it was really stupid I mean and I feel bad and I had to explain it to \nseveral people and after a lot of reflection I don\u2019t feel like I did anything \nmorally wrong but I never seem to get that across to people.19  \n \n \nIn about 2001, Applicant was denied a security clearance by one of the branches \nof the military due to his sexual behavior and involvement in civil law suits.20 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a letter attesting to his job performance, technical skills, \nprofessionalism, and good judgment. His performance evaluations reported that he \nexhibited the company\u2019s ethics principles of accountability, honesty, integrity, openness, \nand respect in the conduct of the company business.21   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n                                                          \n19 Tr. at 145. \n \n20 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n21 AE G, H. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12, as follows: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which can \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(a) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal behavior with prostitutes and his other compulsive sexual \nbehavior establish all of the above disqualifying conditions.  \n\n \n8 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant \u201csolicited and paid prostitutes for sexual \nactivities from about 1976 to at least September 2001.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that \nApplicant \u201ccontinued [his] involvement with prostitutes even though [he] knew that it was \nan issue in [his] security clearance in 1995.\u201d That constitutes facts and circumstances \nsurrounding the sexual behavior that is already alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. I conclude SOR \u00b6 \n1.b for Applicant.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant received treatment at a counseling center from \n1998 to 2008. Counseling and treatment are matters in mitigation. The allegation does \nnot raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.f is concluded for Applicant.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant \u201chad problems in [his] marriage due to [his] \nsexual behavior.\u201d That allegation, even if true, constitutes consequences of the sexual \nbehavior that is already alleged in the SOR. I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.g for Applicant.  \nConditions that could mitigate Sexual Behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress.  \n \nApplicant has been in counseling for his sexual addiction since 1998. He \nattended Sexaholics Anonymous and has maintained his sexual sobriety, without \nrelapse, since early 2003. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior is not recent. However, for AG \u00b6 \n14(b) to be applicable, there must also be a finding that the sexual behavior is unlikely \nto recur and that it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. At this point, his sexual behavior may be unlikely to occur. However, \ndespite the passage of time, I find that Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual acts continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b) is \npartially applicable. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and other important people in his life are aware of his sexual \nissues, which has reduced his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6 \n14(b) is applicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n9 \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of propriety information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation; \n \n      \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. He provided false \ninformation on income tax returns. He violated his duties as the executor of his parents\u2019 \nestate by accepting a payment from his contractor brother-in-law. He was involved in \nquestionable and illegal sexual behavior that included frequenting prostitutes. All the \nabove disqualifying conditions are applicable. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked in 1997 due to \nhis high risk sexual behavior, tax issues, and software privacy. SOR \u00b6 2.f alleges that \nApplicant was denied a security clearance in about 2001 due to his risky sexual \nbehavior and involvement in civil law suits. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.f do not allege distinctive \nconduct by Applicant. They allege the action of the Government in response to personal \nconduct already alleged. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.f are concluded for Applicant. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nApplicant has not used illegal drugs since 1988. His income tax issues occurred \nmore than nine years ago. He stated that his accountant reviewed his documents and it \nwas unnecessary to file amended returns because he does not owe any additional \ntaxes. He obtained counselling for his sexual problems and attended Sexaholics \nAnonymous. He has maintained his sexual sobriety since January 2003. The important \npeople in his life are aware of his sexual addiction. He returned the payment he \n\n \n11 \n \nreceived from his brother-in-law in 2002. All these factors show some mitigation under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(g) for the individual acts alleged in the SOR. \nHowever, when I view the totality of his acts, I remain concerned about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. I am particularly concerned about Applicant\u2019s violation of his fiduciary duties \nas executor and his willingness to commit perjury. Applicant denies committing perjury, \nor that he ever even considered committing perjury. At a minimum, his testimony had to \nhave been intentionally misleading. Other than his sister who is married to the \ncontractor, his siblings are still unaware of the payment.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that Personal Conduct concerns remain despite the presence \nof some mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines D and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence and his efforts to control \nhis sexual addiction problems. However, he exhibited a history of illegal and dishonest \nbehavior. I have significant unresolved concerns about his honesty, trustworthiness, \njudgment, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Sexual Behavior concerns, but he has not mitigated \nPersonal Conduct security concerns.  \n\n \n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.d-2.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 11, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nItem 4 contains, inter alia, the two articles and the note, which was written by A and addressed to Applicant.\n1\nIt describes A\u2019s anger over the molestation.  The Judge stated that he considered the fact that the note was sent to\nApplicant but that he did not consider it for the truth of the matters contained therein.  Decision at 2.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant continued as an adult Scout leader at least through 2005.  Applicant admitted\n2\nthis allegation in his response to the SOR.    \n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On October 2, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge mis-weighed the record\nevidence; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we\naffirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He holds\na Masters degree in Engineering.  He is married with two children.\nApplicant has a long association with the Boy Scouts of America.  He was a Scout as a youth\nand later served as an adult leader.  From 1986 to 1987, while a Scout leader, Applicant engaged in\nsexual contact with a Boy Scout (A), who was 15 and 16 years old.  Three of the incidents occurred\nduring Scout-sponsored events and another four occurred either at Applicant\u2019s home or on trips taken\nwith the knowledge and consent of A\u2019s parents.  During several of the incidents, either Applicant\nor A or both had consumed alcohol.  In fact, Applicant provided the alcohol on more than one\noccasion.   \nApplicant met his wife in 1987.  After that, he had no further sexual contact with A who,\nnevertheless, was an usher at Applicant\u2019s wedding and babysat for Applicant\u2019s older child.  \nIn 2003 Applicant received a phone call from an old girlfriend of A.  \u201cShe told him that she\nwas in possession of some letters that indicated that Applicant had sexually abused A.  She asked\nto meet Applicant to discuss the letters.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Later the same woman phoned Applicant\u2019s\nwife, telling her about the molestation.  Applicant subsequently received two envelopes in the mail,\nwhich contained articles about child abuse.  The second envelope also contained a handwritten note.1\nIn 2004 Applicant admitted his sexual involvement with A to his wife and to government\ninvestigators.  As a consequence, a government agency revoked Applicant\u2019s access to Sensitive\nCompartmented Information (SCI).  Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR included a copy of his written\nappeal of the 2005 SCI denial.  The appeal contains numerous letters praising Applicant\u2019s character,\njob performance, loyalty, and reliability.  It also contains letters from people who know Applicant\nthrough the Boy Scouts.   These letters state that they trust Applicant with their children.  \u201cNone of\n2\n\n3\nthe letters stated that the authors were aware of Applicants\u2019s sexual relationship with a [S]cout.\u201d  Id.\nat 5.  The appeal also contained a psychological evaluation of Applicant, which concluded that he\nwas not a pedophile and that there is little likelihood that anything like Applicant\u2019s conduct with A\nwould happen again.\nOn appeal, Applicant appears to contend that the Judge either did not consider or that he mis-\nweighed favorable evidence, such as the letters of reference and the psychological evaluation.\nHowever, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n2008).  Indeed, the Judge explicitly addressed the evidence cited by Applicant.  However, he also\nprovided a reasonable explanation for his conclusion that Applicant had failed to meet his burden\nof persuasion as to mitigation.  The Judge noted the serious nature of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, in that\nit involved multiple incidents in which he abused a position of trust and responsibility.  He also\nnoted a paucity of record evidence as to the current nature, if any, of Applicant\u2019s interactions with\nA and that Applicant retains an association with the Boy Scouts, although the record provides no\nreason to believe that Scouting officials or parents are aware of his misconduct.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant remains vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress.\nApplicant has provided no reason to believe that the Judge failed to consider record evidence or that\nhe mis-weighed the evidence.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He has two children, ages 19 and 17.1 Applicant was a member of the Boy Scouts of America when he was a youth. He maintained his association with the Boy Scouts as an adult and served as a scout leader in the 1980\u2019s.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nE, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 26, 2009, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nOctober 2, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nthe government\u2019s written case on July 7, 2009. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 17, 2009. He responded to the FORM on August \n9, 2009. Department Counsel did not object to his response. Applicant\u2019s response to the \nFORM contained ambiguous language suggesting that he may have wanted a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel called and left a voice mail for Applicant and sent him a letter on \nAugust 28, 2009, asking him if he wanted a hearing. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 2, 2009. I asked Department Counsel to verify that Applicant did not desire a \nhearing. Department Counsel submitted a memorandum on September 16, 2009, \nindicating that he spoke with the Applicant, and Applicant confirmed that he did not want \na hearing.  \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \nApplicant submitted a motion in limine objecting to the admission of certain of the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. Item 4 of the FORM consists of various documents from \nanother government agency regarding the agency\u2019s determination of Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Applicant objects on \nthe grounds of hearsay and the denial of his right to confrontation. Applicant specifically \nobjects to the \u201cpolygraph exam report,\u201d as a report of investigation (ROI), and therefore \ninadmissible under the Directive. There is no evidence in the FORM of the specific \nresults of a polygraph. The objection to any results of a polygraph test is sustained. \nApplicant presumably is objecting to the various reports of statements made by \nApplicant and other individuals included in the file. Applicant adopted his statements \nand their accuracy in 2005, in his response to the revocation of his access to SCI. His \nattorney stated in that response, with Applicant\u2019s express written approval, \u201c[t]he events \noccurred basically as reported in the report of the 23 and 24 August 2004 interviews \nand the 10 September 2004 polygraph examination; however [Applicant] denies forcing \nthe teen to perform oral sex on him during a trip to [amusement park] in 1987.\u201d When he \nresponded to the SOR, Applicant provided a copy of the 2005 response to the \nrevocation of his access to SCI. Applicant\u2019s objection to the ROIs that report his \nstatements to investigators is overruled, with the limitation that any indication that \nApplicant forced the teenager to perform oral sex on him during a trip to an amusement \npark in 1987 will not be considered. \n \nApplicant\u2019s objection to the admission of the ROIs of other individuals is \nsustained. Those ROIs will not be considered in this decision. Included in the \ninvestigative file from the other government agency is a letter reportedly sent to \nApplicant in about 2003, by the man who Applicant allegedly had a sexual relationship \nwith when the man was a teenager. Also included is a handwritten eight-page note from \nthe man apparently to the Applicant. The note was provided to the agency\u2019s investigator \nby the man\u2019s attorney. Applicant did not specifically object to the letter and the note. The \nletter and note are accepted for the limited purpose of the fact the letter was sent and \nthe note was written by the man. They are not accepted for the truth of the matters set \nforth therein. Therefore, the hearsay objection to the letter and note is overruled. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nIncluded in Item 4 is the decision and supporting memorandum revoking \nApplicant\u2019s access to SCI. The decision and memorandum are accepted for the limited \npurpose of establishing that Applicant\u2019s access to SCI was revoked. They are not \naccepted for the truth of the facts set forth therein. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a Masters of \nEngineering degree. He has been married since 1988. He has two children, ages 19 \nand 17.1  \n \n \nApplicant was a member of the Boy Scouts of America when he was a youth. He \nmaintained his association with the Boy Scouts as an adult and served as a scout \nleader in the 1980\u2019s. He first met one of his scouts (A) in about 1984 or 1985, when the \nboy was about 13 years old. Applicant took an interest in the boy and befriended him. \nDuring the period of about 1986 to 1987, Applicant became involved sexually with the \nboy. The first incident occurred on a Boy Scout camping trip in 1986, during which \nApplicant and the boy shared a tent. The boy was 15 years old at the time, and \nApplicant was about 28 years old. Between 1986, when the boy was 15, and 1987, \nwhen he was 16, Applicant and the boy had seven incidents involving sexual contact. \nThree of the incidents occurred when the boy was 15, and four occurred when he was \n16. Three of the incidents occurred during official scouting trips, and four occurred either \nat Applicant\u2019s home or during trips they took with approval of the boy\u2019s parents. The \nincidents took place in four different states. Several of the incidents occurred when \nApplicant and/or the boy had been drinking alcohol. Applicant provided A with alcohol \non more than one of the occasions. The sexual contact involved fondling of the penis \nand fellatio on at least one occasion.2  \n \n \nApplicant met his wife in 1987. His friendship with A continued after he met his \nwife, but there were no further sexual incidents. He stated they remained friends, and A \nwas an usher in Applicant\u2019s wedding and babysat for his oldest child. There is no \nevidence of any inappropriate sexual acts by Applicant after his sexual relationship with \nA ended.3   \n \n \nApplicant received a phone call in about September 2003 from an old girlfriend of \nA. She told him that she was in possession of some letters that indicated that Applicant \nhad sexually abused A. She asked to meet Applicant to discuss the letters. He told her \nthat he did not want to meet and ended the phone conversation. Several days later, \nApplicant\u2019s wife received a phone call from the same woman. She stated that Applicant \nsexually molested A when he was a Boy Scout. Applicant\u2019s wife told the woman that it \nwas a \u201csick lie\u201d and not to call their house again. In about March 2004, Applicant \n                                                          \n1 Item 6. \n \n2 Items 3-5. \n \n3 Id. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nreceived an envelope in the mail containing an article about child abuse. The envelope \ndid not have a return address. In about May or June 2004, Applicant received another \nenvelope in the mail. This letter had A\u2019s return address. It contained another article \nabout child abuse and a short handwritten note.4     \n \n \nIn August and September 2004, Applicant was interviewed on three occasions by \ninvestigators on behalf of a government agency for a determination of his eligibility for \naccess to SCI. He admitted his sexual involvement with A. In about August 2004, \nApplicant told his wife about his sexual relationship with A.5 \n \n \nIn 2005, the government agency issued a letter indicating its intent to revoke \nApplicant\u2019s access to their Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). \nApplicant appealed the decision and submitted a psychological evaluation by a licensed \npsychologist. The evaluation was conducted over a period of months and involved \nmultiple clinical interviews, formal psychological testing, and meetings with Applicant\u2019s \nwife.6 The psychologist found no Axis I or Axis II diagnosis. He concluded: \n \nIn summary, it appears that [Applicant] has grown considerably in the \neighteen years since the inappropriate relationship occurred. Outside of \nthat incident, [Applicant] has apparently lived a clean life without any \npersonal, legal, financial, occupational, psychological or behavioral \nproblems. In those years he has developed an impressive personal and \nprofessional record while successfully holding a security clearance for \nover twenty years. \n \nGiven the time that has passed, the lifestyle [Applicant] has developed \nand the maturation he has shown in his personal growth, there is very little \nlikelihood that anything like this incident could ever happen again. As \nthere are no psychological reasons otherwise and due to his overall \nhistory of stability, reliability, consistency and trustworthiness, it would \nseem more than reasonable to consider [Applicant] for continuation of his \nlongstanding security clearance and professional employment.7 \n \n \nThe decision to revoke Applicant\u2019s access to TS/SCI was sustained by the \nagency in June 2005. Applicant appealed that decision and submitted a supplemental \nreport by the licensed psychologist who conducted his evaluation. The psychologist \nreiterated his previous report. He reported that Applicant was not a pedophile and had \nnever engaged in pedophilia, as A was post-pubescent during the sexual acts. The \nresults of Applicant\u2019s appeal are not in the FORM, but Applicant left employment with \nthe agency in about October 2005, and indicated on his Questionnaire for National \n                                                          \n4 Items 3, 4. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. \n \n7 Id. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) submitted in March 2008, that his access to SCI was revoked \nin October 2005.8  \n \n \nWhen he submitted his response to the SOR, Applicant submitted a copy of the \n2005 appeal of his SCI revocation. There were a number of character letters attached to \nhis appeal package. Co-workers and supervisors praised Applicant for his outstanding \njob performance, judgment, competence, loyalty, and reliability. There were also a \nnumber of letters from people who knew him from the Boy Scouts. They wrote that \nApplicant was a great husband and father; they noted his commitment and dedication to \nthe Boy Scouts; and they stated how much they trusted him with their children. None of \nthe letters stated that the authors were aware of Applicant\u2019s sexual relationship with a \nscout.9   \n \n \nThere is little in the FORM or from Applicant to indicate what has occurred since \n2005. Because Applicant did not elect a hearing, I was unable to ask him if there has \nbeen any further contact with A or his girlfriend. Applicant was a scout leader in 2005. \nHe admitted SOR \u00b6 1.e, which alleged that \u201c[a]s of at least 2005, [Applicant was] still an \nadult leader with the Boy Scouts of America, and [his] past behavior was not known to \ncurrent youth parents or the Boy Scouts of America professional leadership.\u201d Nothing in \nApplicant\u2019s response indicates that he has disassociated himself from the Boy Scouts, \nor that they are now aware of his past actions with a scout.10   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n                                                          \n8 Items 3-6. \n \n9 Item 3. \n \n10 Id. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n\n \n7 \n \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct with the scout could also have been alleged under the \nSexual Behavior and Criminal Conduct guidelines. That behavior, when considered as a \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, and unwillingness to comply with rules, regulations, and the law. AG \n\u00b6 16(c) is applicable. That behavior and Applicant\u2019s apparently ongoing relationship with \nthe Boy Scouts also constitute personal conduct and concealment of information about \nhis conduct that could create a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \n\u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he was denied SCI access by another government \nagency in about 2005, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He was denied SCI access because of \nthe information that is also alleged in the SOR. SOR \u00b6 1.d does not allege distinct \npersonal conduct by Applicant. It alleges the agency\u2019s response to his conduct. That \nconduct is adequately addressed under other allegations. SOR \u00b6 1.d is concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n \nApplicant engaged in an inappropriate and criminal sexual relationship with a boy \nunder his care and supervision in 1986 and 1987. He married shortly thereafter, and \nthere is no evidence that this type behavior has been repeated. It has been 22 years \nsince the conduct. Applicant told his wife in 2004 about his actions, which lessened, but \n\n \n8 \n \ndid not eliminate, his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. Applicant is \napparently still heavily involved as a scout leader in the Boy Scouts. I question the \njudgment of someone who would remain connected to the Boy Scouts, after betraying \nthe organization and going against everything it stands for. The many letters Applicant \nsubmitted with the appeal of his SCI revocation do not help his case, because the \nparents of the children he was supervising clearly were unaware of Applicant\u2019s \ninappropriate actions with a scout. I am also concerned about the efforts of A and A\u2019s \nold girlfriend to contact Applicant and his wife in 2003 and 2004. The girlfriend\u2019s \nmotivations in contacting Applicant are unclear, but it was possibly part of an attempt to \nblackmail him.  \n \n \nQuestions remain unanswered about this case. I find that Applicant remains \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. His actions continue to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. With my many unanswered \nquestions, I am unable to make an affirmative finding that the behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. The Personal Conduct concerns are still present despite the presence of some \nmitigation.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \n51-year-old married father of two. He has been involved with the Boy Scouts for much \nof his life, either as a scout or a scout leader. When he was in his late 20\u2019s, he became \nsexually involved with a teenage scout who was under his care and supervision. The \nsexual incidents occurred when the boy was 15 and 16, with a number of the incidents \ninvolving alcohol supplied by Applicant. The incidents occurred in four states, and \n\n \n9 \n \nhappened during official scouting trips, at Applicant\u2019s home, or during trips they took \nwith approval of the boy\u2019s parents. Applicant crossed state lines prior to engaging in his \nillegal sexual acts with the minor. \n \nApplicant met his wife in 1987. They married in 1988. There is no evidence of \nany additional inappropriate sexual behavior by Applicant. He informed his wife of his \nactions in 2004. However, Applicant apparently is still associated with the Boy Scouts. \nThe Boy Scouts and the parents of his scouts are unaware of his inappropriate sexual \nactions with a scout under his care. That in itself shows questionable judgment. He \nmust know that the parents of the scouts he supervises would not have the same trust \nin him if they were aware of his past actions. The girlfriend of the boy he abused \ncontacted Applicant and his wife in 2003. Her motivations for the contact are not \ncompletely clear, but it could have been an extortion attempt. Little is available in the \nFORM about what has occurred since 2005. I was unable to ask Applicant important \nquestions about this case. Applicant\u2019s criminal actions are likely barred by the various \nstate and federal statutes of limitations. However, even if he can no longer be \nprosecuted, Applicant remains vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and \nduress.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Personal Conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

He was a Scout as a youth\nand later served as an adult leader.  From 1986 to 1987, while a Scout leader, Applicant engaged in\nsexual contact with a Boy Scout (A), who was 15 and 16 years old.  Three of the incidents occurred\nduring Scout-sponsored events and another four occurred either at Applicant\u2019s home or on trips taken\nwith the knowledge and consent of A\u2019s parents.  During several of the incidents, either Applicant\nor A or both had consumed alcohol.  In fact, Applicant provided the alcohol on more than one\noccasion.   \nApplicant met his wife in 1987.  After that, he had no further sexual contact with A who,\nnevertheless, was an usher at Applicant\u2019s wedding and babysat for Applicant\u2019s older child.  \nIn 2003 Applicant received a phone call from an old girlfriend of A.  \u201cShe told him that she\nwas in possession of some letters that indicated that Applicant had sexually abused A.  She asked\nto meet Applicant to discuss the letters.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Later the same woman phoned Applicant\u2019s\nwife, telling her about the molestation.  Applicant subsequently received two envelopes in the mail,\nwhich contained articles about child abuse.  The second envelope also contained a handwritten note.1\nIn 2004 Applicant admitted his sexual involvement with A to his wife and to government\ninvestigators.  As a consequence, a government agency revoked Applicant\u2019s access to Sensitive\nCompartmented Information (SCI).  Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR included a copy of his written\nappeal of the 2005 SCI denial.  The appeal contains numerous letters praising Applicant\u2019s character,\njob performance, loyalty, and reliability.  It also contains letters from people who know Applicant\nthrough the Boy Scouts.   These letters state that they trust Applicant with their children.  \u201cNone of\n2\nthe letters stated that the authors were aware of Applicants\u2019s sexual relationship with a [S]cout.\u201d  Id.\nat 5.  The appeal also contained a psychological evaluation of Applicant, which concluded that he\nwas not a pedophile and that there is little likelihood that anything like Applicant\u2019s conduct with A\nwould happen again.\nOn appeal, Applicant appears to contend that the Judge either did not consider or that he mis-\nweighed favorable evidence, such as the letters of reference and the psychological evaluation.\nHowever, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n2008).  Indeed, the Judge explicitly addressed the evidence cited by Applicant.  However, he also\nprovided a reasonable explanation for his conclusion that Applicant had failed to meet his burden\n\n3\nof persuasion as to mitigation.  The Judge noted the serious nature of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, in that\nit involved multiple incidents in which he abused a position of trust and responsibility.  He also\nnoted a paucity of record evidence as to the current nature, if any, of Applicant\u2019s interactions with\nA and that Applicant retains an association with the Boy Scouts, although the record provides no\nreason to believe that Scouting officials or parents are aware of his misconduct.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant remains vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress.\nApplicant has provided no reason to believe that the Judge failed to consider record evidence or that\nhe mis-weighed the evidence.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified a security clearance application (SF-86) on \nJanuary 16, 2008. On February 25, 2008, he was interviewed by an authorized \ninvestigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and provided information \nabout his financial obligations. On February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nAugust 20, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n Applicant responded to the SOR on March 18, 2009, and he requested that his \ncase be adjudicated on the written record in lieu of a hearing. His response did not \ncontain admissions or denials of five of the eleven allegations on the SOR. When this \nomission was brought to his attention, Applicant provided a complete response to the \nSOR allegations on April 29, 2009. The Government compiled its File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on May 28, 2009. The FORM contained documents identified as Items \n1 through 9. By letter dated June 1, 2009, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within \n30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on June 5, 2009.  His response was due \non July 5, 2009. He did not file additional information within the required time period. On \nAugust 6, 2009, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains eleven allegations of financial delinquency under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.k.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted all eleven of the Guideline F allegations. He provided the following \nexplanation in response to each allegation: \n \nI admit to the statement. Due to my spouse being unemployed I have \ntaken sole responsibility of all household financial problems that occur. I \nhave to provide for my wife, three children and as well as other day to day \ntasks which may have [played] a factor in late payments, or no payments \nat all. I am not trying to run from my debt, nor has this debt affected my \njudgment as an upstanding DOD employee for over 9 years.  I just have to \nmake lower payment at this time. Thanks for your understanding. \n \n  Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered herein as findings of fact.  (Item 1; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and employed as a help desk technician by a \ngovernment contractor. He is a high school graduate, married, and the father of three \nyoung children. He has held a security clearance since approximately 1998. (Item 6.)  \n \n \nApplicant has been steadily employed since 1997. The record is silent about the \nnature and duration of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s employment and unemployment.  (Item 6.) \n \n \nThe eleven delinquent accounts alleged on the SOR were listed on Applicant\u2019s   \ncredit reports of January 30, 2008 and August 26, 2008. He admitted all eleven \ndelinquent debts, which totaled approximately $18,988. Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect \nthat these accounts became delinquent between 2004 and 2008. His largest debt is a \npersonal loan delinquency of $10,767 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). The account was opened in July \n2005 and charged off in January 2008. Applicant is responsible for four delinquent \naccounts in amounts between $1,000 and $2,327 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., 1.g., and 1.h.). His \nremaining financial delinquencies are debts of $196 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.), $820 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.), \n$405 (SOR \u00b6 1.f.), $80 (SOR \u00b6 1.i.), $227 (SOR \u00b6 1.j.), and $120 (SOR \u00b6 1.k.).  (Item 1; \nItem 7; Item 9.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all eleven debts. However, in an \ninterview with an authorized investigator in February 2008, he claimed he was \nfinancially sound and current on all his debts. Additionally, he claimed in the interview \nthat he had satisfied the $120 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k; that he had negotiated a \npayment plan of $225 a month with the creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.a; and that he had \nsatisfied the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. He provided no documentation to show that he \nhad satisfied or made payments on these or any other debts alleged on the SOR.  \nNothing in the record establishes that Applicant has sought and received consumer \ncredit counseling.  (Item 5, Item 8 at 9.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Between 2004 and 2008, Applicant accumulated substantial \ndelinquent debt and the record reflects that he did not pay his creditors. This evidence is \nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, [such as] loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence the person \u201chas received or is receiving counseling for \nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c); that \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (d)); or that \u201cthe individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(e)). 1 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least the period \nof 2004 to 2008. Moreover, the delinquencies remain unpaid and have occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur. He has not sought consumer credit counseling \nthat could provide him with strategies for resolving his delinquent debts. While he \nattributed his delinquent debt to his wife\u2019s unemployment, he did not specify when she \nwas employed or became unemployed and how her unemployment directly impacted \nthe family\u2019s income. \n \nIt is unclear from the record whether Applicant has sufficient resources to pay or \nsettle his delinquent debts. The record does not reflect that the circumstances that gave \nrise to his delinquencies were beyond his control. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant \nstated that because of his current familial obligations, he was delinquent in paying some \ndebts and had not paid others at all. In determining an individual's security worthiness, \nthe Government cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might resolve his or her \noutstanding debts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, \n1999). I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply in \nmitigation to the security concerns raised by the facts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n \n1A sixth possible mitigating circumstance applies when \u201cthe affluence resulted from a legal source \nof income.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(f)). This mitigating circumstance is not relevant in this case. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, has held \na security clearance for several years, and has been steadily employed since 1998. He \nis the sole breadwinner in his family. Despite some economic stability, Applicant has \nfailed to satisfy over $18,988 in delinquent debts, several of which are for relatively \nsmall amounts of money. The record does not reflect that he has sought consumer \ncredit counseling or contacted his creditors to arrange settlement or payment of his \ndebts. His failure to satisfy his creditors raises security concerns about his judgment \nand reliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  Applicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after \nthe date that this decision becomes final. If he wishes, he can produce new evidence \nthat addresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  - 1. k.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 20, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On August 20, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nIn addition to presenting new evidence, Applicant\u2019s appeal submission is difficult to follow.  Applicant presents\n1\na document which he proffers as a re-creation of his response to the FORM (No response to the FORM was received by\nDOHA).  The document discusses nine debts.  For one debt, of more than $10,000, Applicant reports having made three\nor four monthly payments of $225 in 2008 and then having stopped making payments.  He then says, \u201cI do not have any\ncurrent information regarding this debt.  Currents status \u2013 Debt is paid in full.\u201d  Similarly, for the other eight debts he\nsays that no action has been taken to resolve the debts pending his divorce.  Nonetheless, for six of the eight debts he\nthen says \u201cCurrent status \u2013 Debt is paid in full.\u201d \n2\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a help-desk technician\nworking for a government contractor.  He has held a security clearance since 1998.\nApplicant has eleven delinquent debts, totaling $18,988.  Although he claimed to have paid\noff some of his debts, he provided no documentation in corroboration.  \u201cNothing in the record\nestablishes that Applicant has sought and received consumer credit counseling.\u201d  Decision at 3.

Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated response. He did not state whether \nhe wanted a hearing before an administrative judge or the case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. The case was scheduled for a hearing, during which \nApplicant specifically stated that he wanted a hearing. The case was assigned to me on \nApril 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nFebruary 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 26, 2009, and the \nhearing was convened as scheduled on March 18, 2009. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were received without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 26, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since March 2008. He attended college for a period but did not \nobtain a degree. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 1984 to 1995, and the National \nGuard from 1995 to 1998. He has honorably discharged from the Army and National \nGuard. He was married from 1996 until his divorce in 2002. He married again in 2008. \nHe has one adult child and two stepchildren; one stepchild is an adult and the other is a \nminor that lives with Applicant and his wife.1  \n \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife separated in about January 2002. He was able to \nmaintain his bills until February 2002, when he lost his job. He was unemployed for \nabout three to four months. When he obtained a job, it was at a salary much lower than \nhis previous job. His divorce was final in May 2002. The divorce decree ordered that \nApplicant was responsible for all joint debts. He was able to lower the monthly \npayments on his credit cards, but the institutions that owned his mortgage and car loans \nwould not lower their monthly payments. He was unable to maintain the payments on \nhis debts and they became delinquent.2   \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2003. His bankruptcy plan \nwas confirmed in April 2004. His plan called for him to pay about $640 per month to the \ntrustee to be disbursed to his creditors. He maintained the payments until about March \n2007, when he again lost his job. He was unemployed for about six months. The \nbankruptcy was dismissed in July 2007. The trustee\u2019s final report showed that Applicant \npaid the trustee $25,213. Of that amount, $21,175 went to his creditors; $1,750 was \npaid to his bankruptcy attorney; and the trustee received $2,288. Most of the payments \nwent to his secured debts. The trustee paid $6,968 to the holder of one car loan, leaving \na balance due of $6,512. An additional $13,517 was paid to the holder of another car \nloan, leaving a balance due of $13,000. The trustee paid $690 to a creditor on an \nunsecured debt, paying the debt in full.3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 20-26, 45; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 17-18, 29, 44; GE 4. \n \n3 Tr. at 18, 32-33, 45; GE 1-6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f.(3) and 1.f.(4) allege debts of $1,689 and $4,822 to the holder of one \nof the car loans that was included in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. The trustee divided the \nloan into the amount that was secured by the value of car and the amount that was \nunsecured because the loan was for greater than the car was worth. The amount of the \nloan was $12,227 when he filed bankruptcy. The trustee paid $5,796 toward the \nprincipal on this loan and $1,171 in interest, for a total of $6,968. The remaining amount \nof the loan that was secured by the value of the car after the bankruptcy payments was \n$1,689; and $4,822 was the remaining unsecured amount of the loan. The car was \nvoluntarily repossessed in about July 2007. There is no indication of what, if anything, \nApplicant owes as a deficiency after the vehicle was sold or auctioned.4  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f.(6) and 1.f.(7) allege debts of $2,998 and $10,002 to the holder of the \nother car loan that was included in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. The amount of the loan was \n$25,467 when he filed bankruptcy. The trustee paid $12,514 toward the principal on this \nloan and $1,003 in interest, for a total of $13,517. The remaining amount of the loan that \nwas secured by the value of the car after the bankruptcy payments was $2,998; and \n$10,002 was the remaining unsecured amount of the loan. The car was voluntarily \nrepossessed in about July or August 2007. Applicant indicated that the creditor reported \nto him that the deficiency owed on the car loan after the car was sold at auction was \n$8,000. He has made no payments on this debt.5   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 plan included three additional unsecured debts for credit \ncards, totaling $16,414. No payments to these three debts were made in the bankruptcy \nplan. Applicant has made no payments on any of the three debts since the bankruptcy \nwas dismissed. The three debts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f.(1), 1.f.(2), and 1.f.(5). The \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are duplicates of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f.(1) and 1.f.(2).6 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent medical debt of $100 which is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. The debt is listed on a credit report obtained on June 23, 2008. The name of \nthe medical provider is not included in the credit report. Applicant testified that the debt \nwas supposed to be covered by his medical insurance from his former employer. He \nindicated that he spoke with the hospital and was told that the medical claim would be \nre-filed with his insurance carrier.7  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege debts of $327 and $257 to a collection company on \nbehalf of a cellular telephone services company. The debts are listed on the June 23, \n2008 credit report. Applicant denied owing the debts. He stated that he had a business \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 35-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-6.  \n \n5 Tr. at 36-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-6.  \n \n6 Tr. at 26-29, 33-36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-6.  \n \n7 Tr. at 29-30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nphone at his previous job. When he left the job, the phone was supposed to be turned \noff. He received a bill from the company and has been disputing it since.8   \n \n \nApplicant owes the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2002 and 2006. He \nstated that he made mistakes on the returns for those years which led to him owing \nadditional taxes. He has been paying $200 per month to the IRS since about February \n2008. He reported the balance of the debt in August 2008 as $4,761. The IRS withheld \n$1,104 from his income tax refund in February or early March 2009. The IRS reported \non March 4, 2009, after the $1,104 was withheld, that Applicant owed $2,401 for the two \ntax years.9  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in February 2008. His \nfinances and bankruptcy were discussed. He told the investigator that he had not \nreceived any demand letters from the creditors after the bankruptcy was dismissed. He \nstated that he was waiting for the creditors to call and he would then make payment \narrangements. He also discussed the possibility that the Chapter 13 could be reinstated. \nApplicant\u2019s current plan is to pay the IRS first because the IRS has levied penalties and \ninterest, and seized his income tax refunds. He will then begin addressing his remaining \ndelinquent debts. He has not received financial counseling.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 30-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4.  \n \n9 Tr. at 19-20, 41, 45-47; GE 4; AE A, B. The IRS debts were not alleged as a basis for the denial \nof Applicant\u2019s security clearance in the SOR and will not be used for disqualification purposes. The debts \nand Applicant\u2019s payment of the debts will be used in assessing Applicant\u2019s total financial picture; in the \napplication of mitigating conditions; and in evaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n10 Tr. at 19-20, 45; GE 3, 4.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes a number of the debts alleged in the SOR. His financial \nissues are ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. His financial problems are directly \nattributable to a separation, divorce, and two periods of unemployment. These qualify \nas conditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also \nrequires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant acted \nresponsibly for a period by filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2003, and maintaining the \nplan\u2019s payments for several years. He was unable to continue making the payments \nbecause of his second period of unemployment, and the bankruptcy was dismissed. \nApplicant has worked for his current employer since March 2008. He has not made any \npayments on the debts included in the bankruptcy since it was dismissed. He has been \npaying his IRS debt first because his tax debts are incurring interest and penalties, and \nthe IRS withholds his income tax refunds. Applicant is acting somewhat responsibly by \npaying his IRS debt. However, the IRS has much stronger enforcement mechanisms \nthan the other creditors. I am unable to conclude that the IRS payments are a sincere \n\n \n7 \n \nacceptance of all his financial responsibilities, rather than a concession that the tax \ndebts will not go away and will ultimately have to be paid. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \napplicable. I further find that his IRS payments constitute a good-faith effort to repay the \nIRS debts, but are insufficient for Applicant to receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) as \na good-faith effort to repay all his overdue creditors. \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. I am unable to find clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) is applicable. \n \n \nApplicant disputed owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e, and \nsubmitted evidence through his testimony of his actions to resolve those debts. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is applicable to those debts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is 46 \nyears old. He served in the Army for eleven years and the National Guard for another \nthree years, and was honorably discharged from both. He separated, divorced, and lost \nhis job all within a short period in 2002. He filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy and maintained \nthe payments for several years until he again lost his job and the bankruptcy was \ndismissed. He paid the trustee $25,213 during the payment plan. Most of that amount \nwent to pay his two car loans, his bankruptcy attorney, and the trustee. Only $690 was \npaid to creditors holding unsecured debts. As such, when the bankruptcy was \ndismissed, Applicant still owed $16,414 on three unsecured credit card debts, and \n$19,512 on the two car loans. Both cars were involuntarily repossessed, leaving a \n\n \n8 \n \ndeficiency of about $8,000 on one car loan. The deficiency amount, if any, on the \nsecond car loan is unknown. Applicant has not made any payments on the debts in his \nbankruptcy plan since it was dismissed. He also owes the IRS for tax years 2002 and \n2006. He has been making $200 payments and the IRS has withheld his income tax \nrefunds, but he still owes $2,401. Applicant\u2019s payments to the IRS are a good start on \naddressing his delinquent debts, but are insufficient at this time to mitigate security \nconcerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Mendez, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 11 March 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF.  Applicant answered the SOR 2 May 2009, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned\n1\nthe case to me 29 May 2009, and I convened a hearing 9 July 2009. DOHA received\nthe transcript (Tr.) 17 July 2009.\n \nJuly 29, 2009\n\nHe also claimed, without corroboration, to have paid the debt at SOR 1.g. in April 2009, also after he received\n2\nthe SOR.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.f.\u2014a debt he claimed,\nwithout corroboration, to have paid in April 2009 after receiving the SOR.  He is a 27-\n2\nyear-old network field engineer employed by a defense contractor since March 2006.\nHe previously served in the U.S. Air Force, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant (pay-\ngrade E-5). He seeks to retain the clearance he transferred from the Air Force to his\ncontract employment.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits (GE 4, 5) confirm, seven delinquent\ndebts totaling nearly $24,000. Applicant denies only one debt, for $275. Applicant\nreported delinquent debts on his November 2007 clearance application (GE 1),\nconfirmed many of them during an interview with a government investigator in\nDecember 2007 (GE 3), and disclosed that he had taken no action to address any of the\ndebts in response to DOHA interrogatories in October 2008 (GE 2).\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are entirely attributable to his financial\nirresponsibility. While in the Air Force he would open credit accounts\u2014sometimes only\nto get the company discount for opening an account\u2014pay on them for a time, then stop\nmaking payments when something else came along that he wanted. There were no\noutside occurrences that contributed to his financial problems. Eventually, however, he\nwas unable to keep up with all his accounts. He made other choices that contributed to\nhis cash flow problems as well. As an enlisted member of the Air Force, he received a\nclothing allowance for his uniforms, and was eligible to live in government quarters and\neat in government dining facilities. In these circumstances, most of his pay was\navailable for purely personal expenses. He chose to forego these benefits and take the\nhousing and subsistence allowances provided by the government in lieu of messing and\nberthing\u2014allowances well known to be inadequate to cover the additional expenses of\nliving in the region where Applicant was stationed.\nAfter Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in October 2008, he\ncontacted some of his creditors, but took no action to actually resolve his debts until\nafter he received the SOR. Asked why he waited so long to contact his creditors,\nApplicant responded (Tr 35): \u201cYou could say it was procrastination. I\u2019m still quite\nirresponsible.\u201d Later asked why he made no payments to his creditors despite showing\npositive monthly cash flow of $580 in October 2008, he replied:\nIt's a good question. I don't have a great answer for it . . . I\nstill like to do fun things and go out, still be irresponsible, so I\ncould have been saving money and probably paying off\nthese debts a lot sooner, but I didn't. [Tr 45]\n\n3\nAlthough Applicant received dunning notices from his creditors, that did not\nmotivate him to address his debts. He planned simply to ignore his creditors (Tr 50). At\nhearing, he claimed to have paid the debt at SOR 1.d., but provided no corroboration. In\nApril 2009, (AE C, D) he established a payment program with a third-party credit firm to\naddress the debts at SOR 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e. The program obligates Applicant to pay\nabout $465 per month for 36 months to resolve those debts. However, for the first 18\nmonths of the program, administrative and maintenance fees consume more than half\nhis payment, leaving only about $223 for actual debt reduction. In mid-April 2009, he\nstarted a direct debit from his checking account to make the required monthly\npayments, but provided no documentation that he has actually made the payments. He\nhas a budget (AE B) that shows he has the means to make the program payments. He\nis still in negotiations with the creditor at SOR 1.a. about a repayment program. The\ncreditor wants a lump-sum payment \nApplicant\u2019s character and employment references consider him honest and\ntrustworthy, and recommend him for his clearance. They are all aware of his financial\nproblems. It is not clear whether they are aware of his financial irresponsibility.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . .  \n4\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n5\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n4\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He got heavily into debt through\nirresponsible living. He dealt irresponsibly with his creditors, ultimately intending not to\npay the amounts owed. Although he entered into a repayment program with a third-\nparty, and claimed without corroboration to have paid three small debts, he only acted\nonce his clearance was at risk. Further, his continuing lackadaisical attitude toward his\nfinances is demonstrated by selecting a credit adjustment firm that consumes more than\nhalf of his monthly payment in fees during the first 18 months of the program.4\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations offer Applicant little solace. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were not due to\n5\ncircumstances beyond his control and he did not act responsibly in addressing his\ndebts.  Had he acted responsibly in acquiring debt, he always had the means to pay his\n6\ncreditors until he opened more accounts than he could keep current.  Beyond the\nexpensive repayment program he entered, he has not sought credit counseling, and\nwhile the program will otherwise bring the greatest portion of the problem under control\nin 36 months,  that is not the real issue here. Applicant\u2019s dealings with his creditors is\n7\nthe antithesis of timeliness and good-faith.  His entire course of conduct is rife with the\n8\nkind of irresponsibility that makes him a poor risk for access to classified information. I\nconclude Guideline F against Applicant. Whole person analysis yields no different result.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-g:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

On January 13, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant,\nwhich detailed security concerns under Guideline F stating why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\n\nAllegation 1.e. states that the Applicant owes $36,854 to Key Bank.  I find that this alleged debt is actually\n1\na consolidated statement of the other student loans.\n2\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 9, 2009, and requested\na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non February 26, 2009. This case was assigned to another administrative judge on\nMarch 3, 2009. The case was reassigned to me on April 8, 2009.  DOHA issued  notices\nof hearing on April 7, 2009, and April 8, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nMay 18, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were\nreceived without objection. The Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E, also without objection. The record was left open at the\nApplicant\u2019s request for the submission of additional documentation. The Applicant\nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F on May 28, 2009. This exhibit was also received without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 27, 2009. The record\nclosed on May 28, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 29, single, and is six classes short of a bachelor\u2019s degree. The\nApplicant was laid off from his defense industry employer because the company lost\ntheir contract. He seeks a security clearance in connection with his prospective\nemployment in the defense industry. (Transcript at 7-10.) In his Answer to the SOR,\nApplicant admitted the allegations in Paragraph 1 of the SOR. Those admissions are\nhereby deemed findings of fact.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he\nin financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to obtain\nfunds.\n1.a. through 1.e.  The Applicant admits that he owes Key Bank the approximate\namount of $36,854 for a series of student loans.  The Applicant attended a university\n1\nfrom September 1997 to January 2000. He received financial aid from the university as\nwell as student loans from three different lenders. In 2000, he withdrew from school\nbecause he was unable to keep up his grades, which was required for him to retain his\nfinancial aid. Due to his failure to attend school his payment deferment ended until\napproximately 2007. The Applicant then began attending a junior college, and is taking\nenough credit hours to put his loans into deferment status again. (Transcript at 25-30,\n34-35; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \n\n3\nThe documentary evidence in the record shows that two of the three lenders\nhave put the Applicant\u2019s debts in a payment deferred status.  He worked for his defense\nindustry employer from January 2007 to March 2009. Because of that employment, he\nwas able to start making payments on his student loans, allowing them to go into\ndeferment status. (Transcript at 44-48, 50; Government Exhibit 2 at 5, Exhibit 3 at 2-5,\nExhibit 4, Exhibit 5, and Exhibit 6.)  The third lender sold its loans to a collection agency.\nThe Applicant is making regular payments to this collection agency per his agreement\nwith them. To date he has paid over $2,000 on his student loan debt.  (Transcript at 35,\n42-44, 48-52; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Exhibit F.)  \nThe Applicant\u2019s current financial status is stable, if strained because of his layoff.\nHe lives at home, where he rents a room from his parents. He budgets his money, and\nhas for several years. He states that he is not afraid of hard work, has done manual\nlabor in the past, and will continue to pay off his student loans. The most recent credit\nreport of the Applicant\u2019s shows he has no past due debt, other than the student loans.\n(Transcript at 36-38, 41; Government Exhibit 6.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant also presented recommendations from his general manager and\ntwo work leaders that are very laudatory. The letters describe the Applicant as \u201creliable,\nhonest, and trustworthy in every respect,\u201d \u201cdedicated,\u201d and \u201cconscientious, responsible.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, Exhibit C, and Exhibit D.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n4\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant has had financial difficulties (Guideline F). The Applicant, on\nthe other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\n\n5\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:     \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant failed to pay several of his student loans for a period\nof years.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(a) states that the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s debts are not the result of a spending spree or some other\naction that would show poor judgment.  He is back in school, on path to receive his\ndegree, and is paying off the one student loan that is not in deferment. The evidence\nraises this mitigating condition. \nEvidence that \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  As stated above,\nhis loans to two of the three student loan companies are in deferment.  He is making\nsatisfactory payments towards the third. I conclude this mitigating condition applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n6\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, in particular his allowing these debts\nto lie fallow for several years, his payments to the collection agency, and his return to\nschool on a basis that allows the other loans to go into a forbearance situation. Three of\nthe factors have the most impact on this case.  First, I find that there is the \u201cpresence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(6). The Applicant has shown that his failure to pay these loans was a\ntemporary situation that has been corrected. In addition, he is an overwhelmingly\ntruthful person. Under the particular facts of this case, there is little or no \u201cpotential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8). Finally, the\nevidence does not show a \u201clikelihood of continuation or recurrence\u201d of the conduct as\ndiscussed in AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance. Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Government Exhibit 4).  On November 25, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 10, 2009, in which\nshe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on March 27, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on March 31, 2009, and she submitted a reply on April 24, 2009.  The case was\nassigned to the undersigned for resolution on June 11, 2009. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n\n2\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 59 years old.  She is employed by a defense contractor and is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).

Since\nher most recent credit report, the Applicant has been working hard to resolve her debts.\nShe has contacted each of the creditors and has either paid off the debt in full or set up\na payment plan that she is following.  Her plans are to pay off her debts as soon as\npossible.  She has taken on a part time second job to be able to pay them off sooner,\nand she plans to incur no new debt.      \nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $250.00 has been paid in full.\n(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, Exhibit A).  A debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $4,751.00 is being paid on a monthly basis in the amount of $50.00 per\nmonth until the debt is paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, Exhibit B).

(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, Exhibit G).      \n\n3\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\n\n4\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n5\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant has made a good faith effort to resolve her past due\nindebtedness.  She has contacted each of the creditors and either paid off the debt or\nset up a payment plan to do so.  She has taken on additional employment in order to\npay them off sooner.  She does not plan on incurring any new debt.  The Government\nargues that the Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report also reflects an outstanding\njudgment for $39,119.00.  Although this debt is not listed in the SOR, I will assume that\nthe Applicant is also working to resolve it.  She understands the importance of paying\nher bills on time and living within her means.  Under the circumstances, she has made a\ngood faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is evidence of financial\nrehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that she can properly handle her\nfinancial affairs and that she is fiscally responsible.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for\nthe Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, candor, and a  willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, and it mitigates the negative\neffects of her financial indebtedness and the effects that it can have on her ability to\nsafeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has\novercome the Government's case opposing her request for a security clearance.\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.   \n\n6\n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Tr. 32) His \ngreat-grandfather\u2019s status resulted in the termination of his great-grandmother\u2019s job and \nhis grandfather being denied admission to several universities and being unable to have \na career in a managerial position. (Tr. 28)  \n2 \n\n \n \nIn 1982, Applicant enrolled at university taking civil construction engineering \ncourses. In 1983, he was expelled and drafted into the military during the Afghanistan \nwar. (Tr. 28) From 1983 through 1985, he was in tank repair before becoming a \ndraftsman due to his education. (Tr. 35, 47) In 1989, the Soviet Union opened up and \nApplicant came to the United States as a student attending a U.S university. (Tr. 29) \nThe American university paid for his initial education as part of the exchange program. \n(Tr. 46) Later, he paid for his education by working while attending school. (Tr. 46)  \n \n \nIn 1990, he returned to the Ukraine and finished his education. (Tr. 36) In 1991, \nthe Soviet Union broke up and Applicant left the country, but he went back in 1996, after \nhe had become a United States citizen, to defend his thesis. (Tr. 44) He obtained a \ncombined Master\u2019s degree and Bachelor\u2019s degree in Physics. (Tr. 36) While defending \nhis thesis and obtaining his degrees in the Ukraine, he was still attending a university in \nthe United States. (Tr. 44, 67) In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Mechanical \nEngineering from a U.S university. (Tr. 36)  \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was laid off from his job when the company shifted production \noverseas. (Tr. 49) Applicant was unemployed for nine months before returning to an \nAmerican university in the United States to work on his second Master\u2019s degree. (Tr. 49) \nIn 2005, he obtained his Master\u2019s degree in Electrical Engineering. (Tr. 36) \n \n \nAfter completing his education, Applicant decided to stay in the United States \nand not return to the Ukraine, because he liked living in a free society, free of tyranny \nand oppression. (Tr. 37) Applicant states the Ukraine is not a satellite of Russia. (Tr. 37) \nIt is a market democracy. (Tr. 39) In the 1990\u2019s, the Ukraine had the third largest \nnuclear arsenal in the world and chose to destroy it. (Tr. 38) The Ukraine was the most \nindustrialized republic when part of the Soviet Union. (Tr. 40) In 2008, following Russia\u2019s \ninvasion of Georgia, the Ukraine openly supported Georgia. (Tr. 67) \n \n \nApplicant visited the Ukraine in June 2001, July 2004, December 2006, January \n2007, August 2007, and Christmas time 2008. In 2001, he spent two to three weeks in \nthe Ukraine. In 2004, he was there for two months. In late 2005 and early 2006, \nApplicant was in the Ukraine for two to three weeks. In late 2006 and early 2007, \nApplicant spent two to three weeks in the Ukraine. (Ex. 3) In August 2007, he was there \nthree weeks. (Ex. 3) His last trip was for two weeks at Christmas time 2008. (Tr. 33) All \nof his trips were to visit his family. Applicant asserts that loyalty to his family does not \ntranslate into loyalty to the Ukrainian government. (Tr. 32)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, age 67, is a citizen and resident of the Ukraine. (Tr. 52) In \n1981 or 1982, his parents divorced. (Tr. 57) From 1981 until the summer of 2009, she \nwas a college chemistry professor at a state-funded Ukrainian college. (Tr. 31, 52) \nApplicant\u2019s mother was ineligible for a career above her teaching level because of her \ngrandfather. (Tr. 28) Applicant has telephone communication with his mother from two \nor three times a week to everyday. (Ex. 3, Tr. 33) Applicant sees his mother when he \nvisits the Ukraine. In July 2006, Applicant\u2019s petition for his mother to obtain a United \nStates visa was approved. (Ex. B)  \n \n3 \n\n \nIn March 2009, his mother was issued an immigrant visa by the United States \n(Ex. 2, D, Tr. 51, 58) She did not use it because of her deteriorating health. (Tr. 51) In \nJuly 2009, his mother had an operation and his brother remained to take care of her. \n(Tr. 30, 54) As of the time of the hearing, his mother had successfully undergone the \noperation, but was yet unable to travel. (33) Following the operation, Applicant talked to \nhis mother several times a day. (Tr. 34) \n \n \nApplicant has no relationship with his father, a retired science researcher, and \nhas not had any contact with him for more than ten years. (Ex. 2, 3) Applicant\u2019s brother, \nan insurance salesman, is a citizen and resident of the Ukraine. Applicant\u2019s contact with \nhis brother was between every two weeks to monthly contact and he saw him whenever \nhe traveled to the Ukraine. (Tr. 34) He last saw his brother in 2008, and last talked to \nhim six weeks before the hearing. (Tr. 55) In October 1998, Applicant\u2019s petition for his \nbrother to obtain a United States visa for was approved. (Ex. C)  \n \nUkraine \n \n \nThe Ukraine has a parliamentary\u2013presidential system of government with \nseparate executive, judicial, and legislative branches. It has been an independent state \nsince August 1991.2 (H Ex. I, p.3) In December 1991, the United States officially \nrecognized the independence of the Ukraine. The first post-Soviet constitution was \nadopted in June 1996. In March 2006, the Ukraine held parliamentary and local \nelections. (id., p.4) Following World War I, the Ukrainians declared independent \nstatehood. However, part was incorporated into Poland and part incorporated into the \nSoviet Union in 1922 as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  \n \n \nThe Ukraine is undergoing a significant economic, political, and social \ntransformation, and income disparities have grown sharply. (H. Ex. III, p.3) Freedom of \nreligion is guaranteed by law. (id., p.4, H Ex. II, p.13) Minority rights are respected. \nFreedom of speech and press are guaranteed and these rights are generally respected. \n(id.) The Ukraine does not recognize dual nationality. (H. Ex. III, p.5) \n \n \nThe Ukraine maintains peaceful and constructive relations with all its neighbors \nand has sought to maintain good relations with Russia. (H Ex. I, p.8) The United States \nattaches great importance to the success of the Ukraine\u2019s transition to a democratic \nstate with a flourishing market economy. (id., p.9) Ukraine\u2019s democratic \u201cOrange \nRevolution\u201d has led to closer cooperation and more open dialogue between the Ukraine \nand the United States. (id.) In March 2006, normal trade relation status was restored \nwith the termination of the Jackson-Vanik amendments to the Trade Act of 1974. (id.) \n \n \nUnited States policy remains centered on realizing and strengthening a \ndemocratic, prosperous, and secure Ukraine more closely integrated into Europe and \nEuro-Atlantic structures. In December 2008, the United States signed the United States \n\u2014Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership, which highlights the importance of the \nbilateral relationship and outlines enhanced cooperation in the areas of defense, \nsecurity, economics and trade, energy security, democracy, and cultural exchanges. \n                                                          \n2 The dissolution of the Soviet Union occurred In December 1991. (H Ex. I) \n4 \n\n(id.) The Charter also emphasizes the continued commitment of the United States to \nsupport enhanced engagement between NATO and the Ukraine. (id.) \n \n \nThe total United States assistance since independence has been more than $3.8 \nbillion. United States assistance is targeted to promote political, security, and economic \nreform and to address urgent social and humanitarian needs. The United States has \nconsistently encouraged Ukraine\u2019s transition to a democratic society with a prosperous \nmarket-based economy. (id.) \n \n \nFundamental civil and political rights are respected. (H Ex. II, p.1) The police and \npenal systems continue to be sources of some of the most serious human rights \nconcerns. (H Ex. II, p.1) They include instances of torture by law enforcement \npersonnel, harsh conditions in prisons, and arbitrary and lengthy pretrial detentions. (id.) \nThe judiciary lacks independence and suffers from corruption. (id.) Police corruption \nremains a problem. (id. p.8) Serious corruption persists in all branches of the \ngovernment. (id. p.1) \n \n \nLengthy pretrial detention remains a problem. Individuals often remain in \ndetention for months or years before being brought to trial. (id. p.8) The constitution \nincludes procedural provisions intended to ensure a fair trial, including the right of \nsuspects or witnesses to refuse to testify against themselves or their relatives; however, \nthese rights were limited by the absence of implementing legislation, which left a largely \nSoviet era criminal justice system in place. (H. Ex. II, p. 11) The constitution gives \ncitizens the right to challenge in court any decisions, actions, or omissions of national \nand local government officials that violates human rights. (id.p.12) \n \n \nThe Ukraine seeks to join NATO. (Tr. 67) In April 2008, the Bush Administration \nstrongly supported granting a Membership Action Plan to the Ukraine, a stepping-stone \nto NATO membership. (H. Ex. IV, summary, p.13) The effort was blocked. However, the \nAllies confirmed that the Ukraine will join NATO in the future. (id.) The Ukraine has also \nsought entry into the World Trade Organization and the European Union.    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n5 \n\n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in United States interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The two conditions applicable to this case are: \n6 \n\n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and brother are citizens and residents of the Ukraine. His \nparents are divorced and he has not had contact with his father in more than ten years. \nHe has frequent contact with his mother and less frequent contacts with his brother. His \nconnections to his family also create a potential conflict of interest because the \nrelationships are sufficiently close in nature and could raise a security concern over his \ndesire to help his mother and brother. Once Applicant became a United States citizen, \nhe sought to obtain a United States visa so his mother and brother could come to the \nUnited States. \n \nThe government presented sufficient evidence to support the factual allegations \nin the SOR. AG \u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \nFour of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nApplicant has professed his total loyalty to the United States. He has no financial \ninterest located in the Ukraine or in any other foreign country. It was Applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\ndecision to stay in the United States and not return to the Ukraine, because he likes \nliving in a free society, free of tyranny and oppression. \n \nBased on his relationship and depth of loyalty to the United States, Applicant can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of United States interests. He has \nlived in the United States since 1989, when he arrived to attend university. After earning \nan undergraduate and advanced degrees, he began working in the United States. In \n1996, he became a United States citizen. His ties to the Ukraine have become minimal \nover the years. He has no financial or property interests in the Ukraine. His \ncommunication with his brother is once every two to six weeks and with his father, non \nexistent. His communication with his mother is more frequent.  \n \n \nI have considered the information of which I have taken administrative notice \nconcerning the Ukraine. That information discloses that the Ukraine is a country that \nhas experienced a degree of political and economic instability since it gained \nindependence following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Ukraine is not a \nsatellite of Russia, but has a continuing complex relationship with Russia. The Ukraine \nhas sought entry into NATO, the World Trade Organization, and the European Union. \nThere is nothing to indicate the Ukraine has engaged in any espionage efforts, \neconomic or otherwise, since obtaining its independence.  \n \nAs to the potential for coercion, available information shows that the Ukraine is \nan open, market society, governed through a democratically elected legislature and \nexecutive, checked by an independent judiciary. It is not a hostile, totalitarian state \nseeking to project its power worldwide through the brute intimidation or coercion of its \ncitizens domestically and abroad. While there are notable problems regarding human \nrights abuses in the Ukraine, all of the available information shows Applicant=s mother \nand brother are not likely to be subject to coercive methods to obtain information from \nApplicant. I conclude there is little likelihood the Ukraine, a nation friendly toward the \nUnited States, will try to leverage Applicant=s relationship with his mother and brother to \ngain access to the information with which Applicant works.  \n \n \nNeither his mother, a retired university chemistry professor, nor his brother, an \ninsurance salesman, are in positions connected with the Ukrainian government or \nengaged in activities that would likely cause Applicant to be exploited or placed in a \nposition of having to choose between them and the United States. Considering all \navailable information about the Ukraine, Applicant is entitled to substantial consideration \nunder AG \u00b6 8(a). \n \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b) based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the United States. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of United States interests. He does not have any foreign financial or \nproperty interests. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies. He has frequent communication with mother and \nless frequent communication with his brother. He last talked with his brother six weeks \nbefore the hearing. Since leaving the Ukraine in 1989\u201420 years ago\u2014he has visited \nhis mother and brother in the Ukraine seven times.  \n \n8 \n\nApplicant has not had contact with his father in more than ten years. AG \u00b6 8(c) \napplies. Based on the foregoing, I conclude SOR & 1.a for the Applicant, and further \nconclude available information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised \nunder Guideline B. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nUnited States relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within \nthe United States; and many other [factors] raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). Substantial mitigating evidence weighs \ntoward granting Applicant a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is fully entrenched in the United States, has no foreign financial \ninterests, and is unlikely to compromise his life here. Applicant is a mature person. He \nhas lived in the United States for 20 years, most of his adulthood, and has been a \nnaturalized citizen for the past 13 years. He earned an undergraduate degree and an \nadvanced degree from United States institutions. He is a successful member of his \nbusiness community, providing services to the United States government and private \nindustry. His ties to the United States are much stronger than his ties to the Ukraine. \nThere is no evidence he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to \nthe United States. He takes his loyalty to the United States seriously, and he renounced \nhis Ukrainian citizenship after taking his United States oath of citizenship. The Ukraine \ndoes not recognize dual citizenship. There is no derogatory information about him in the \nrecord. \n \nA fair and commonsense assessment of the entire record before me shows the \ngovernment=s doubts about Applicant=s suitability to have access to classified \ninformation are based solely on his mother and brother being citizens and residences of \n9 \n\n10 \n                                                          \nthe Ukraine. They both have United States visas and would be living in the United \nStates now were it not for his mother\u2019s surgery followed by a period of being unable to \ntravel after the surgery. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and \nall facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.3 Available information is \nalso sufficient to resolve those doubts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign \ninfluence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:  FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:   \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n3 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions \narticulated under AG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person \nanalysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n \n",

The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuidelines B (Foreign Influence) and F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether \na clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. However, in a sworn, written \nstatement, dated November 26, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on February 5, 2009, and the case was assigned \nto me on February 6, 2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 5, 2009, and I \nconvened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 24, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, five Government exhibits and two Applicant exhibits were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was \nreceived on April 1, 2009. \n \nThe record was kept open until March 31, 2009, to enable Applicant to \nsupplement the record.  Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and, on that date, \nhe submitted both a facsimile of documents and an e-mail with attached documents \n(marked as Applicant Exhibits C and D, respectively) which were admitted without \nobjection. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take \nAdministrative Notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (hereinafter PRC), appearing in a written submission of the request.  Facts are \nproper for Administrative Notice when they are verifiable by an authorized source and \nrelevant and material to the case. In this instance, the source information relied upon by \nthe Government was publications of the Department of State;1 the Centre for \nCounterintelligence and Security Studies;2 the National Counterintelligence Center, now \n \n1 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Background Note: China, dated \nOctober 2008; U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, China (includes Tibet, \nHong Kong, and Macau) Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 2007, dated March 11, 2008; and U.S. \nDepartment of State, Consular Information Sheet: China \u2013 Country Specific Information, dated November 26, 2008. \n \n2 Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, Intelligence Threat \nHandbook, excerpts, dated June 2004. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nustice.   \n                                                          \nknown as the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive;3 and the U.S.-China \nEconomic and Security Review Commission.4 In addition, there were five press \nreleases from the U.S. Department of J\n5\n \nThe five press releases were presented apparently to substantiate that PRC \nactively pursues collection of U.S. economic and propriety information, and therefore, \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife and her family members in PRC raises suspicion of \nhim. None of the cases cited involves Applicant personally or involved espionage \nthrough any familial relationship. Likewise, none of the cases involves a native-born \nU.S. citizen merely married to a Chinese national. The criminal wrongdoing of other \nU.S. citizens is of decreased relevance to an assessment of Applicant\u2019s security \nsuitability, especially where there is no evidence that Applicant, nor any member of his \nfamily, was ever involved in any aspect of the cited cases or ever targeted by any \nChinese intelligence official. Furthermore, these press releases are little more than self-\ncongratulatory public relations products issued by public relations offices, with the \ncollateral effect of scaring and deterring other criminals contemplating possible attacks \non our national security. \n \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, I take administrative \nnotice of the facts and events described in the various reports and U.S. Department of \nState publications. However, I reject any facts set forth in the press releases.6 Also, the \ninference that somehow Applicant and/or his family participated in criminal activity was \nnot argued during the hearing and is specifically rejected. Pursuant to Rule 201, Federal \nRules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below under \nthe China subsection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the following factual allegations in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., 2.a., and 2.c. through 2.g. of the SOR. He subsequently amended \n \n3 National Counterintelligence Center, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and \nIndustrial Espionage, FY 07, dated September 10, 2008. \n \n4 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2007 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China \nEconomic and Security Review Commission, dated November 2007. \n \n5 U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney, Central District of California, Press Release: Chinese Resident \nPleads Guilty to Having Export Controlled Thermal-Imaging Cameras Sent to China (Re: United States v.

His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nretain a SECRET security clearance. With the exception of one brief period in 2003, \nwhen his security clearance was suspended for reasons set forth below, he has held a \nsecurity clearance since 1993.7 He served on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps \nfrom June 1993 until March 1997, and with the U.S. Army from January 1998 until \nOctober 2003.8 He has been employed as an instructor, site lead, or task lead by the \nsame government contractor, or successor company, since October 2006.9 He was \nunemployed from July 2006 until October 2006.10 \n \nForeign Influence \n \nApplicant was born in the United States in 1975,11 of native-born U.S. citizens \nwho are non-Asians.12 In 2002,13 rather than 2003, as stated in his e-QIP,14 Applicant \nmarried a woman, now 31 years old, who was a citizen and resident of PRC.15 They \nmet in PRC while he was employed there in an official U.S. Government capacity.16 She \nmoved to the U.S. in September 2003, and currently has the status of legal resident \nalien, awaiting eligibility for U.S. citizenship.17 While residing in PRC, his wife was \nemployed as an accountant by a foreign (non-Chinese) company for about three years, \nand before that she was an actress.18  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 61-year-old father-in-law and 59-year-old mother-in-law are both \nChinese citizens and residents of PRC.19 They previously worked in retail clothing \n \n7 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated December 2, 2007), at 37. \n \n8 Id. at 26-27. \n \n9 Id. at 13-14; Tr. at 33-34. \n \n10 Id.

While in PRC, the cousin worked briefly as a janitor, but since his \narrival in Canada, he is a waiter in a restaurant.30 He has never been employed by the \nChinese Government.31 \n \nApplicant has been to PRC on four occasions, including the period when he was \nthere in an official U.S. Government capacity. All of his visits were in accordance with \napplicable military regulations, and with the appropriate required permission of U.S. \nauthorities.32 In March-April 2002, he spent 14 days in PRC for his wedding and \nhoneymoon.33 His next visit occurred in December 2002-January 2003, when he went \n \n20 Tr. at 41-42. \n \n21 Id. at 42. \n \n22 Id. at 40. \n \n23 Id. \n \n24 Id. at 43. \n \n25 Id. \n \n26 Id. \n \n27 Id. at 44. \n \n28 Id. at 43. \n \n29 Id. at 46. \n \n30 Id. at 47. \n \n31 Id. \n \n32 Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR, dated November 26, 2008, at 4. \n \n33 Tr. at 49. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nt the commencement of his relationship with the woman who eventually \nbecam\n                                                          \nsightseeing.34 His last visit was in September 2003, when he spent about seven days \nbefore accompanying his wife to the U.S.35 While he has no current plans of returning to \nPRC for a visit, he would like to eventually do so.36 \n  \nA\ne his wife, Applicant reported her name to the Regional Security Officer (RSO) \nresponsible for the safety and security of those individuals assigned to his U.S. \nGovernment Office.37 Because of Applicant\u2019s marriage to a citizen of PRC, in April \n2002, his command filed a Report of Unfavorable Information for Security Determination \n(DA Form 5248-R), and his collateral access (SECRET security clearance) was \nsuspended, \u201cpending further investigation of spouse.\u201d38 On January 22, 2003, his \ncommand recommended Applicant\u2019s security clearance be reinstated as soon as \npossible, citing AR 380-67, Personnel Security Program, ch. 8-102, para. b, subpara. \n(1):39 \n \nIf the commander determines that the person has been cleared of all \ncharges and that the alleged offense or disqualifying information has been \ndisproved or found groundless, and the commander is completely \nconvinced that no element of risk remains, the commander may restore \ninterim access in the name of the Commander, CCF.  \n \nOn February 25, 2003, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was granted by the U.S. Army \nCentral Personnel Security Clearance Facility (DA CCF).40  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s blood relations and heritage, as well as his wife, and all financial \ninterests are in the U.S. He has no financial interests in PRC, and owns no property \nthere. Furthermore, he has no blood relations in PRC, and his only continuing \nrelationships with any person in PRC are the infrequent, indirect relationships he has \nthrough his wife.41 \n \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  \n \nPRC has an authoritarian, Communist government, with powerful military forces, \nincluding strategic nuclear weapons and missiles.

It has significant resources, and an economy that in \nrecent years has expanded about 10% per year. In PRC, reported human rights \nproblems include suppression of political dissent, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced \nconfessions, torture and mistreatment of prisoners. The PRC also monitors telephone \nconversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and internet \ncommunications, and sometimes nonconsensual monitoring with listening devices and \nsurreptitious searching of hotel guestrooms.  \n \nPRC aggressively competes with the United States in many areas. It actively \ncollects military, economic and proprietary, industrial information about the United \nStates because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a global power; (2) its \nmilitary, political, and economic investments in the Pacific Rim and Asia; and (3) its \nleading role in development of advanced technology that PRC desires for economic \ngrowth. Americans of Chinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets by the \nPRC. Active intelligence gathering programs focus on sensitive and protected U.S. \ntechnologies. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have characterized \nPRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading threat to the security of \nU.S. technology. \n \nNevertheless, total two-way trade between PRC and the U.S. reached $386 \nbillion in 2007, with PRC becoming the third-largest trading partner for the U.S. While \nthere have been a number of incidents involving individuals, companies, and PRC \nintelligence officers improperly acquiring U.S. economic intelligence and proprietary \ninformation, there is no direct or indirect connection to, or involvement with, Applicant, \nhis wife, or his wife\u2019s family.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were generally unremarkable until about 2006. His employer \nat that time initially asked him to relocate to the opposite coast for business-related \nreasons, and he did so. Shortly thereafter, and after Applicant had purchased a \nresidence, he was asked to relocate once again back to the original location. When he \nindicated his unwillingness to relocate again, Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated.42 \nPrior to his termination, Applicant\u2019s Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score was 762,43 and \nhe was earning $68,000 per year with an annual bonus of $35,000, or a total amount of \n$103,000.44 He and two other individuals joined together to start their own company, but \nat that time, it did not generate any income for him.45 \n \n \n42 Tr. at 71-72. \n \n43 Id. at 59. \n \n44 Id. at 72. \n \n45 Id. at 73. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nWith no income from July 2006 until October 2006, and with no savings, \nApplicant was forced to rely on his credit cards for necessary expenses.46 He contacted \neach of his creditors to alert them of his status, but most of them declined to assist him \nbecause he had failed to take their respective \u201ccredit insurance.\u201d47 His lack of income \nmade it difficult for him to remain current with his normal monthly payments, and some \nof those accounts became delinquent. Some were sent to collection, and some were \n\u201ccharged off.\u201d While his house never entered foreclosure, his payments were in arrears, \nbut he eventually entered into a repayment plan with his mortgage holder, and by the \ntime of the hearing, he was only one month behind on his payments.48 He currently has \na tenant who rents the residence through a rental management company and that \nsituation generates about 50% of the actual monthly mortgage payment.49 He set up a \npayment plan by prioritizing his debts and discussing the implementation of payment \nplans with certain creditors with the ultimate goal of satisfying each creditor.50 \n \nThe SOR identified eight purportedly continuing outstanding financial obligations. \nThose allegations listed in the SOR, and their respective purported current status, \naccording to the credit reports, financial records and correspondence, as well as \nApplicant\u2019s comments regarding same, are described below: \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a.: In October 2007, Applicant notified the Veterans Administration (VA) \nof his intention to enroll in courses from an online university, and he obtained a letter of \neligibility. He submitted the appropriate paperwork to the school for reimbursement \ncoverage under the Montgomery GI Bill, but unfortunately for Applicant, the school \nfailed to properly process the paperwork.51 At the same time, he also applied for a loan \ndirectly from the school. The unpaid tuition debt, totaling $2,955, was sent to \ncollection.52 Applicant never received any calls from the creditor, and while he was \naware the account was delinquent,53 he was unaware it was in collection until he \nreceived the SOR in November 2008.54 He immediately contacted the school and urged \nthem to rectify the situation by properly filing the paperwork and asked them to remove \nthe derogatory information from his credit report.55 Applicant has not yet received any \npayments from the VA and has received no further status information from the school. \n \n46 Id. at 74. \n \n47 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 7, at 42; Id. at 67-68. \n \n48 Id. at 75. \n \n49 Id. \n \n50 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 7, at 42. \n \n51 Tr. at 53-56. \n \n52 Government Exhibit 4 (Combined Credit Report, dated December 14, 2007), at 10. \n \n53 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 7, at 39. \n \n54 Tr. at 55. \n \n55 Id. at 54-55. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b.: In about May 2006, when Applicant relocated his residence to the \nother coast, he notified the pet hospital to cancel his pet insurance.56 Unbeknownst to \nhim, instead of cancelling the insurance, the creditor either erroneously set it up to not \nrenew,57 or caused it to automatically renew.58 The creditor was unable to contact \nApplicant at his old address,59 and the account, with an unpaid balance of $168, \nbecame delinquent, and was sent to collection.60 When Applicant became aware of the \ndelinquency, he contacted the creditor who corrected the account. On November 20, \n2008, Applicant satisfied the account with a payment of $139.75.61 \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c.: Because of his unemployment status in 2006, Applicant found it \nincreasingly difficult to remain current on his monthly payments for his American \nExpress Credit Card. As a result, the account was eventually closed by the creditor and \nsent to collection62 with an unpaid balance of over $5,000.63 On July 17, 2007, well \nbefore the issuance of the SOR, Applicant and the creditor agreed to a payment plan \nunder which Applicant would make $200 monthly payments until the account is \nsatisfied.64 He has complied with that agreement since that time,65 and the account is \nnearly paid off.66 \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d.: Applicant also found it increasingly difficult to remain current on his \nmonthly payments for his Chase Credit Card.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d94 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.95  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d96 \n \n93 Exec.

It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nReciprocity - National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual  \n \n \nThe following reciprocity provisions are set forth under \u00a7 2-204, National \nIndustrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), otherwise identified as \nDepartment of Defense Manual 5220.22-M, dated February 28, 2006:  \nFederal agencies that grant access to classified information to their \nemployees or their contractor employees are responsible for determining \nwhether such employees are responsible for determining whether such \nemployees have been previously cleared or investigated by the Federal \nGovernment. Any previously granted PCL that is based upon a current \ninvestigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the \nclearance required shall provide the basis for issuance of a new clearance \nwithout further investigation or adjudication unless significant derogatory \ninformation that was not previously adjudicated becomes known to the \ngranting agency.  \nFurthermore, under the ch. 4, \u00a7 C4.1.2., the Regulation, the following applies: \nAs long as there is no break in Military Service and/or Federal \nemployment greater than 24 months, any previous personnel security \ninvestigation that essentially is equivalent in scope to an investigation \nrequired by this Regulation will be accepted without requesting additional \ninvestigation.  \n \nIn this instance, while there was an ENAC conducted in 1998, upon which \nApplicant was initially granted a SECRET security clearance, and his security clearance \nwas suspended in 2002, pending further investigation, due to his marriage to a citizen of \nPRC, that security clearance was subsequently reinstated by DA CCF in 2003, \napparently based on the results of the investigation. But for those provisions in the \n \n \n97 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nNISPOM and the Regulation, DOHA might have been bound to grant reciprocity to the \nDA CCF adjudication, pertaining to the Foreign Influence issue. \nHowever, two factors have intervened. First, there was a break in Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service and or federal employment of greater than 24 months.  He was \nemployed by a company not a federal contractor from October 2003 until July 2006. \nSecond, significant derogatory information pertaining to financial considerations that \nwere not previously adjudicated became known to the granting agency. Thus, \nNISPOM\u2019s reciprocity provision does not preclude a reevaluation of Applicant\u2019s security \neligibility. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.98 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 7(b), Aconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation@ may raise security concerns. Also, AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a \nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may raise \n \n98 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nsecurity concerns as well. The evidence is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and \n7(d).  However, the security significance of these identified conditions requires further \nexamination of Applicant\u2019s respective relationships with his wife\u2019s parents who are \ncitizen-residents of PRC and her cousin who is a PRC-citizen/Canadian-resident, to \ndetermine the degree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The complicated, \ncompetitive relationship of PRC with the U.S. places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship \nwith his wife\u2019s parents in PRC, as well as her cousin in Canada, does not pose a \nsecurity risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and his wife\u2019s family members.99  \nWith its mixed human rights record, and other political, economic and military \nrivalry with the U.S., it is not inconceivable that PRC would target any citizen in an \nattempt to gather valuable information from the United States. On the other hand, there \nare some indications that the position of the U.S. is not as inflexible towards PRC as \nmight be initially surmised. In 2000, despite the purported concerns over PRC\u2019s \ncontinuing intelligence gathering, the U.S. permanently extended the most-favored-\nnation status provision to PRC-U.S. commercial treaties binding the signatories to \nextend trading benefits equal to those accorded any third state. Furthermore, while \n \n99 The Appeal Board has articulated a \u201cheightened risk\u201d or \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d because of the PRC\u2019s \nhostility to the United States. ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard and reversing grant of clearance in case involving family members living in the PRC). For example in ISCR \nCase No. 07-02485 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008), the Appeal Board stated, \u201cGiven the PRC\u2019s interest in U.S. \nintelligence, Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives pose a real, rather than merely theoretical, risk that Applicant could be \ntargeted for manipulation or induced into compromising classified information.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. May 9, 2008) the Appeal Board described what facts supported reversal of the Administrative Judge\u2019s \ndecision to grant that Applicant with connections to PRC a clearance: \n  \nThe fact that Applicant lives with a PRC citizen, her husband; that her husband maintains contact \nwith his own father who is a citizen and resident of the PRC; that Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and \nresident of the PRC; that Applicant speaks with her brother over the telephone \u201cseveral times a \nyear;\u201d that the PRC targets U.S. citizens of PRC ancestry for intelligence gathering purposes; and \nthat the PRC monitors telephone and other communications of its citizens constitute significant \nrecord evidence of security significant foreign contacts and interest. As such, Applicant\u2019s evidence \nas to her good job performance and her ties to the U.S. are not sufficient to mitigate those \nconcerns. It is not to question Applicant\u2019s patriotism to acknowledge that the record in her case \nraises the reasonable concern that she could be placed in a position of having to choose between \nher ties to the U.S. and her obligations to her foreign family members. The evidence which \nApplicant has provided is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. The Board \nholds that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable on this record. \n  \nSee also ADP Case No. 05-17812 (App. Bd. June 11, 2007); ISCR Case No. 05-10467 (App. Bd. May 8, 2007) (both \nreversing favorable clearance decisions for PRC-related Applicants); ISCR Case No. 06-23453 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 06-21622 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007) (both remanding favorable clearance decisions for PRC-\nrelated Applicants).   \n \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nthere is the \u201cheightened risk\u201d standard, the U.S. Government has not established a \u201cper \nse\u201d rule against granting a security clearance to an individual with family members who \nare PRC citizen/residents, and there is no general prohibition regarding casual or \npersonal travel to the PRC by U.S. citizens who possess a security clearance. \nThere is evidence that PRC intelligence operatives seek classified or economic \ninformation from U.S. businesses and/or government agencies, Applicant\u2019s very rare, \nindirect connections to his mother-in-law, his father-in-law and his wife\u2019s cousin, as well \nas his wife\u2019s frequent communications with her parents, create a potential conflict of \ninterest because these relationships are conceivably close enough to raise a security \nconcern about his desire to help his wife\u2019s relatives living in the PRC and Canada by \nproviding sensitive or classified information.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.@ Similarly, AG \u00b6 8(b) may \napply where the evidence shows Athere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.@ Also, AG \u00b6 8(c) may apply where \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  In addition, \nwhen \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding \nthe reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations \nfrom a foreign country,\u201d AG \u00b6 8(e) may apply. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife\u2019s various family members is diverse. His \nwife\u2019s parents, both PRC citizen-residents, require the most scrutiny. His relationship \nwith them is, for the most part, non-existent, for aside from relatively brief visits to PRC, \nthe last of which occurred six years ago when he accompanied his wife to the U.S., he \nhas little if any direct contact with them. His only continuing contacts are rare and \nindirect, through his wife. While her relationship with her parents can be deemed close, \nthat relationship still carries over to Applicant under AG \u00b6 7(d). As far as Applicant is \nconcerned, the contacts and relationships are casual and infrequent. The relationship \nhe has with his wife\u2019s cousin, a PRC citizen-Canadian resident, to the extent there is \none, appears to be even more distant. While his wife and her cousin do continue to \nhave diminishing periodic contact, even those activities do not demonstrate a really \nwarm, close relationship.  \n \nThere is no evidence that these relatives have been political activists, challenging \nthe policies of the PRC Government. There is no evidence these relatives currently \nwork for or have ever worked for the PRC Government, military, or intelligence service. \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nLikewise, there is no evidence that terrorists or the PRC Government have approached \nor threatened Applicant or his wife\u2019s relatives for any reason. And, there is no evidence \nthat Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents in PRC currently engage in activities which would bring \nattention to them or that they or other PRC elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s \nwork. As such, there is a reduced possibility that these relatives would be targets for \ncoercion or exploitation.100 \n \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant\u2019s \nrelatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant \nfactors, including the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the \nrealistic potential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the \nforeign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the \ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is \nlimited to countries that are hostile to the United States.101 In fact, the Appeal Board has \ncautioned against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations \nand \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d102 Nevertheless, the \nrelationship between a foreign government and the U.S. may be relevant in determining \nwhether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely to attempt to exploit a \nresident or citizen to take action against the U.S. through the Applicant.  It is reasonable \nto presume that a contentious relationship, or the absence of a democratic government, \nis not determinative, but it may make it more likely that a foreign government would \nattempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates in that foreign country. \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s extremely limited contacts with his wife\u2019s parents and \ncousin, it is unlikely he would be placed in a position of having to choose between their \ninterests and the interests of the U.S. His infrequent, indirect contacts and rather distant \nrelationship with these relatives have a low potential of forcing him to choose between \nthe United States and the PRC. He met his burden of showing there is little likelihood \nthat his relationships with these relatives could create a risk for foreign influence or \n \n100 The Appeal Board has ruled that in the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal error to give \nsignificant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States (ISCR Case No. 02-\n13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a foreign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 \nlow-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the foreign government has not contacted them about \nApplicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be \nsufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile \nhealth (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. \nBd. Feb. 12, 2003), financial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of \nfinancial  dependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of any \nconnection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. \nJan. 21, 2005)); and a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its stable, democratic government, or its \nextensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, \n2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many of these factors are pertinent to the \nanalysis in this case under the whole person concept.  \n \n101 See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. \n10, 2002). \n102 ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \nexploitation. His contacts and communications, to the extent there are any, with these \nrelatives are so casual and infrequent as to not create a risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.  While there may be speculation as to \u201csome risk\u201d about his relationship \nwith his in-laws living in the PRC, that speculation, in the abstract, does not, without \nsubstantially more, establish evidence of a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nHis relationship with his spouse, a PRC citizen-U.S. resident, is obviously much \ncloser. Nevertheless, while she currently retains her PRC citizenship, she intends to \nrenounce it in favor of U.S. citizenship when she it eligible. She does not hold a job \noutside the family home, but is a fulltime homemaker.  Nevertheless, there is a \nheightened risk resulting from her relationship with her parents living in the PRC. For \nexample, the PRC Government could take her parents\u2019 pensions to attempt to coerce \nher to pressure Applicant. \n \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with the United States weighs against a security \nconcern for these relationships. He is a native-born American, not of Asian ancestry, \nwho simply fell in love and married a citizen of PRC. Applicant has such deep and \nlongstanding family, military, financial, and employment relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nHis parents and blood-relatives are U.S. citizens, and all reside in the United States. His \nwife and he have resided together in the U.S. since 2003, and he has resided here his \nentire life, with the exception of the period during which he was serving with the U.S. \nGovernment in PRC. His values are U.S. values, and his wife is now in the process of \nmaking them her values as well as she approaches U.S. naturalization. He served \nhonorably with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, and worked for government \ncontractors, all the while holding a SECRET security clearance. \n \nAs noted above, at the commencement of his relationship with the woman who \neventually became his wife, Applicant reported the relationship to the appropriate RSO. \nFollowing his wedding, his SECRET security clearance was suspended, \u201cpending \nfurther investigation of spouse.\u201d His command recommended the security clearance be \nreinstated as soon as possible, and on February 25, 2003, Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance was granted by the DA CCF. In self-reporting his relationship, he promptly \ncomplied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, \nrequests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country. In \nthis instance, the issue was merely a contact, and nothing more sinister. There is no \nreason to speculate as to possible contrary actions in the future. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(c), \nand 8(e) partially apply in this case, and AG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n19 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns as well. As noted above, with the exception of a period from July \n2006 until October 2006, when he was terminated, Applicant has been gainfully \nemployed since 1997. During his period of unemployment, he was forced to rely on his \ncredit cards for necessary expenses. His lack of income made it difficult for him to \nremain current with his normal monthly payments, and some of those accounts became \ndelinquent. Some were sent to collection, and some were \u201ccharged off.\u201d The evidence is \nsufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying \ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nWhen \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., the loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances\u201d is also potentially mitigating under AG & 20(b). \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is \npotentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@103 Also, AG & 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue\u201d may apply. \n \n \n103 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n20 \n                                      \n \nAs noted above, the normal overriding concern pertaining to financial \nconsiderations in the security clearance context is that \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. . . .\u201d \n(emphasis supplied).  To determine if an applicant is a person with poor self-control or \npossesses a lack of judgment, an analysis of the individual\u2019s original and continuing \nintentions and actions is essential. In this instance, since his 2006 period of \nunemployment, Applicant\u2019s financial history and actions reveals no evidence of poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. To \nthe contrary, his sole goal was to obtain employment and satisfy his financial \nobligations. His efforts were responsible and disciplined.  He immediately contacted \neach of his creditors to alert them of his status, but most of them declined to work with \nhim. When he was able to do so, as early as mid-2007, well before the SOR was \nissued, he entered into repayment plans with creditors, avoided foreclosure on his \nresidence, and paid off his first delinquent account. Several other repayment plans were \nlikewise initiated, and additional accounts are either fully paid off, or will be shortly. The \nremaining accounts have either been corrected or are in the process of being \naddressed.   \n \nConsidering the unusual circumstances of today\u2019s economy in general, and the \nseries of events involving Applicant\u2019s financial obligations in particular, Applicant\u2019s \nactions and his otherwise good financial status, there are clear indications that \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues have been resolved and are now largely under control.  The \nevidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e), because the \ncircumstances are unusual and unlikely to recur, and do not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n21 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a native-born American, \nnot of Asian ancestry, who simply fell in love and married a citizen of PRC. He has such \ndeep and longstanding family, military, financial, and employment relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. His parents and blood-relatives are U.S. citizens, and all reside in the \nUnited States. His wife and he have resided together in the U.S. since 2003, and he has \nresided here his entire life, with the exception of the period during which he was serving \non behalf of the U.S. Government in PRC. His values are U.S. values, and his wife is \nnow in the process of making them her values as well, as she approaches U.S. \nnaturalization. He served honorably with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, and \nworked for U.S. Government contractors, all the while holding a SECRET security \nclearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:104 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c . . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nApplicant became unemployed and his debts became delinquent. There is, \nhowever, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has established a \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d of debt payments by actually paying some of his delinquent SOR debts, \nsetting up arrangements with other remaining creditors, and setting up his personal plan \nto resolve his remaining debts. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and \nmitigation. \n \n \n104 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n\n \n22 \n                                      \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder the guidelines for foreign influence and financial considerations.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He claimed to\nhave repaid one, documented no resolution concerning the other six, and provided\ninsufficient evidence to mitigate resulting security concerns. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on January 18, 2008. On January 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n1\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nJuly 9, 2009\n\nItem 4.\n2\nThe Government submitted eight items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 5.\n4\nItem 4.\n5\nItem 6.\n6\nItem 6 at 10; Item 7 at 1. \n7\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 27, 2009, and requested that\nhis case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on March 30, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n3\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant signed\nthe document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM on April 9, 2009, and\nreturned it to DOHA. He did not submit any additional information, and made no\nobjection to consideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel, during\nthe 30-day response period. I received the case assignment on June 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married, with\ntwo children ages 25 and 21. He has been employed in his present capacity as a senior\nsoftware engineer since July 2007. He has no military service, and has never held a\nsecurity clearance.  In his response to the SOR, he admitted the truth of all the factual\n4\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g, with some explanations, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.a\nwith an explanation that the debt in question had been resolved after the date alleged.5\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his response to DOHA\ninterrogatories,  are incorporated in the following findings.\n6\nThe six delinquent debts to which Applicant admitted in his SOR response totaled\n$49,286. These debts are for various credit card accounts. Applicant provided no proof\nof any payment toward, or agreement to repay any of these debts. On July 16, 2008,\nDOHA forwarded financial interrogatories to Applicant, asking him to document payment\nor the current status of his delinquent debts. In his August 14, 2008, response he\nsubmitted a copy of a letter from the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor agreeing to a repayment\nschedule of $131.91 per month from January 2008 through December 2008, during\nwhich finance charges would not be assessed. His September 25, 2008, credit bureau\nreport showed a remaining balance of $527 (as accurately alleged in the SOR), thus\ncorroborating that he made the first eight payments as agreed. He claimed in his SOR\nresponse that this debt was repaid in full in December 2008, but provided no proof of\nfurther payments.7\n\nItem 5 at 10-17.\n8\nItem 6 at 5.\n9\nId.\n10\nItem 5 at 28-30.\n11\nItem 6 at 7-8.\n12\n3\nApplicant worked for one large technology company from June 1995 to June\n2002, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from then until October 2003, when he\nbegan a series of four jobs with smaller organizations preceding his current job.8\nApplicant explained that:\n[During my 16 months of unemployment], I cashed in my [company]\npension, my 401k, [a company] severance check, and used a $25,000\ninheritance in order to keep my home. I was able to keep up on all my\ndebts until early 2003, when it became clear that all I could pay was my\nmortgages and utilities, or end up broke. During this time my wife and I\nconsulted with a bankruptcy lawyer, and talked with various \u201cCounseling\nServices.\u201d We decided rather than bail on our debts, that we would pay\nthese debts off on our own. From 2003 until late 2006, we did not have a\nsufficient income to consider paying down any of our debts. At that time,\nwith two kids in college, and our regular expenses we just didn\u2019t have\nenough income to address the bad debt. It wasn\u2019t until late 2006 that we\nhad an income that was sufficient to start the paybacks.    \n9\nAfter paying two non-SOR-listed debts, he entered the agreement described above to\nrepay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He claimed, again without corroboration, that his\nhome was worth $249,000 with first and second mortgage balances of $128,855 and\n$8,109. They considered borrowing further against this $112,000 in equity value, \u201cto pay\noff the entire slate of bad debts,\u201d but \u201cdelayed doing this to assess the needs of our\ndaughter\u2019s college expenses against our debt load.\u201d  He also provided no evidence that\n10\nany lender would refinance his mortgages considering his credit history and the current\nfinancial climate. In response to the e-QIP \u00a7 18 questions concerning foreign travel, he\nreported visiting Mexico, Grand Cayman Island, and Jamaica during a May 2007\npleasure cruise.11\nApplicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement indicated monthly net income of\n$7,295, with expenses and debt payments of $6,585, leaving $710 as a monthly net\nremainder. He claimed $152,500 in assets.  Applicant offered no evidence of credit or\n12\nfinancial counseling except the above-quoted remark. He offered no other evidence\nconcerning his character, trustworthiness or responsibility. I was unable to evaluate his\ncredibility, demeanor or character in person since he elected to have his case decided\nwithout a hearing. \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  AG \u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d are potentially disqualifying. Department Counsel cited\nonly the former condition in her argument, but both are supported on this record.\nApplicant admitted extensive spending through use of credit he knew he could not repay\nfrom early 2003 to late 2006. Once his inability to repay any debt ended, he\ndemonstrated unwillingness to do so in a responsible manner. He did repay one\ndelinquency at the rate of $132 per month, but did not apply any of his monthly $711\nremainder toward other debts. Even if all this combined available $843 were dedicated\nto addressing his delinquent debt, it would take almost five years to resolve all of it. The\nevidence supporting these disqualifying conditions requires a closer examination and\nbalancing of resulting security concerns with any potentially mitigating matters, and\nshifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nirresponsibility is recent, involves six different creditors, and continues to date. He\nremains substantially in debt and his current financial situation precludes a finding that\ndelinquent indebtedness is unlikely to recur. The evidence does not support application\nof this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant did suffer\nabout 16 months of unemployment during 2002 and 2003. However, he did not\ndemonstrate that he responsibly reduced non-essential spending in reaction to it. The\nevidence indicates that Applicant chose to continue an affluent lifestyle by borrowing\nmoney on credit he knew he could not repay. Even after regaining month-to-month\n\n6\nsolvency, he chose to take a Carribean pleasure cruise in May 2007 rather than\naddress his obligations to those who had extended him that credit. Applicant has not\nestablished mitigation of any of his debts, or of his financial history as a whole under\nthis provision.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d There is no evidence of financial counseling, nor of any\nsubstantial efforts to resolve his delinquencies. The record is also devoid of evidence\nsupporting his ability to repay more than $49,000 in outstanding delinquent debts in the\nnext several years. Insufficient efforts have occurred to date to alleviate the substantial\nsecurity concerns raised by the length and degree of financial irresponsibility that\ncontinues to date. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for his choices and conduct. He presently has at least $49,000 in\ndelinquent debt, and did not meet his burden to prove an ongoing ability to repay it in a\ntimely manner. There is insufficient evidence to support a finding that such financial\nirresponsibility will not recur. His debts continue to create substantial potential for\npressure, coercion, or duress. The record contains insufficient other evidence about his\ncharacter or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or tending to make their\ncontinuation less likely. \n\n7\nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of not meeting\nhis financial obligations and inability to satisfy his current debts. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nTarek H. Zohdy, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 18, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 28, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision under\nGuideline F was contrary to the weight of the record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his\n\n\u201c[I]n-laws represent a class of persons who are contemplated by the Directive as presenting a potential security\n1\nrisk . . .

Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a linguist working for\na Defense contractor.  She was born, raised, and educated in Egypt.  \nApplicant first traveled to the U.S. in the late 1970s.  She and her husband immigrated to this\ncountry in the 1980s and became U.S. citizens in the early 1990s.  She has three siblings, two of\nwhom are citizens and residents of the U.S. and one of whom is a citizen and resident of Egypt.  She\ncontacts her Egyptian sibling approximately twice a month.  \nApplicant also has in-laws who are citizens and residents of Egypt.  In addition, her husband\nhas an uncle who, in his late teens, had belonged to a terrorist organization.  He is now a citizen and\nresident of the U.S. and teaches at a U.S. university.  Before becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband was an official in an Egyptian governmental organization.  \nApplicant and her siblings inherited a house and land in Egypt.  Applicant intends to\nrenounce her interest in the property.  She has traveled to Egypt in order to visit relatives and to\nsightsee.  \nApplicant has delinquent debts owed to a department store and to a utility company.\nAlthough she claims to have disputed these debts, she provided no corroboration.\nEgypt has an excellent relationship with the U.S. and receives substantial U.S. foreign aid.\nHowever, terrorist groups carry out attacks in Egypt, targeting U.S. interests.  \u201cTerrorist groups\nconduct intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.\u201d  Decision at 8.\nApplicant requests that the Board exercise de novo review over her appeal.

Jun. 21, 2010).  \nIn evaluating the Guideline F security concerns, the Judge noted that Applicant had paid off\na number of her debts or had reasonably disputed others.  However, as to the remaining ones cited\nin the SOR, his decision that she had failed to show diligence in attempting to resolve them is\nsupportable.  Concerning Guideline B, the extent of Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives, to include in-\nlaws,  supports the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\n1\nweighed the record evidence in an arbitrary or capricious manner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n21819 at 2 (App. Bd.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted or denied. \n \nOn August 24, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Applicant\u2019s attorney entered his appearance \non September 8, 2009, in a companion case. On September 9, 2009, I granted \nApplicant\u2019s counsel a delay to accommodate his schedule. The case was assigned to \nme on October 8, 2009, and with all parties\u2019 agreement, a joint hearing was scheduled. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 3, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on November 25, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 7. GE 1-5 were admitted without objection. Applicant objected to GE 6, \nand the document was not admitted. GE 7 was considered for administrative notice \npurposes only. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1A through 6A, \nwhich were admitted without objection. AE 7 was received on December 28, 2009, and \nadmitted over the Government\u2019s objections. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on December 9, 2009. The record was closed on December 28, 2009. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nAt Applicants\u2019 request, and with the Government\u2019s acquiescence, I conducted a \njoint hearing. The same attorney represented both Applicant and her spouse (ISCR \nCase No. 09-02708). \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested I take administrative notice of certain facts \nrelating to Egypt. The request and the attached documents were marked and included \nin the record as Government Exhibit (GE) 7 for identification. Applicant objected to my \nconsideration of GE 7. The documents were considered for administrative notice \npurposes only. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.e (in part), and 2.f. She denied all \nremaining allegations. Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor \nand testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old Arabic linguist working for a defense contractor. She \nwas born, raised, and educated in the Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt), where she \nreceived a psychology degree in 1979.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant first travelled to the United States in 1979. She and her husband \nstayed with her husband\u2019s Egyptian-born uncle for approximately one year. His uncle is \na 76-year-old professor at a U.S. university. Before immigrating to the United States, his \nuncle was a member of an Arab terrorist organization. He was granted asylum in 1963, \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen, and has been living in the United States since. He \nhas two U.S. born adult children: one is a professor at a U.S. university and the other a \nphysician (Tr. 105-106).  \n \nApplicant knew that her husband\u2019s uncle\u2019s associated with a terrorist organization \nwhen he was a young man. Her spouse disclosed his uncle\u2019s affiliation during a \nbackground interview (Tr. 193). To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, her husband\u2019s uncle is no \nlonger associated with any terrorist organizations. Applicant testified she hates her \nhusband\u2019s uncle because he is a womanizer and left his wife. She no longer affiliates \nwith his uncle. Applicant and her spouse testified they have never been involved in \npolitics or associated with any terrorist organizations. \n \nApplicant married her spouse in 1977 in Egypt; they immigrated to the United \nStates in 1984. Applicant and her spouse became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1993. \nThey have three adult children who are citizens and residents of the United States. Two \nof the children were born in Egypt and became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1994. The \nthird child was born in the United States. Applicant worked as a homemaker from 1977 \nuntil May 2007, when she took a position with a government contractor as an Arabic \nlinguist. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. She has three sisters. Two sisters are resident \nand naturalized citizens of the United States. The third sister is a citizen and resident of \nEgypt. Applicant is very close to her. Prior to 2006, they had personal contact every \nyear or every two years. Since 2006, they have telephone contact approximately twice a \nmonth (Tr. 102, 123-124). Her sister in Egypt has three children; two of them are U.S. \ncitizens. The third child is applying for a green card. Her and her husband have not \nworked for the Egyptian government, and they have not been involved in politics, or \nassociated with organizations adverse to the United States. Her husband owns a \nconstruction company which he is selling to immigrate to the United States. Applicant \napplied for her sister\u2019s U.S. residency in November 1996, and it has been approved. \nThe whole family is immigrating to the United States in the near future.  \n \nApplicant and her siblings inherited a home and three acres of land in Egypt \nwhen their father died in 1999. She claimed she sold her interest in the home to one of \nher sisters. The land has been in her family since the 1800s, and they have title to the \nland. She and her sisters share an equal interest in the land. She claimed they have not \nbeen able to sell it because over 17 of her relatives live on it. She claimed the land is \nstill in her father\u2019s name. She intends to renounce her interest in the land. She \npresented no documentary evidence to support her claims or to establish the value of \nthe land and home she inherited.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant travelled to Egypt with her children in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, and \n2003. She took her children sightseeing in Egypt and to visit with relatives. While in \nEgypt, they stayed with her sister. Her spouse accompanied them on one of the trips, \nbut she cannot recall which trip (Tr. 133). She repeatedly stated she considers the \nUnited States her country and reaffirmed her loyalty to the United States. The United \nStates is the country where she and her husband chose to live and raise their children. \nHer family never worked for the Egyptian government. She testified her family in Egypt \nis composed of mostly wealthy investors, who never had a need to work for the \ngovernment (Tr. 135).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband travelled to Egypt in December 1994. He also travelled to \nEgypt on three other occasions: in April 2000, to visit his mother who was terminally ill; \nin August 2000, to bury his mother; and in May 2002, to renounce his mother\u2019s \ninheritance.2 His last visit to Egypt was in 2007, for personal medical reasons. He \ndenied any of these visits were business related (Tr. 192).  \n \nHer spouse has two brothers and one sister who are citizens and residents of \nEgypt. His sister was a professor at an Egyptian university. She is now a homemaker. \nShe is married to an Egyptian who is the chief engineer for a large U.S. corporation \ndoing business in Egypt. Because of his job, they are planning to move to the United \nStates in the near future. Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that he is not close to his siblings \nand has infrequent contact with them. His contacts are limited to infrequent telephone \ncalls and email exchanges during holidays or special occasions. He averred that his \nsiblings are pro-American and have never been involved with politics or worked for the \nEgyptian government. One of his brothers worked as the \n \n.3 The other was the \u201cformer \n \n\u201d in Egypt. As of November 2004, he was the partner \nand director of an international relations company (AE 4). Applicant had a third brother \nwho was killed by sniper fire while in a \n in \nanother Middle East country. At the time, he was the \u201c\n \n\u201d (AE 4). \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s aunt, her sister and her husband, and one of their three \nchildren are citizens and residents of Egypt. His aunt lives in an Egyptian apartment \nrented by her husband since 1996. He testified his aunt pays the rent \u2013 approximately \n$8 monthly. He denied providing any financial support for his aunt. He explained that \nshe is old, sick, and has no children. He rented the apartment for her because she was \nafraid that being an old woman, she would be evicted unless she has the protection of a \nman. Applicant denied that her signature is on the lease contract. \n \n2 In a 2005 background interview, Applicant\u2019s husband indicated he was in the process of inheriting \naround $50,000-$60,000 from his mother\u2019s estate (GE 8). He provided no documentary evidence to show \nhe renounced his mother\u2019s estate. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s November 2004 email indicates his brother was the \u201c\n \n\u201d (AE 4). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was admitted to the practice of law in a U.S. state in 1992. \nShortly thereafter, he established his own law firm and practiced law until 2003. While \npracticing law in the United States, Applicant advertised he was licensed to practice law \nin Egypt, that his law firm was dedicated to the practice of law in Egypt, and that he was \ncertified by the Egyptian government as an international arbitrator (Tr. 200, GEs 9 and \n12). He denied he ever practiced law in Egypt. He claimed he only provided advice and \ntranslated documents (Tr. 210). During cross examination, he stated he stopped \nrepresenting clients in Egypt in 2004 (Tr. 267). On December 12, 1994, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse travelled to Egypt to represent a U.S. client in a monetary claim (AE 4). \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse denied that from approximately 1996-1998 to 2003, he had \nbusiness interests with or provided legal advice to his former law professor, and to his \nbrother-in-law, both citizens and residents of Egypt. However, in his answers to \nquestion 12 of his 2003, 2004, and 2006 of his security clearance applications (asking \nwhether he had any foreign property, business connections, of financial interests), he \ndisclosed that from 1998 to present he had a legal business cooperation agreement \nwith his former law professor, and that he had a \u201ccorresponding office, telephone, and \nfax\u201d with his brother-in-law. He further disclosed that from 2001 to present, he was \ncertified by the Egyptian government as an international arbitrator. He never had a client \nin his capacity as international arbitrator (Tr. 205). \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that he and his law professor are only acquaintances, \nand that they have not talked to each other since 2005, when he and Applicant moved \nto their current state of residence. He met the professor as a law student and had \ncontact with him while living in Egypt. He had no contact with the law professor from \n1984 until 1994. In 1994, he travelled to Egypt to represent a U.S. client, and he met \nwith the professor. Thereafter, they had contact approximately every two years. He \nprovided legal advice to his law professor in 1996-1997.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse represented his nephew and her sister\u2019s husband in a \nwrongful damages lawsuit on behalf of his nephew in the United States. His nephew \nwas born in the United States. Because of his nephew\u2019s lack of legal capacity, his \nbrother-in-law signed the representation documents and managed the lawsuit on behalf \nof his son (Tr. 204). \n \nFrom 1992 to around 2005, Applicant\u2019s spouse provided free consultation to \nEgyptian consulate personnel in the United States concerning U.S. legal matters. He \nalso provided comments for publication on international legal issues to a Middle Eastern \ncountry newspaper. Applicant\u2019s spouse never provided legal advice to the Egyptian \nconsulate itself. He only advised Egyptian consulate personnel on their personal legal \nissues. He represented an Egyptian embassy attach\u00e9 in a lawsuit, other embassy \npersonnel on contract litigation, and provided consultation on domestic matters. He \nstopped providing legal advice to Egyptian consulate personnel in January 2005 (Tr. \n206, 265).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nIn 2001-2002, Applicant\u2019s husband started working as an Arabic linguist. He was \ndeployed in 2003 to a Middle East country in support of a U.S. agency. Commensurate \nwith his duties, he was granted a top secret security clearance in early 2004, which was \nlatter withdrawn. There is no evidence that he compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. His performance as a linguist has been outstanding. \nHe is considered to be an asset to his organization. He has been commended for his \nstrong analytical skills, leadership, deep historical knowledge, and ability to work in \ndiverse teams. He is also considered to be a credible and honest person.  \n \nIn November 2003, a $45,877 federal tax lien was filed by the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) against Applicant and her husband for unpaid federal taxes for calendar \nyears 1993, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Final notices of intent to levy and \nenforcement action were issued on December 31, 2002, for tax year 1993; on February \n15, 2003, for tax years 1994, 1995, 1999, 2000, and 2001; and on March 17, 2006, for \ntax year 2002. For tax year 1993, Applicant and her husband\u2019s 1997 and 1998 tax \nreturns were offset on March 8, 2004, to pay part of their debt. For tax year 1994, \nApplicant and her husband made three $500 partial payments in August, September, \nand October 2006 (AE 7, Tab C, Tax Payer Advocate Service letter to Applicant and her \nspouse, dated May 30, 2008, with enclosure). They paid their IRS tax debt and the \nfederal tax lien was released on June 3, 2009 (AE 6). She disclosed her federal tax lien \nin her security clearance application.  \n \nSection 28 of Applicant\u2019s May 2007 security clearance application asked her to \ndisclose whether in the last seven years she had been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebts, and whether she was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt. Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose she and her husband were indebted to the IRS for \nunpaid federal taxes for years 1994, 1995, 1999, 2000, and 2001. I consider this an \ninadvertent omission because she disclosed that she had a $45,000 federal tax lien filed \nagainst her in 2003. She also failed to disclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f.4 \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege that Applicant is indebted on two delinquent medical \naccounts for $365 each. Applicant denied both allegations claiming they are not her \nmedical debts. She claimed she is never sick and has not been to the doctor in a long \ntime. She testified she found about the delinquent debts in 2006-2007 when she applied \nfor her position (Tr. 116). She claimed she called the collection agency and disputed the \naccounts. She presented no documentary evidence to support her claims. However, \nconsidering the lack of identification of the creditor on the CBRs, it would have been \ndifficult for her to ascertain whether these were her debts.  \n \n \n4 The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to disclose these debts under Guideline E. As such, this \ninformation cannot be used as a separate basis to deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Notwithstanding, I \nmay consider any behavior not alleged in the SOR to: assess her credibility; evaluate her evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; assess her possible rehabilitation; determine the \napplicability of the AGs; and conduct the whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that she is indebted to a large retailer for $4,536. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. She explained that around 2004, she purchased a home warranty \nfrom the retailer for approximately $600. Initially, she was making monthly payments of \n$84. For some unexplained reason, the payments were increased and she was asked \nto pay $120 a month, which she paid for some time. In 2005, the retailer increased the \ninterest and the monthly payments again. She refused to make any more payments. \nShe claimed she disputed the charges in writing and that the retailer never answered \nher complaints. When the retailer again asked her for payment, she suggested that the \nretailer sue her (Tr. 119). She claimed she had documentary evidence at home showing \nshe disputed the charges (Tr. 97, 116-117). She failed to produce it at the hearing or \nwith her post-hearing submissions.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that she is indebted on a bank credit card account for $3,882. \nApplicant denied this allegation because she has never had a personal credit card with \nthe bank. Applicant and her spouse\u2019s documents show they have been disputing \naccount number 3206, for $3,882, since November 2006. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s records \nshow he had another credit account with the same bank (number 6326 for $7,397), \nwhich became delinquent in 2002, and was charged off in May 2007. In December \n2008, he settled this account for $1,331, and paid it (AE 7, Tab D). Applicant and her \nhusband believe account 3206 is a fraudulent account, and the bank has failed to \nprovide them with evidence to show it is their account.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that she is indebted to a utility company for $606. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. She explained that she moved out of her home in June 2005, and \nturned the utilities off. After hurricane Katrina, the utility service company charged her \n$3,000. She claimed she disputed the initial charge in writing, and the company reduced \nthe debt to $606. Applicant claimed she again disputed the account because the home \nwas unoccupied and, after Katrina, the utility company was not able to provide service \nduring a lengthy period. She claimed she had documentary evidence at home showing \nshe disputed the charges (Tr. 122). She failed to produce it at the hearing or with her \npost-hearing submissions.  \n \nExcept for the above mentioned delinquent accounts and one additional charged \noff bank account (not alleged in the SOR), her 2007, 2008, and 2009 credit reports \nshow Applicant has a clean financial record with no other delinquencies indicated. \nApplicant testified she is good with her finances and that she does not have any \nfinancial problems. \n \nApplicant\u2019s references consider her to be a patriotic, loyal, and proud U.S. \ncitizen. She considers the United States her country, and indicated there is no other \nplace she would like to be. She and her husband elected to immigrate and raise their \nchildren in the United States. She has lived in the United States for 26 years and is \nencouraging her sister and her family in Egypt to emigrate and become U.S. citizens. \nShe expressed her gratitude for the benefits she and her family have received and \nenjoyed in the United States. There is no evidence to show that she or any member of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nher immediate family has ever done anything to threaten the security of the United \nStates.  \n \nHer references consider Applicant to be conscientious, thorough, and a hard \nworker. She is also considered to be a credible and honest person. She received their \nhighest recommendation, and they would trust her with the interests of the United \nStates. \n \nEgypt is the most populous country in the Arab world. It is a republic with a \ndeveloping economy and has a strong executive. Egypt is an important and strategic partner \nof the United States. The United States and Egypt enjoy a vibrant and friendly relationship \nbased on shared mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, strengthening trade \nrelations, and promoting regional security. Egypt played a key role during the 1990-1991 \nGulf crisis, and the United States and Egypt participate in combined military exercises. The \nEgyptian government receives substantial U.S. foreign aid.  \n \nDespite governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Egypt \nremains high. Over the years, Egypt has suffered from numerous terrorist attacks. Major \nterrorist attacks where foreigners (including Americans) have been killed have occurred \nmost recently in 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009. Terrorists in Egypt target U.S. interests to \nexploit and undermine U.S. national security interests. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as state intelligence services. In addition to terrorism, extremist \nactivities in certain areas of Egypt have created instability and public disorder. \n \nThe State Department notes that Egypt's human rights record is poor and serious \nabuses continue in many areas. Problems include: limitations on the right of citizens to \nchange their government; torture; arbitrary arrest; prolonged detention; poor conditions in \nprisons; executive branch limits on an independent judiciary; political prisoners and \ndetainees; and restrictions on freedom of press, assembly, association, religion, and Internet \nfreedom. Torture occurs in Egyptian detention centers. Government corruption and lack of \ntransparency persist. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. They provide \nexplanations for each guideline and list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s goal is to achieve a \nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. (AG \u00b6 2(c).) \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d5 Once the \ngovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment.6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \n5 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nIn November 2003, the IRS filed a $45,877 federal tax lien against Applicant and \nher husband for unpaid federal taxes for calendar years 1993, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2000, \nand 2001. Their 1997 and 1998 tax returns were offset on March 8, 2004, and applied \nto their debt. Applicant and her husband started negotiating with the IRS in 2006, and in \n2009 their tax debt was paid and the lien was released.  \n \nI find for Applicant on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, because the \navailable information is not sufficient to identify the creditor. I also find for Applicant on \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. Her evidence shows she and her husband have been disputing the debt \nsince November 2006, and their dispute is sufficiently reasonable to justify non-payment \nsubject to judicial determination of financial responsibility.  \n \nApplicant is indebted to a large retailer for $4,536 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). She purchased a \nhome warranty from the retailer and was making payments on her contract until the \nretailer increased the interest and the monthly payments. She then refused to make any \nmore payments. She claimed she disputed the charges in writing and that the retailer \nnever answered her complaints. When the retailer asked her for payment again, she \nsuggested that the retailer sue her. Applicant also claimed she disputed the debt in \nwriting alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for utility services she did not receive. She failed to produce \ndocumentary evidence showing she disputed either debt. Her evidence is not sufficient \nto show the basis of her disputes are reasonable.  \n \nThe IRS lien and her delinquent debts trigger the applicability of disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I conclude that none of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent because two of her debts are \nunresolved. The evidence is not sufficient to fully raise: circumstances beyond her \ncontrol; that she received financial counseling; that she made good-faith efforts to \nresolve the two outstanding delinquent debts; or that she had a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of her delinquent debts. \n \n \nApplicant receives credit for paying her federal tax debt, for reasonably disputing \nother debts, and for having a relatively clean financial record with seemingly no financial \nproblems. Notwithstanding, considering the evidence as a whole, including her \ndemeanor and testimony, her failure to show diligence and efforts to resolve her \nfinancial obligations shows lack of judgment or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. Her behavior raises questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the Government\u2019s concern is stated in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                           \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign own or foreign operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.7  \n \nApplicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship of affection or obligation \nwith her sister, aunt, and through her spouse, with her in-laws who are citizens and \nresidents of Egypt. The closeness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s telephone \nand email contacts with them, directly or through her husband, and her and her \nspouse\u2019s travel to Egypt to visit their family. Additionally, she co-owns with her siblings \nreal estate they inherited from her father in Egypt.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was a member of the Egyptian security forces. He has long-\ntime friends, business partners or associates in Egypt, some of whom are or were \nmembers of the Egyptian security services. He continued his association with the \nEgyptian government when he provided legal advice to Egyptian embassy personnel in \nthe United States, and by meeting with Egyptian government personnel attending \ntraining in the United States. His comments for publication on international legal issues \nto a Middle Eastern country newspaper likely brought him to the attention of Egyptian \ngovernment officials, and possibly terrorist organizations. His brothers are or were high \nlevel officials of the Egyptian government. His contacts create a heightened risk of \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that \nEgyptian agents, or terrorists operating in Egypt, may exploit the opportunity to obtain \nsensitive or classified U.S. information. \n \n  \nThe threat of terrorism in Egypt is high. Over the years, Egypt has suffered from \nnumerous terrorist attacks. Terrorists in Egypt target U.S. interests to exploit and undermine \nU.S. national security interests. They conduct intelligence activities as effectively as state \nintelligence services. There is also the possibility that terrorists, extremists, or criminal \norganizations may exploit the opportunity to obtain sensitive or classified U.S. \ninformation. \n \n \n7 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the Government. \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I conclude that none of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply. Applicant did not establish that it is unlikely she will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of her relatives and her in-laws and \nthe U.S. interests. Her contacts are not casual or infrequent. The contacts are not U.S. \nGovernment sanctioned. And, she has not established that the value of the property is \ninsignificant. \n \nIn light of the relations between Egypt and the United States and the high threat \nof terrorism in Egypt, Applicant\u2019s close relationship with her and her spouse\u2019s relatives \n\n \n14 \n \n \nand friends creates a risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion by \nthe Egyptian government or terrorist organizations operating in Egypt. Her contact and \nclose relationship with her relatives could potentially force her to choose between the \nUnited States and the interests of her relatives in Egypt. Available information sustains \na conclusion that there is a risk that the Egyptian government, or terrorist organizations \noperating in Egypt, may attempt to exploit Applicant directly, or by exploiting Applicant\u2019s \nrelatives or her husband\u2019s relatives. Applicant\u2019s situation creates a potential conflict of \ninterest between Applicant\u2019s obligations to protect sensitive information and her desire \nor obligation to help herself, or help her family if a foreign interest were to attempt to \nexploit them. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has a long-standing relationship \nand demonstrated loyalty to the United States. She and her family have lived in the \nUnited States during the last 26 years. By all accounts, they are patriotic Americans \nwho consider the United States their country. There is no evidence that either Applicant \nor any member of her family has ever done anything against the U.S. interests.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an educated woman, \nand a good mother and wife. She and her husband supported the war on terror working \nas Arabic linguists and by his deployment to a Middle East country in support of a U.S. \nagency. There is no evidence that Applicant or her immediate family compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant is a patriotic, loyal, and proud U.S. citizen. She considers the United \nStates her country, and there is no other place she would rather be. She and her \n\n \n15 \n \n \nhusband elected to immigrate and raise their children in the United States. She has \nlived in the United States for 26 years and is encouraging her sister and her family in \nEgypt to emigrate and become U.S. citizens. She expressed her gratitude for the \nbenefits she and her family have received and enjoyed in the United States. There is no \nevidence to show that she or any member of her immediate family has ever done \nanything to threaten the security of the United States.  \n \nApplicant is considered to be conscientious, thorough, and a hard worker. She \nreceived their highest recommendations from her references as a credible and honest \nperson. They would trust her with the interests of the United States. \n \nNevertheless, considering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s handling of her \nfinancial affairs and her contacts with relatives in Egypt, leave me with doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of \nsecurity matters, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nWhenever any doubt is raised . . .  it is deemed best to err on the side of the \ngovernment\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990).  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations and foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c, 1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n    \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1f: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c, \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   2.e, 2.f: \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:   \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant.

Savarino, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 12 February 2009 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations.  Applicant answered the SOR 3 March 2009,\n1\nrequesting a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 2 April 2009, and I convened a\nhearing 21 May 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 2 June 2009.\n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied the SOR allegations, except for 1.g.\u20131.j., on some of which he\ndisputed the balance owed. He is a 42-year-old test engineer employed by a defense\ncontractor since September 2007. He has not previously held a clearance. He has a\nMay 28, 2010\n\nIn March 2008, the creditor offered a settlement based on prompt payment of approximately half the amount\n2\ndue, but Applicant was unable to take advantage of the offer. However, the creditor repeated the offer in\nSeptember 2008, albeit at a higher figure, and Applicant paid the agreed amount in September 2008.\nAlthough they were paid after Applicant\u2019s April 2008 interview with a government investigator.\n3\nAE A, Tab B documents a $738 payment on a delinquent medical account in August 2008. The collection\n4\nagent was collecting a medical debt for a provider who is not identified in the record credit reports (GE 3, 4),\nusing what appears to be his internal account number for collection purposes. Thus, the payment\nacknowledgment does not confirm Applicant\u2019s claim that three accounts owed to the same creditor had been\ncombined. GE 3 shows three separate account numbers, but does not identify the medical provider, each\naccount having already gone to an unidentified collection agent. GE 4 shows only the account at SOR 1.b.\nHowever, the debt was reported in January 2008, well before Applicant\u2019s August 2008 payment. Nevertheless,\ngiven the vagaries of credit reports, the total debt paid by Applicant is consistent with the totals alleged in SOR\n1.b, 1.g, and 1.k.\n2\nbachelor\u2019s degree in management, a master\u2019s degree in business administration, and is\nworking on a master\u2019s degree in information technology. He also holds a real-estate\nlicense.\nThe SOR originally alleged, and government exhibits confirmed, 15 delinquent\ndebts totaling nearly $68,000. Applicant admitted four debts (1.g\u20131.j) totaling nearly\n$34,000, although he disputes some of the amounts alleged to be delinquent.\nApplicant\u2019s evidence (GE 2, AE A) proved that he paid the debts at SOR 1.a, 1.c,\n1.d,  and 1.m before the SOR was issued.  Accordingly, I resolve those allegations for\n2\n3\nApplicant. Applicant asserts, with incomplete corroboration, that a payment made to a\nmedical collection agent (AE A, Tab B) represents payment for the medical debts\nalleged at SOR 1.b, 1.f, and 1.k. On balance, I conclude the evidence supports\nApplicant\u2019s claim and find those three allegations for him.  Applicant also provided\n4\nevidence that he disputed the debts at SOR 1.g, 1.j, n, and 1.o, without response from\nthe credit reporting agency (AE A, Tab O, P).\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are rooted in a business venture he undertook\nwith a partner in 1998 or 1999. At the time, Applicant was selling real estate. He and his\npartner decided to purchase marginal properties, perform minimal repairs on the\nproperties to make them habitable, rent them for 2\u20132\u00bd years, then sell them for a\nsubstantial profit\u2014assuming substantial appreciation on the properties. This is\ncommonly known as \u201cflipping,\u201d although Applicant and his partner seem to have held\nthe properties longer than usual, reflecting their minimal investment in repairs or\nrenovations.\nInitially, Applicant and his partner operated informally as a partnership. He\nclaims, without corroboration, that they incorporated in 2004 or 2005, but none of the\ndebts alleged in the SOR appear to be debts of the corporation. Applicant funded this\nenterprise with his savings, credit cards, lines of credit, and his income from his real\nestate job. His partner apparently relied on similar funding sources. After a few\nsuccessful purchases, the enterprise became his sole source of income.\n\n3\nApplicant estimates that he and his partner eventually bought as many as 20\nhouses, although Applicant also bought some properties as an individual. Initially, they\nobtained commercial mortgages for their purchases, but eventually went to seller\nfinancing. According to Applicant, he and his partner would sell two or three properties\nper year, pocket enough money to cover living expenses for the next year, and put the\nrest of the profit into more properties. They appear to have not made any provision for\npaying their annual income taxes.\n  Applicant has given varying explanations for his financial difficulties. In his April\n2008 interview (GE 2), he stated that he and his partner overextended themselves and\nbecame unable to carry the debt load they had taken on to improve the properties. He\nalso acknowledged owing most of the debts in the SOR. He had previously disclosed\nover $52,000 in delinquent debt on his clearance application (GE 1), including a debt\n(SOR 1.o) that he later claimed was not his. In April 2008, Applicant was still upbeat\nabout the prospects of selling his remaining properties and satisfying his delinquent\ndebt. \nAt hearing, he largely attributed his financial difficulties to the decline in the\nhousing market in the mid-2000s. Applicant and his partner began to notice declines in\nthe market in 2004 or 2005. Properties that had sold in a matter of days with minimal\ninvestment were now requiring six months to sell\u2014and repairs and renovations of more\nthan $12,000 to get them market ready.\nApplicant\u2019s August 2008 personal financial statement (GE 2) reflects $2,500\npositive monthly cash flow, not including any payments on his delinquent accounts. His\nongoing financial difficulties are best exemplified by his efforts to address four large\ndebts that remain outstanding. He reached a settlement agreement for each, but did not\nmake the payments as promised despite the apparent means to do so.\nApplicant owed about $7,000 on a revolving account (SOR 1.e) that he used to\nfinance repairs on his properties. In August 2008, he reached an agreement with the\ncreditor to settle the account for less than half the outstanding balance if he would make\n36 monthly payments of $90 beginning in September 2008 (GE 2; AE A, Tab E).\nApplicant documented one $90 payment made in August 2008 (GE 2). Thereafter, he\nhas only documented payments of $15 in January 2009 and March 2009 (AE A, Tab E).\nHe made one other payment, illegible in both date and amount.\nApplicant owed nearly $26,000 on a revolving account (SOR 1.h) that he also\nused to finance repairs on his properties. In August 2008, the creditor agreed to settle\nthe account for 50% of the balance due, conditioned on receipt of monthly $260\npayments at the end ofAugust, September, and October 2008, with a lump-sum payment\nof $12,180 by the end of November 2008 (GE 2; AE A, Tab H). At the time Applicant\nagreed to this repayment schedule, he anticipated the imminent sale of the property. He\nmade the scheduled August 2008 payment of $260, but the sale did not materialize.\nApplicant then rented the property. He made token payments to the creditor in October\n2008 ($60), January 2009 ($15), and March 2009 ($15). He documented one other\n\n4\npayment, illegible in both date and amount. He has not documented his claim that the\ncreditor has agreed to accept token payments until he can sell the property.\nApplicant was over $3,100 behind on a mortgage (SOR 1.i) of $125,000. In\nAugust 2008, he made his regular monthly payment ($1,270) when he owed a total of\n$4,119 (GE 2). In March 2009, the creditor offered Applicant a temporary repayment plan\nto bring the account current, conditioned on a $2,000 lump-sum payment by April 2009\nand 12 $1,500 payments beginning May 2009 (AE A, Tab I). Applicant claims, without\ncorroboration, to have made the required payments.\nApplicant owed over $17,000 to a collection agent for state income taxes (SOR\n1.l) Applicant incurred because he did not withhold any income taxes when he sold\nproperties for a profit. He made payments to the creditor in early July 2008 ($300), late\nJuly 2008 ($250), August 2008 ($250), and mid-December 2008 ($250). He documented\ntwo other payments, both illegible in date and amount. Despite these payments, the mid-\nDecember 2008 statement from the creditor reflects that Applicant still owes over\n$17,000. He made a token $15 payment in March 2009 (AE A, Tab L). Applicant asserts,\nwithout corroboration, that he owes less than the $17,000 alleged because the state\nseized a $6,000 income tax refund for tax year 2007. He also asserts, without\ncorroboration, that his tax accountant believes that losses in later tax years will satisfy\nany outstanding tax balance (Tr. 59-60, 96).\nApplicant still owns two properties with his partner. They are upside down (owe\nmore than they can sell the property for) on the mortgages, but both properties are\nrented for enough to cover the mortgage payments. Applicant owns four properties by\nhimself, one of which he lives in. The other three are rented for enough to cover the\nmortgage payments. Of these four houses, he believes he is upside down in two and\nwould break even if he sold the other two.\nApplicant got some financial counseling a couple of weeks before the hearing,\nand the counselor recommended Applicant continue to work directly with his creditors.\nHe has a current financial statement (AE A, Tab Q) that shows $1,000 positive monthly\ncash flow after making $1,900 monthly debt payments to unidentified creditors.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor since August 2007 considers him an honest and trustworthy\nemployee, and recommends him for his clearance. He is aware of the allegations of the\nSOR, but has not seen any indications of financial issues at work (AE A, Tab R).\nApplicant acknowledges being legally and morally obligated to pay his delinquent\ndebts. For this reason, he has not sought bankruptcy protection. He recently rented out a\nroom in his house to defray expenses, and is economizing by not taking vacations as he\ndid in the past. However, he admits that he will not really be able to resolve his remaining\ndebts unless the housing market improves and he is able to sell his rental properties.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n6\n5\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to be considered in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or absence\nof a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against applicant.\nHowever, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case can be\nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as\na whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access to\nclassified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.5\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has significant delinquent debt\ndating back to 2004-5 for which he has no ameliorating explanation.  Setting aside for\n6\nthe moment the debts he now contests despite having previously acknowledged them to\nbe his, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Applicant, he has financial\ndifficulties that he has not addressed in meaningful ways. In the final analysis, he has\nfour delinquent debts totaling nearly $54,000 that he acknowledges owing, for which he\nhad repayment agreements that he could not meet, and that he cannot realistically\nexpect to pay unless the housing market recovers substantially or his tax accountant is\ncorrect in his opinion that Applicant\u2019s remaining tax liability will be offset by later year\nlosses.\n\n\u00b6 20.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n7\nit is  unlikely to recur .\n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n8\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n\u00b6 20.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n9\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n10\n6\nThe mitigating factors for financial concerns provide Applicant little relief. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and did not occur under circumstances\nunlikely to recur.  Assuming for the moment that the debts can be attributed to the\n7\ndecline in the housing market, and thus due to circumstances beyond his control, he has\nonly partially acted responsibly in addressing his debts.  He has repeatedly entered into\n8\nrepayment agreements with his creditors, only to make one (or a few) of the required\npayments before devolving to token payments. While the SOR 1.h debt had a lump-sum\npayment that was clearly contingent on Applicant\u2019s ability to sell the related property, the\nother agreed-upon payments seemed well within Applicant\u2019s financial means. Yet, he\nhas not adequately explained his inability to keep up with, for example, a $90 monthly\npayment.\nThe above analysis assumes that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were largely due\nto the decline in the housing market, and that Applicant had entered into a prudent\nfinancial enterprise with his partner. However, neither of these assumptions are foregone\nconclusions. The record evidence shows that whatever the decline in the housing\nmarket, Applicant and his partner had overextended themselves in investing in\nproperties. Further, the evidence shows that despite degrees in management and\nbusiness administration, and a real estate license, Applicant and his partner invested in\nreal estate with little or no equity in the properties and little margin for error. The fact that\nApplicant and his partner were successful for a time does not obscure the fact that they\nengaged in a high-risk, highly leveraged enterprise. They used unsecured credit to fund\nrepairs and renovations, and made no provision for satisfying their tax liabilities when\nproperties sold.\nApplicant has not sought meaningful credit counseling, made a budget that\ndemonstrates how he will pay his delinquent debts, or devised a plan to address his\ndebts, so I cannot conclude he has brought the financial problem under control.  While I\n9\ncannot conclude that his efforts to pay his creditors were made in bad faith, in the final\nanalysis those efforts have been sporadic and ineffective.  Although, DOHA is not the\n10\ncollection agent of last resort, Applicant has failed to demonstrate why he has not come\nup with a viable plan for his delinquent debt, if he has the means. If he lacks the means\nof addressing his delinquent debt now, he will not be in a position to do so unless and\nuntil the housing market recovers and he is able to sell his investment properties. I\ncannot speculate when that may be. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Todd W. Reid, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn November 10, 2005, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On September 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 27, 2008. He \nanswered the SOR in writing on October 15, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on September 29, 2008. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on October 22, 2008.  DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on January 12, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 27, \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through E, without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 6, 2009. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit additional matters.  On February \n5, 2009, he submitted Exhibits F to I, without objection. The record closed on February \n10, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 15, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.e, and 1.h of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k of the SOR. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is married (in 2003), and 56 years old.  He was in private business until \nSeptember 2004, when his employment was terminated. He now seeks a security \nclearance so that he can work for a defense contractor.  He signed a letter of intent with \nthe company in September 2005, being considered a contingent hire, and the company \nis waiting for him to obtain his security clearance. (Tr. 63, 64, 69-73; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant has a college degree he obtained in 1975.  He also obtained another \ndegree in February 2006, in an attempt to retrain himself after his prior business \nrelationship was terminated in September 2004. Applicant was unemployed from \nSeptember 2004 until May 2008.  He and his wife work as title abstractors on a per \ndiem payment basis, earning about $75,000 before taxes and deductions annually.  His \nwife owns a home in Toronto, Canada (she is a U.S. citizen), and Applicant owns a \nhome in his hometown.  He and his wife pay $535 monthly on the Canadian mortgage, \nand the home in the United States has no mortgage debt on it.  Applicant owns two \nhigh-mileage automobiles which are fully paid. He has one credit card on which there is \nno balance owed, and two gasoline credit cards which also have no balances on them.  \nHe pays his monthly debts on time and is current on them.  Since his September 2004 \ntermination, Applicant has not used credit cards to maintain his lifestyle, nor has he \nincurred any delinquent debt.  He has not purchased a new car, or anything involving a \nsubstantial amount of money.  He did borrow money to pay for his degree as part of his \neffort to retrain himself.  Those student loans of $40,000 for his latest degree are being \npaid on time at the rate of $164.57 monthly.  (Tr. 38-40, 43, 44, 53-55, 60-62, 68) \n \n \nApplicant was the manager of an auto transmission store and the area \ndevelopment representative for the franchisor for the same company.  He managed the \nstore and held 49% of the stock in the corporation from 1985 to 2004.  His income in \n2004 was about $90,000 from this business.  He had a partner who also owned 49% of \nthe stock.  A third partner owned 2%.  In September 2004, Applicant received a letter \nfrom his partners announcing the date for a stockholder\u2019s meeting, which had not \noccurred previously during the life of the corporation.  At that meeting, Applicant was \nremoved as a director and his employment contract was terminated.  Applicant retained \n\n \n3 \n \n \nattorneys in 2005 and sued his former partners for shareholder oppression and wrongful \ntermination.  The lawsuit is scheduled to be heard in April 2009 for a decision on the \nmerits.  He attempted to negotiate a settlement with his former partners from 2005 to \nthe current time, but has been unsuccessful.  (Tr. 21-27, 69-76; Exhibit D) \n \n \nThe SOR lists 11 delinquent debts, totaling about $87,000.  The delinquent debt \non the January 2009 credit report is $63,675.  All of the debts listed in the SOR pertain \nto credit card debt incurred before September 2004, except the electric power debts \n(the final two allegations in the SOR, Subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k, for $140 and $282, \nrespectively), which Applicant asserts he paid in November 2004.  Applicant terminated \nthe other credit card accounts in October 2004, and returned the credit cards to the \nissuers.  Before 2004, Applicant had excellent credit and paid his debts in a timely \nmanner, as shown on his 2000 and 2003 credit reports. (Tr. 19, 20, 24, 30-37, 52, 66, \n67, 87; Exhibits 2-5, A, B) \n \n \nApplicant owes $7,850 on a credit card (Subparagraph 1.a).  It has not been \nrepaid. (Tr. 31, 32; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $3,409 to a collector for a store credit card (Subparagraph 1.b).  \nIt has not been repaid. (Tr. 19, 32; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $17,165 on a bank credit card (Subparagraph 1.c).  It has not \nbeen repaid. (Tr. 19, 33; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $11,907 on a store credit card (Subparagraph 1.d).  It has not \nbeen repaid.  Applicant is attempting through his attorney to negotiate a settlement on \nthis account at 35-40% of the balance, but the creditor has not responded to the \nattorney\u2019s offer. (Tr. 19, 34, 82; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $2,956 on a store credit card (Subparagraph 1.e).  It has not \nbeen repaid. (Tr. 19, 35; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $3,675 to a collector (Subparagraph 1.f).  It has not been repaid. \nApplicant has a current offer outstanding to settle this debt at the 35-40% rate of the \nbalance, but the creditor has not responded to the offer. (Tr. 82; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $12,717 to a collector (Subparagraph 1.g).  It has not been \nrepaid. (Tr. 30, 36; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $12,749 to a collector for a credit card debt (Subparagraph 1.h).  \nIt has not been repaid. It may be a duplicate billing for the debt set forth in \nSubparagraph 1.g because of the similarity of the amounts.  This debt also has a \npending settlement offer made to the creditor by Applicant\u2019s attorney, but the creditor \nhas not responded to it yet. (Tr. 31, 36, 82; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant owes $9,413 to a collector on behalf of a financial institution \n(Subparagraph 1.i).  It has not been repaid. (Tr. 37; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s attorney sent letters to all these creditors on January 19, 2009, \nseeking to negotiate a compromise and settlement of these debts.  He has not received \nreplies as of the date of the hearing to these letters with specific proposals to settle \nthese debts for amounts less than listed in the SOR.  Applicant expected his lawsuit \nagainst his former partner would be settled in 2006 or 2007, enabling him to recoup \nfunds sufficient to repay these debts.  That settlement of the lawsuit has not occurred.  \nThe case is now set for trial in April 2009.  (Tr. 21-26, 49, 52; Exhibits C, D, E) \n \n \nApplicant has a federal tax debt from 2004 and 2005 of $5,225.18, resulting from \nthe closure of his transmission businesses after his ouster from the corporation.  He has \nan installment payment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through \nwhich he pays at least $137 monthly.  He owes $4,220 to a state tax agency for the \nsame business closures, and pays $188.21 monthly on that installment payment \nagreement. (Tr. 58-60) \n \n \nA long-time friend of Applicant testified for him.  He considers Applicant a \nmathematical expert, and very trustworthy.  He would employ him in a sensitive position \nin his company any time. (Tr. 92-108) \n \n \nApplicant gave credible and persuasive testimony.  He was well organized in his \npresentation, and was specific in his recollections of past events, and financial \nobligations. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt after he was ousted from his \ncorporate position in 2004.  He was financially unable to pay these obligations for the \n\n \n6 \n \n \npast four years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be \nmitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial \nworries arose after September 2004. He had credit card debt which he incurred in the \nnormal course of his business and personal activities.  He paid these debts on time \neach month until he lost his job in September 2004.  Then he did not have any income \nfrom which to pay these debts. These circumstances are no longer extant because they \nwere unique based on his corporate position, loss of that job, and the resultant inability \nto pay the debt when he was unemployed. I find the behavior occurred under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this \npotentially mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose from his lengthy period of unemployment since \nSeptember 2004 to the present.  He became unemployed when he was ousted from his \ncorporate position through no fault of his own, but rather the action of his now former \npartner. He acted responsibly by canceling the credit cards immediately, and not \naccumulating any more debt, except  his student loans used by Applicant to obtain \nretraining. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this \ncase.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c).  Since 2005 Applicant has been represented \nby attorneys in attempts to settle the debts and get them paid by proceeds of his lawsuit \nagainst his former partner. His attorney has the problem under control, and is \nattempting to resolve it with all the creditors.  This mitigating condition applies.  \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant \nretained an attorney to represent him on all the delinquent debts, and to resolve them \neither by payment or settlement.  He paid the two energy debts in early 2005.  He has \nnine delinquent debts remaining, and intends to pay these from the proceeds of his \nlawsuit against his former partner for ousting him from the corporation they both owned. \nI conclude this potentially mitigating condition applies. If he does obtain a satisfactory \njudgment in the case, he remains willing to pay the debts in accordance with the \nsettlement offers he made when he earns the funds to do so. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe remaining two mitigating conditions have no applicability to this case, and \nare not relevant.  Applicant is not disputing the debts, and there is no affluence resulting \nfrom a legal source of income. \n \nFinally, the security concern stated in AG \u00b6 18 is directed toward the failure or \ninability of an applicant to spend his income responsibly, and pay his debts in a timely \nmanner.  These actions, the concern states, show poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nan unwillingness to live by certain rules.  However, Applicant demonstrated he was \npaying his debts before his corporate termination at the shareholder\u2019s meeting in \nSeptember 2004.  Only that action, which surprised him, and his subsequent \nunemployment until May 2008, have prevented him from paying these debts.  His \nrecord of responsible financial management during his business career shows this \nsecurity concern is not applicable in Applicant\u2019s unique situation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case to be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant clearly explained in a \ncredible and persuasive manner that but for the actions of his partner in 2004, which \ncame as a complete surprise to him at the shareholder\u2019s meeting, he would have \ncontinued to pay the debts listed in the SOR on time, and they would never have been \nan issue. Applicant also demonstrated his efforts since 2004 to resolve these debts \nthrough legal representation on proposed settlements with the creditors.  His attorney \nalso filed a lawsuit against the former partner seeking compensation for the unlawful \nactions.  This lawsuit, if successful, would yield sufficient funds to repay all these debts, \nespecially if the creditors agreed to reduce the amounts sought by eliminating interest \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand penalty fees accumulated on the accounts since 2004.  If he is not successful, he is \ncommitted to repaying his debts from his future income.  These debts are ancillary to \nthe main issue of the corporate wrongdoing; they cannot be a source of improper \npressure or duress because of their public nature. Of course, the issue is not simply \nwhether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns \nabout his fitness to hold a security clearance. While the debts remain unpaid pending \nthe outcome of the lawsuit, they are insufficient under these unique circumstances to \nraise security concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant also. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nAfter considering all of the evidence presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  His eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a, and his admissions are incorporated herein. Applicant testified on his own behalf and I found his testimony credible. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been married since 1986. He and his wife have a 12-year-old son. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and an MBA in engineering management. His job title or position is engineering manager for the electrical engineering department of the company.

Teakell, Esq.\n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nThis is a security clearance case in which Applicant contests the Defense\nDepartment\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for an industrial security clearance. The\naction is based on Applicant\u2019s two alcohol-related incidents away from work. The first\nwas a citation for drinking in public in 1999. The second was an arrest for driving under\nthe influence of alcohol (DUI) in April 2008. The record contains substantial evidence of\nreform and rehabilitation such as: (1) Applicant has abstained from alcohol for the last\n15 months; (2) he has not received a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence,\nor alcoholism, and he has not been required to obtain counseling or treatment; and (3)\nhis most recent alcohol-related incident, the April 2008 DUI, was resolved in February\n2009, when he entered a year-long pretrial diversion program and prosecution was\ndeferred. Accordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is decided for\nApplicant. \nAugust 24, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then\nmodified by the Defense Department, and made effective September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They\nsupersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on November 26, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details\nthe factual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline G\nfor alcohol consumption and Guideline J for criminal conduct. The SOR also\nrecommended submitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination to\ndeny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 16, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on May 4, 2009. The case was delayed at the\nrequest of Applicant\u2019s counsel to accommodate his litigation schedule. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on July 17, 2009. The testimony of three witnesses, including\nApplicant, was taken, and Government Exhibits 1 through 4 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nA\u20131 through A\u20138 were admitted. The record was kept open until July 31, 2009, to allow\nApplicant to submit additional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely\nreceived per e-mail, and they are marked and admitted without objections as follows: (1)\nExhibit B\u2013traffic ticket and complaint for the 1999 alcohol-related incident; and (2)\nExhibit C\u2013conditions of release and order for the 1999 alcohol-related incident. The\nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received July 27, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a, and his\nadmissions are incorporated herein. Applicant testified on his own behalf and I found his\ntestimony credible. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established\nby substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been married\nsince 1986. He and his wife have a 12-year-old son. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree\nin electrical engineering and an MBA in engineering management. His job title or\nposition is engineering manager for the electrical engineering department of the\ncompany. He has worked for his current employer since 2001, although he previously\nworked for the company from 1986 to 1999. He held a security clearance during that\nperiod as well. He is seeking to upgrade an existing security clearance to a higher level.\nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents away from work, which he\ndoes not dispute. Indeed, he reported the 1999 citation for drinking in public and the\n\n Exhibit 1. \n2\n Exhibits B and C. \n3\n Tr. 55. \n4\n Tr. 56\u201357. \n5\n Tr. 57; Exhibit A\u20131. \n6\n Exhibit 4; Tr. 36\u201337. \n7\n Exhibit A\u20132. \n8\n Tr. 35, 59\u201360. \n9\n3\n2008 DUI arrest on his security-clearance application, which he completed and certified\nas true in 2008.2\nThe 1999 alcohol-related incident occurred when Applicant was on a business\ntrip. At the time, he was not working for a federal contractor and did not hold a security\nclearance. Applicant and a business colleague were at a hotel playing pool and having a\nfew drinks. Unexpectedly, another colleague called and needed a ride from the airport.\nApplicant went along as a passenger and took his drink with him. The end result was\nthe local police cited Applicant at the airport for the misdemeanor offense of \u201cconsuming\nspiritous liquor in pubic,\u201d otherwise known as drinking in public.  Applicant was released\n3\nand allowed to return to the hotel. He returned to his state of residence upon completing\nthe business trip. Thereafter, he pleaded guilty to the offense and paid a small fine\nthrough the mail. \nThe 2008 alcohol-related incident also occurred when Applicant was on a\nbusiness trip. He had drunk about four and one-half glasses of wine at the hotel after\nwork.  Later in the evening, Applicant left the hotel and drove to a local restaurant where\n4\nhe had something to eat and had two beers.  The police stopped Applicant on the way\n5\nback to the hotel based on a traffic violation (driving left of the center line). The police\ngave Applicant field-sobriety tests and then arrested him for DUI. At the station,\nApplicant took a Breathalyzer test with results of .119, which was in excess of what is\npermissible under state law.  He was released on a bond, completed the business trip,\n6\nand returned to his state of residence. He reported the DUI arrest to company officials\nwhen he returned to work.7\nApplicant sought to have the DUI case resolved through a pretrial diversion\nprogram. In January 2009, he returned to the state of the DUI arrest and underwent an\nalcohol evaluation.  Applicant does not know the results of the evaluation, but the\n8\nresults were reported to the pretrial diversion program.  Thereafter, on February 13,\n9\n2009, Applicant entered into a seven-page agreement wherein the local district attorney\nagreed to defer prosecution for 12 months (until February 2010), and Applicant agreed\n\n Exhibit A\u20131 at pp. 2\u20134 (setting forth 13 conditions of pretrial diversion). \n10\n Exhibit A\u20131 at p. 2. \n11\n Exhibit A\u20131 at p. 1. \n12\n Exhibit A\u20131 at p. 6. \n13\n Tr. 54, 61. \n14\n Tr. 54. \n15\n Tr. 50, 54, 61. \n16\n Exhibits A\u20133 and A\u20134; Tr. 33-34. \n17\n Tr. 34. \n18\n See Tr. 59\u201360. \n19\n Tr. 60. \n20\n4\nto abide by certain conditions and requirements of the program.  If he successfully\n10\ncompletes the program, no prosecution will be instituted and the case will be dismissed\nwith prejudice.  If he violates the agreement, the district attorney may revoke or modify\n11\nthe agreement, change the period of supervision, or ask the court to reinstate the case\non the docket for further prosecution.   \n12\nAs part of the agreement, Applicant stipulated that the allegations in the\ncomplaint or information were true and factually correct, and he admitted that he was\nguilty of the following charges: (1) the traffic offense of driving on the left half of the\nroad; (2) unlawfully driving and operating a motor vehicle with an alcohol concentration\nin his breath of .119, which exceeds the amount allowed under state law; and (3)\nunlawfully driving and operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  But\n13\nunder the terms of the agreement, Applicant is not now convicted of any offense. \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol as required by the program. Indeed, he has\nabstained since his arrest in April 2008.   In the past, Applicant never drank at home\n14\nand only drank alcohol when he was on business trips three to four times per year.  He\n15\nintends not to drink alcohol in the future.  To date, he completed the program\u2019s\n16\nrequirements except for monthly reporting, which is an ongoing requirement.  In July\n17\n2009, officials advised Applicant that he may apply for early dismissal, but he has not\ntaken action on it.18\nApplicant has not received a diagnosis or evaluation of alcohol abuse, alcohol\ndependence, or alcoholism.  Likewise, Applicant was not required to attend alcohol\n19\ncounseling, treatment, or a rehabilitation program, and he was not required to\nparticipate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or a similar organization.20\n\n See Exhibits A\u20135, A\u20136, A\u20137, and A\u20138; Tr. 63\u201384 (testimony of two character witnesses). \n21\n Tr. 73\u201374. \n22\n Department of Navy v.

Mar. 23, 2004).\n27\n5\nApplicant is a highly successful employee.  For example, he received an\n21\nachievement award for exceptional performance in June 2009. Likewise, he received an\noverall performance rating of exceeds expectations for his 2008 annual performance\nreview, which noted his strengths as (1) work ethic, (2) knowledge, and (3) quality of\nwork. A senior engineering manager and a program manager appeared as character\nwitnesses for Applicant. They praised Applicant\u2019s reliability, competence, and value to\nthe program. Of particular note was the senior engineering manager\u2019s description of the\nmeeting with Applicant to discuss the 2008 DUI offense, and the manager described\nApplicant as remorseful and disappointed in himself.   \n22\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n23\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n24\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n25\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n26\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n27\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n28\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n30\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n31\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n32\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n33\n Revised Guidelines at p. 15. \n34\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n28\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n29\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n30\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.31\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.32\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met\n33\nthe strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security\nclearance.\nAnalysis\nThe alcohol consumption and criminal conduct concerns will be discussed\ntogether because the record shows the concerns are factually related or connected to\neach other. Under Guideline G, the general concern is that \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol\nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to\ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\u201d  Under Guideline J, the general concern is \u201c[c]riminal activity creates\n34\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it\n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 21. \n35\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 15\u201316 and 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concerns and all the disqualifying and\n36\nmitigating conditions). \n7\ncalls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d35\nUnder the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct guidelines,  the following\n36\ndisqualifying conditions are raised by the record:\nAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as\nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\nA single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \nAllegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \nIndividual is currently on parole or probation. \nThe guidelines also provide that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate\nthe concerns. The following mitigating conditions are raised by the record: \nThe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \nThere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement. \nThe record contains substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol\nconsumption and two alcohol-related incidents that resulted in law-enforcement action.\nTaken together, the 1999 citation for drinking in public and the 2008 DUI demonstrate\nthat Applicant would, from time to time, drink to excess during business trips away from\nhome. It caught up with him on these two occasions. Currently, he is about 5 months\ninto a 12-month pretrial diversion program for the 2008 DUI. Although this is not parole\nor probation, which typically follow a conviction and sentence, it is similar in character\nbecause it is lawful supervision imposed pursuant to a prosecution in state court.\nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s drinking-and-driving is viewed with extreme disfavor because it is\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 1\u20132. \n37\n8\na high-risk activity that endangers the public, which shows a serious lack of good\njudgment. Simply put, a man of his age and experience should know better. \nThe record contains substantial evidence of successful reform and rehabilitation.\nTo start, Applicant is addressing his alcohol-related issues in a mature and serious way.\nThis is established by his abstinence from alcohol since April 2008, a period of about 15\nmonths when the record closed. He has not received a diagnosis or evaluation of\nalcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, or alcoholism. Likewise, he was not required to\nattend alcohol counseling, treatment, or a rehabilitation program, and he was not\nrequired to  participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or a similar organization. Taken\ntogether, these circumstances strongly suggest that Applicant does not have an alcohol\nproblem that requires further attention. \nThe criminal conduct is now resolved for the most part as well. In February 2009,\nApplicant accepted responsibility for his misconduct by agreeing to enter the pretrial\ndiversion program and admitting that he was guilty as charged. Although he will be in\nthe program until February 2010, the concern here is lessened because there are clear\nindications that Applicant has addressed his issues with alcohol (the basis for the\ncriminal conduct) and they are resolved and under control. Given these circumstances,\nit is likely that Applicant will successfully complete the pretrial diversion program\nresulting in dismissing the charges with prejudice. This means disposing of the charges\nand barring any future action on the charges. \nApplicant also has a good employment record. This is shown by his record of\nperformance as well as by the endorsements and support he received from company\nemployees. These are professional people who work in the defense industry and are\nlikely to be careful when making such endorsements.  \nI also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept, which requires\nan administrative judge to evaluate a person\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the\nperson\u2019s conduct and all the surrounding circumstances. An administrative judge should\nconsider the nine factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.  \n37\nApplicant is a mature, experienced, and successful professional. By itself, the\n1999 citation for drinking in public is of little, if any, security significance. Combined with\nthe 2008 DUI, however, the two incidents raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment.\nCurrently, he has made substantial progress in addressing these issues, as shown by a\n\nSee Tr. 50. \n38\n Revised Guidelines at p. 3. \n39\n9\npattern of abstinence for 15 months. At the hearing, Applicant impressed me as a\nserious individual who has a firm grasp on his situation and who is focused on fulfilling\nhis family and work responsibilities.  On balance, I am persuaded that (1) there is little\n38\nto no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, and (2) there is little to no\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence of similar problems.  \nIn addition to the whole-person concept, there are additional factors to consider.\nBecause Applicant is currently eligible for access to classified information, it is proper to\nconsider if he (1) voluntarily reported the information, (2) was truthful and complete in\nresponding to questions, (3) sought assistance and followed professional guidance, (4)\nresolved or appears likely to favorably resolve the security concern, and (5) has\ndemonstrated positive changes in behavior and employment.  Factors (1), (2), (4), and\n39\n(5) weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor; factor (3) is inapplicable given the facts here. These four\nfactors further support a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related issues are in the\npast and will not be of concern in the future. \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines G and J. Applicant met his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.b:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.     \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in the Paragraph 1 of the SOR. She supplied numerous documents in support of her request for a security clearance. Applicant is 54 years old and unmarried. She has two grown children. She completed more than three years of college. Since September 2007, she has worked as a resource analyst for a federal contractor. Before this position, she had worked in private industry in the area of accounting for a number of years, earning a good salary. (Item 4) In January 2006, Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 relocated from one state to another, in order to start an automotive transportation business, purchase a home and get married. Subsequently, they invested in an expensive truck and incurred other business expenses. Six months after starting the business, her fianc\u00e9 became seriously ill and could not work. In September 2006, she found employment, but was unable to manage the medical and household bills on her salary, in addition to the outstanding business expenses. In order to pay the bills, she borrowed from her retirement account and put the house on the market, hoping for a sale. Despite a $100,000 investment in the house, she was unable to obtain a home equity loan because of the outstanding business debts. (Item 4 at 16-17) In May 2007, her fianc\u00e9 died of a brain tumor. Her house is still on the market. In September 2007, Applicant began a position with her current employer. Initially her ",

Applicant received the \nFORM on April 7, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit \nadditional information. On May 5, 2009, Applicant submitted exhibits to which \nDepartment counsel had no objection. On May 15, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to \nanother administrative judge and re-assigned it to me on July 7, 2009. After receiving \nthe file, I marked Applicant\u2019s exhibits as AE A through G and entered them into the \nrecord. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nthe Paragraph 1 of the SOR. She supplied numerous documents in support of her \nrequest for a security clearance.   \n  \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and unmarried. She has two grown children. She \ncompleted more than three years of college. Since September 2007, she has worked as \na resource analyst for a federal contractor. Before this position, she had worked in \nprivate industry in the area of accounting for a number of years, earning a good salary. \n(Item 4) \n \n \nIn January 2006, Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 relocated from one state to another, in \norder to start an automotive transportation business, purchase a home and get married. \nSubsequently, they invested in an expensive truck and incurred other business \nexpenses. Six months after starting the business, her fianc\u00e9 became seriously ill and \ncould not work. In September 2006, she found employment, but was unable to manage \nthe medical and household bills on her salary, in addition to the outstanding business \nexpenses. In order to pay the bills, she borrowed from her retirement account and put \nthe house on the market, hoping for a sale. Despite a $100,000 investment in the \nhouse, she was unable to obtain a home equity loan because of the outstanding \nbusiness debts. (Item 4 at 16-17) In May 2007, her fianc\u00e9 died of a brain tumor. Her \nhouse is still on the market. \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant began a position with her current employer. Initially \nher salary was $54,000; as of September 2008, it rose to $70,000. According to a \nDecember 2008 budget, her net monthly income is $3,252 and expenses are $1,430. \nShe pays about $1,770 in financial obligations, leaving a small remainder. She has \nconsulted with a credit consolidation firm to help establish an affordable plan to resolve \nher delinquent debts. (Item 6 at 2)   \n \n \n \nBased on a credit bureau report (CBR), dated August 18, 2008, the SOR alleged \nsix delinquent debts, totaling $59,056, two of which are related to personal \nexpenditures, and four of which relate to the operation of failed automotive transport \nbusiness. The status of the debts is as follows:  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $7,836 debt owed to a credit card company. Applicant is \nnegotiating a resolution. (AE A)  \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $6,317 debt owed to the credit card company listed \nabove. She is negotiating a resolution. (AE A)  \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $13,751 debt owed to a credit card company. She \nnegotiated a resolution and began making monthly payments of $375 at the \nend of February 2009. She anticipates that the debt will be paid by October \n2012. (AE E, F, G)  \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $20,543 debt owed to a credit card company. She is \nnegotiating a resolution of the debt. (AE A)  \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $9,603 debt owed on an automobile repossession. She \nhas been making monthly payments of $200 since September 2008. The \naccount is in good standing. (AE D)  \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $1,006 debt owed to a telephone company. She paid the \ndebt in December 2008. (AE A, C) \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant resolved three of the six debts and is negotiating \nresolutions for the remaining three.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations are \nset out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n AG & 19 sets forth nine conditions that could raise security concerns, two of \nwhich are potentially disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nBased on a CBR and her admission, Applicant began accumulating a significant \namount of debt in 2007 that she has been unable to satisfy until late 2008. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these two disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets \nforth six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties, three of which may be applicable: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and, \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nBetween 2006 and 2007, Applicant encountered circumstances that were clearly \nbeyond her control and resulted in her incurring a significant amount of debt, viz., the \ndeath of her fianc\u00e9 and a failed business endeavor. She unsuccessfully attempted to \nmanage the debt by withdrawing monies from her retirement funds and applying for a \nhome equity loan. Hence, AG & 20(b) applies. Applicant presented evidence that she \nsought credit counseling and established a repayment plan for two debts, on which she \nhas made a couple payments. She paid one debt in December 2008. Hence, she \ndemonstrated a good-faith effort to repay three debts and is trying to resolve the \nremaining three. Her actions are sufficient to trigger the application of AG & 20(c) and \nAG & 20(d).  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 54-year-old woman, \nwho encountered a series of devastating personal and economic setbacks in 2007. \nDespite those difficulties, she has taken significant steps to address the resulting \ndelinquent debt and manage her finances, demonstrating her reliability and good \njudgment. In addition, she has a job that affords her the financial means to continue \npaying her obligations. Based on her awareness of the effect that future financial \ndelinquencies could have on her employment, I do not believe similar problems will \nrecur. There is no other adverse information in the record file that raises a security \nconcern. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Minster, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nC. Joel Van Over, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 23, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 24, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan\n\n2\nMetz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal:  whether certain factual findings made by\nthe Judge are supported by the record evidence, whether the Judge properly considered evidence in\nmitigation, and whether the Judge properly analyzed the case under the whole-person concept.  For\nthe following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant obtained his first clearance in\nOctober 1997, and it was renewed in May 2003 after a periodic reinvestigation.  He handled\nclassified information as necessary, without incident.  Most of his work was for one government\nagency.  From 1997 to 2005, Applicant took government computer equipment from his workplace\nwithout authorization.  He was aware of the requirement to have a property pass to take government\nequipment out of the building.  Applicant mostly took government equipment home to familiarize\nhimself with it to better perform his work.  He usually returned the equipment within a few weeks,\nbut in some instances kept it longer when it became apparent that the equipment was not going to\nbe used in his work.  Applicant generally did not use the equipment for personal reasons, but did use\na digital camera to take family pictures.  Applicant also took home items the government agency had\nthrown in the trash, including compact discs, video discs, and an unopened copy of reinstallation\nsoftware.  The misuse of government property came to light when Applicant underwent polygraph\nexaminations in 2005.  The polygraphs were initiated as a result of Applicant\u2019s company nominating\nhim to work on a contract with a different government agency, Agency 2.  During the polygraphs,\nApplicant disclosed the misuse of government property as well as a history, from 1990 to 2005, of\ndamaging the automobiles of persons who he considered to have driven dangerously.  Applicant did\nthe damage by \u201ckeying\u201d the exterior of the vehicles.  He has given varying estimates of the number\nof times he \u201ckeyed\u201d automobiles.  At the hearing he testified that he did this 6-10 times after earlier\nstating that he did it approximately 6-15 times.  In November 2005, Agency 2 disapproved Applicant\nfor additional access and revoked his existing access.  Agency 2 raised issues under criminal conduct\nand personal conduct stemming from the misuse of government property and the \u201ckeying\u201d incidents.\nThe agency also based its decision on its assessment that Applicant had not been candid during\nsecurity processing because he reported his misconduct in a piecemeal fashion.  In January 2006,\nApplicant requested a review of the decision, but the decision was affirmed in December 2006.  He\nwas taken off the Agency 2 contract and assigned to other contracts.  Applicant did not provide his\nfacility security officer with copies of the correspondence between him and the government agency\nconcerning the denial and revocation of his access.  In March 2007, Applicant completed another\nclearance application for his periodic investigation.  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 26(b)\nrequiring him to disclose if he had ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended,\nor revoked.  Applicant denies intending to falsify his clearance application, variously claiming that\nthe omission was an oversight or that he was only focused on the \u201cclearance\u201d aspect of the question.\nThe Judge found neither claim credible.  The March 2007 clearance application was at least the third\napplication Applicant had completed in 11 years, so he was familiar with the forms and the process.\nThe language of the question is straightforward, and Applicant answered it three months after\nreceiving the last letter from Agency 2 affirming the denial and revocation of his access.  Applicant\nnever gave his facility security officer copies of the letters from the agency, suggesting he did not\n\n3\nwant the company to know about Agency 2's action.  The company became aware of the termination\nof Applicant\u2019s clearance in November 2008, at which time it took the appropriate steps to notify\nclients that Applicant no longer had a clearance, and therefore no access.  At least one incorrect visit\nrequest was processed for Applicant prior to November 2008.  Applicant\u2019s work reference considers\nhim honest and trustworthy and recommends him for his clearance.\nThe Judge concluded that: The government established a case for disqualification under\nGuideline E, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns.  Applicant falsified his March\n2007 clearance application.  Agency 2's adverse access determination was based, in part, on\nApplicant providing disqualifying information in a piecemeal fashion.  In addition, Applicant took\ngovernment property from his workplace to his home for personal use, without authorization, and\nwithout returning it in a timely manner.  He also engaged in vigilante vandalism for about 15 years.\nThere are two separate, but intertwined, threads of disqualifying conduct.  First, Applicant has\nshown his willingness to hide adverse information from the government.  Second is Applicant\u2019s\nwillingness to decide for himself what government requirements and societal norms he will follow.\nBoth forms of misconduct ceased in 2005 when they surfaced during his polygraph examinations.\nApplicant has handled classified information without incident since 1997.  His work reference\nconsiders him trustworthy and reliable.  However, this favorable information is inadequate to\novercome the adverse implications of his misconduct under Guideline E or to warrant a favorable\nresult under a whole-person analysis.\n \nApplicant argues that substantial record evidence undercuts the Judge\u2019s finding that\nApplicant intentionally falsified his 2007 security clearance application.  He states his position that\nhe believed that he was only denied additional access to work on specific contracts of Agency 2, and\nhis security clearance was not denied or revoked.  He states that he believed the question was only\nasking about denials and revocations of a security clearance, and therefore did not address issues of\naccess.  Applicant asserts that his response was the product of oversight and that he misunderstood\nthe question.  Applicant objects to the Judge\u2019s consideration of the fact that he had filled out security\nclearance applications before as an impermissible \u201cshifting of the burden\u201d to him.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony about the circumstances surrounding his answering Question 26(b)\non his security clearance application, and his testimony about his state of mind at the time and what\nhe reasonably believed were all matters that the Judge was required to consider.  However, the Judge\nwas also required to evaluate critically this evidence in light of all the other evidence in the record.\nConsidering the totality of the record evidence in this case, including evidence that sheds light on\nApplicant\u2019s overall credibility, the Judge was not obliged to accept Applicant\u2019s version of events,\nnor was he required as a matter of law to find ultimately that Applicant\u2019s erroneous answer to the\nquestion was unintentional.  Applicant has given varying explanations for why he answered the\nquestion the way he did, and they are not all consistent with one another.  For example, Applicant\u2019s\nassertion that the requirement to complete the application hurriedly prevented him from reading the\nquestion carefully and therefore his mistake was a product of oversight does not completely square\nwith his claim that he misunderstood the question and thought it referred only to clearances as\nopposed to access, a response that suggests some forethought in the response process.  The totality\n\n4\nof the explanations and the extent to which they were inconsistent was a factor that the Judge\nreasonably considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility and ultimately his state of mind.  Another\nfactor considered by the Judge was the plain wording of Question 26(b), which requires disclosure\nof a denial, suspension, or revocation of an access authorization as well as a clearance.  Thus,\nApplicant\u2019s belief that he was only denied access, as opposed to losing his clearance, would not\nprovide a satisfactory explanation for why he answered the question the way he did. The Judge also\nproperly considered Applicant\u2019s written appeal to Agency 2 following the denial of access and the\nproximity of the appeal process to Applicant\u2019s execution of his security clearance application.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s consideration of the fact that he had filled out security\nclearance applications before improperly shifted the burden of persuasion on the issue of\nfalsification to Applicant.  Applicant fails to explain adequately how the Judge\u2019s consideration of\nthis factor, which was just one of numerous factors that the Judge properly considered in resolving\nthe falsification issue, served to improperly shift the burden. The Judge\u2019s consideration of\nApplicant\u2019s prior experience in dealing with security clearance applications when assessing his state\nof mind was not error.  \nThe Judge did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations as to why his incorrect answer was\nthe result of inadvertence, as opposed to deliberate action.  A Judge\u2019s credibility determination is\nentitled to deference on appeal.  Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Here, the Judge relied in part on the\nassessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility made by Agency 2 in making his own negative credibility\nassessment.  He also relied on other factors, such as Applicant\u2019s varying explanations for his answer\nto Question 26(b), his level of experience with applications, and the wording of the question.  The\nJudge\u2019s adverse credibility determination is reasonably supported by the record, as is his\ndetermination that Applicant falsified  his answer to Question 26(b).\nApplicant asserts that the Judge failed to consider exculpatory and mitigation-related\nevidence and failed to conduct a reasoned analysis of same.  Applicant contends that this\ndeleteriously affected his whole-person analysis and his decision as a whole.  Applicant also states\nthat the Judge committed error by not providing a detailed analysis of the whole-person factors.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments fail to establish error on the part of the Judge.    \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence is the record unless he specifically\nstates otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No.\n07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant fails to establish that the Judge ignored\nsignificant record evidence or did not give sufficient consideration to matters in mitigation.  Also,\na Judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence in making a decision.  Of\ncourse, the Judge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a\nreasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\nISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun.\n22, 2004).  After a review of the entire record and the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge provided sufficient detail in his analysis of the case, and did not neglect significant\nportions of the record in his decision.    \n \n\n5\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\nfactors.  Th Judge properly considered the whole pattern of Applicant\u2019s conduct, which included\nmisuse of government property, falsification, and vandalism in reaching his ultimate conclusion in\nthe case.  He adequately discussed why the disqualifying conduct established under Guideline E was\nnot mitigated.  \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.

    "judges_findings_of_fact": ": Applicant obtained his first clearance in October 1997, and it was renewed in May 2003 after a periodic reinvestigation. He handled classified information as necessary, without incident. Most of his work was for one government agency. From 1997 to 2005, Applicant took government computer equipment from his workplace without authorization. He was aware of the requirement to have a property pass to take government equipment out of the building. Applicant mostly took government equipment home to familiarize himself with it to better perform his work. He usually returned the equipment within a few weeks, but in some instances kept it longer when it became apparent that the equipment was not going to be used in his work. Applicant generally did not use the equipment for personal reasons, but did use a digital camera to take family pictures. Applicant also took home items the government agency had thrown in the trash, including compact discs, video discs, and an unopened copy of reinstallation software. The misuse of government property came to light when Applicant underwent polygraph examinations in 2005. The polygraphs were initiated as a result of Applicant\u2019s company nominating him to work on a contract with a different government agency, Agency 2. During the polygraphs, Applicant disclosed the misuse of government property as well as a history, from 1990 to 2005, of damaging the automobiles of persons who he considered to have driven dangerously. Applicant did the damage by \u201ckeying\u201d the exterior of the vehicles. He has given varying estimates of the number of times he \u201ckeyed\u201d automobiles. At the hearing he testified that he did this 6-10 times after earlier stating that he did it approximately 6-15 times. In November 2005, Agency 2 disapproved Applicant for additional access and revoked his existing access. Agency 2 raised issues under criminal conduct and personal conduct stemming from the misuse of government property and the \u201ckeying\u201d incidents. The agency also based its decision on its assessment that Applicant had not been candid during security processing because he reported his misconduct in a piecemeal fashion. In January 2006, Applicant requested a review of the decision, but the decision was affirmed in December 2006. He was taken off the Agency 2 contract and assigned to other contracts. Applicant did not provide his facility security officer with copies of the correspondence between him and the government agency concerning the denial and revocation of his access. In March 2007, Applicant completed another clearance application for his periodic investigation. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 26(b) requiring him to disclose if he had ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked. Applicant denies intending to falsify his clearance application, variously claiming that the omission was an oversight or that he was only focused on the \u201cclearance\u201d aspect of the question. The Judge found neither claim credible. ",

Applicant timely answered, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n2\nassigned the case to me 31 August 2009, and I convened a hearing 29 September\n2009. DOHA received the transcript 7 October 2009.\nSeptember 24, 2010\n\nThe government clearance database contained in AE B records only the dates of background investigations,\n3\nsubsequent adjudications of those investigations, the level of clearance granted, and terminations of\nclearances, either administratively or for cause. The database does not record access to classified information.\nEach agency makes its own assessment of whether an individual should be given access to classified\ninformation, and at what level. Agencies are also the sole arbiters of which individuals should be given special\nor additional access to information designated for greater protection than that provided by the basic\nclassifications.\nGovernment computer systems generally are delivered with the necessary software, particularly the operating\n4\nsystems, pre-loaded. The government purchases a license to use each copy of the software, which frequently\nmeans that multiple copies of the reinstallation discs are delivered with the computer systems. Government\ntechnical support is such that the discs are seldom needed.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.f. He is a 42-year-old\npractice technical lead employed by a defense contractor since October 1996. He seeks\nreinstatement of the security clearance he has held since October 1997.\nApplicant graduated from college in May 1985. He married in October 1989, and\nhas two children, ages 17 and 14. \nAfter Applicant went to work for his employer in October 1996, he applied for his\nfirst clearance, which he obtained in October 1997. In January 2002, he was subject to\nperiodic reinvestigation, and his clearance was renewed in May 2003 (AE B).  He\n3\nhandled classified information, as necessary, without incident.\nAfter Applicant\u2019s clearance was granted in October 1997, most of his work was\nfor one government agency. From 1997 to 2005, Applicant took government computer\nequipment from his workplace without authorization. He was aware of the requirement\nto have a property pass to take government equipment out of the building because he\nhad obtained property passes in the past to take government equipment to trade shows.\nApplicant initially gave no reason for his failure to get authorization (Tr. 43-44), but later\non he realized no one ever checked to see if he had a property pass (Tr. 49).\nApplicant mostly took government equipment home to familiarize himself with it\nto better perform his work. He usually returned the equipment within a few weeks, but in\nsome instances kept it much longer when it became apparent that the equipment was\nnot going to be used in his work. Applicant generally did not use the equipment for\npersonal reasons, but did use a digital camera to take family pictures. Applicant\nestimates he took home over $1,300 worth of government property.\nApplicant also took home items the government agency had thrown in the trash:\ncompact discs and video discs, some with non-sensitive test data on them, some blank.\nHe took home an unopened copy of reinstallation software that had also been thrown in\nthe trash.  He had the same operating system on his home computer, and while he had\n4\na valid license for his software, his reinstallation disc was defective. He used the\n\n3\ngovernment-purchased software to reload the program on his computer, using his valid\nlicense to register the program with the software company.\nThis misuse of government property came to light when Applicant underwent a\npolygraph examination in June 2005. While Applicant\u2019s work with the original\ngovernment agency was wrapping up in 2004, his company nominated him to work on a\ncontract with a different government agency, one which required its contractors to pass\na lifestyle polygraph before receiving final approval for the additional access needed to\nwork on the contract. This agency did not schedule Applicant\u2019s polygraph until June\n2005. The initial polygraph raised some issues that the agency wanted to address, and\nhe was polygraphed again a week later.\nDuring the polygraphs, Applicant disclosed the misuse of government property\ndescribed above as well as a lengthy history of mild \u201croad rage\u201d incidents. From 1990 to\n2005, Applicant \u201ckeyed\u201d the automobiles of drivers who Applicant considered to have\ndriven dangerously. He did this only when the offending driver parked in the same\nparking lot as Applicant; he never followed the drivers to a different location from where\nhe was heading. Applicant has given varying estimates of the number of times he\n\u201ckeyed\u201d automobiles. The polygrapher recorded 6-15 times\u2014the number alleged in the\nSOR\u2014most recently about a month before his polygraph. Applicant unequivocally\nadmitted this allegation. However, during a subject interview in June 2007, Applicant\nstated fewer than 10 times as a more accurate number (GE 3). At hearing, he testified\nthat 6-10 times was a more accurate number (Tr. 67).\nIn November 2005, the government agency disapproved Applicant for additional\naccess and revoked his existing access (GE 2). The agency raised issues under\ncriminal conduct and personal conduct. The agency specified the misconduct cited\nabove, as well as the agency\u2019s assessment that Applicant had not been candid during\nsecurity processing because Applicant reported his misconduct in a piecemeal manner.\nIn January 2006, Applicant requested review of the decision, but the decision was\naffirmed in December 2006. Applicant did not file a second-level appeal. He was taken\noff the agency contract and assigned to other contracts. It does not appear that\nApplicant\u2019s company security office was aware of, or involved in, this reassignment.\nApplicant did not provide his facility security officer (FSO) with copies of the\ncorrespondence between him and the government agency concerning the denial and\nrevocation of his access (Tr. 108).\nThe government\u2019s clearance database (AE B) administratively terminated his\nclearance in March 2007 for loss of jurisdiction, i.e., no longer employed in a job\nrequiring a clearance. Although the entry shows that it was an incident report\nadjudication, there is no evidence to conclusively connect the administrative termination\nof Applicant\u2019s clearance with the agency adjudications of his access to agency\ninformation.\nIn March 2007, Applicant completed another clearance application for his\nperiodic reinvestigation (GE 1). Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to a question (26b) requiring\n\n4\nhim to disclose if he had ever had a clearance or access authorization denied,\nsuspended, or revoked. Applicant denies intending to falsify his clearance application,\nvariously claiming that the omission was an \u201coversight\u201d (Tr. 86) or that he was only\nfocused on the \u201cclearance\u201d aspect of the question (Tr. 93). I find neither claim credible.\nThe March 2007 clearance application was at least his third such application in 11\nyears, so he was well familiar with the forms and the process. The language of the\nquestion is straightforward, and Applicant answered it three months after receiving the\nlast letter from the agency affirming the denial and revocation of his access. Finally,\nApplicant never gave his FSO copies of those letters, suggesting that he did not want\nthe company to know of the agency action.\nThe company did not become aware of the termination of Applicant\u2019s clearance\nuntil November 2008, when his FSO noticed the database entry while processing a\nroutine visit request. The FSO took the appropriate steps to notify the appropriate\nclients that Applicant no longer had a clearance, and therefore no longer had access,\nbut it appears that at least one incorrect visit request was processed before November\n2008.\nApplicant\u2019s work reference considers him honest and trustworthy, and\nrecommends him for his clearance (Tr. 139-146). He considers the misconduct noted in\nthe SOR inconsistent with what he knows of Applicant. Applicant advised him of the\nmisconduct the week before the hearing (Tr. 146).\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to be used to evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and\nsituation presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense\nconsideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, specific\nguidelines should be followed where a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a clearance. Considering the\nSOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline is\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nAs no one has a right to a clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n\u00b616 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n6\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . .

Applicant falsified his March 2007\nclearance application by failing to disclose that another government agency denied and\nrevoked his special access to that agency\u2019s information in December 2006. The\nagency\u2019s adverse access determination was based, in part, on Applicant providing\ndisqualifying information in a piecemeal fashion.  In addition, Applicant took government\n6\nproperty from his workplace to his home for personal use, without authorization, and\nwithout returning it in a timely manner. He also engaged in vigilante vandalism for about\n15 years.  Thus, the burden of persuasion shifted to Applicant to refute or mitigate the\n7\ngovernment\u2019s information. \nThere are two separate, but intertwined, threads of disqualifying conduct. First,\nApplicant has shown his willingness to hide adverse information from the Government\nby falsifying his March 2007 clearance application. This misconduct cannot be\nconsidered an aberration because it occurs against the background of having not made\ncomplete disclosure of information during his polygraph examinations, his failing to\ndisclose the agency access determination to his company clearance office, and his\nwaiting until the week before the hearing to disclose the SOR allegations to his\ncharacter witness.\nThe other disqualifying thread is Applicant\u2019s willingness to decide for himself what\ngovernment requirements and societal norms he will follow\u2014in effect substituting his\n\nHowever, I consider the electronic media and computer program taken from the trash can as having been\n8\nabandoned by the government agency, and thus not indicative of any misconduct by Applicant.  Nevertheless,\nthe other government property taken by Applicant is enough to warrant denial of his clearance.\n6\njudgment. He misappropriated government equipment.  He determined for himself\n8\nwhich \u201cdangerous\u201d drivers were to be punished by his vigilante vandalism\u2014itself minor\ncriminal conduct. I have considered that both forms of misconduct ceased in 2005 when\nit surfaced during his polygraph examinations, that he has handled classified\ninformation without incident since his first clearance in 1997, and that his work reference\nconsiders him trustworthy and reliable. However, I find this favorable information\ninadequate to overcome the adverse implications of his misconduct under Guideline E\nor to warrant a favorable result under a whole-person analysis. I resolve Guideline E\nagainst Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

In March 2006, he was \nhospitalized after he attempted suicide during a manic episode. He drove his car \napproximately 120 miles per hour head on into another vehicle in traffic. He was \nhospitalized in a mental health ward for approximately five days. Sometime later that \nmonth he was diagnosed by Dr. B, a clinical psychologist, with bipolar disorder, and \nserious depression, chronic in nature. Dr. B, when questioned by an Office of Personnel \n(OPM) investigator, \u201cresponded affirmatively when asked whether [Applicant\u2019s] condition \ncould impair his judgment or reliability.\u201d He explained to the OPM investigator that \nbipolar disorder generally is considered a serious, chronic condition that has to be \ncontrolled with medication.\u201d2 When Applicant was released from the hospital, he was \ntold to follow up his treatment in a mental health program. He was given an appointment \nfor a mental health program. He was given discharge information and a note to provide \nto his employer that he should be excused from work for two weeks. Applicant did not \nfollow-up. Applicant testified that he did not recall the hospital recommending he go to \nmental health treatment. He stated he did not enter a program because he had other \npriorities at the time, such as his children and his job.3 \n \n \n1 Tr. 89-93-95. \n \n2 Tr. 29, 39-46; GE 1, 7. \n \n3 Tr. 39-46; GE 7. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was treated by Dr. B from approximately March 2006 to \nMay 2006. In the results of interview of Dr. B by the OPM investigator, he stated he had \nonly seen Applicant one time for short duration.4 \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant was hospitalized due in part to his bipolar disorder. \nApplicant stated he did not recall the specific problems he was having at the time, but \nremembered he lost his zeal for life, was depressed, and had difficulty focusing. The \nhospital discharge summary stated: Applicant was suicidal with thoughts of drowning \nhimself; his girlfriend told doctors and medical staff that he voiced suicidal thoughts \nmore than once, and he has stopped taking his medication.5 He signed himself out of \nthe hospital against medical advice for further inpatient psychiatric treatment. He stated \nhe did this because he feared he would lose his job. He did not recall the name of the \ndoctor he saw. He does not recall how often he sought mental health counseling. \nApplicant did not seek mental health treatment again until July 2007.6  \n \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant sought treatment at a hospital and started therapy. He did \nnot start therapy before then because he had other priorities in his life. He did not feel \nlike medication would help him. He was focused on his job and taking care of his family. \nHe stated he started therapy after he completed his security clearance application on \nJuly 27, 2007.7 In October 2007, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. C and diagnosed with \nbipolar disorder, nonspecific NOS, and prescribed medication. He recalled telling Dr. C \nthat he was concerned that his security clearance might be denied due to his mental \nhealth. The results of interview of Dr. C by OPM on October 24, 2007 stated: \n\u201c[Applicant] is stable and on medication. [Applicant] is not having mood swings now. \n[Applicant] is on medication now and intends to continue treatment. His prognosis is \ngood if he stays on his medication and continues treatment.\u201d8 In response to \ninterrogatories requesting if Dr. C had any additional information to provide he stated:  \n \nWhen I said he has a condition that \u201ccould\u201d impair his judgment, I meant \nthat if he did not follow up with treatment recommendations his symptoms \ncould recur. As long as he continues follow-up [and] treatment (until his \npsychiatrist says it\u2019s no longer necessary) the prognosis is good [and] he \ncan be expected to function in a stable, productive way.9 \n \nApplicant stated he believed he was counseled by Dr. C once a month from July \n2007 to December 2007. \n                                                          \n4 GE 9. \n \n5 GE 6, 7. \n \n6 Tr 46-54. \n \n7 Tr. 50-62. \n \n8 Tr. 62-64; GE 10. \n \n9 GE 10. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nDr. F provided a statement to the OPM investigator. He noted that Applicant first \nsought treatment in 2006, and had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Applicant was \nreferred to him from the hospital, but Dr. F had only one appointment with him in \nDecember 2007. Applicant came to Dr. F\u2019s office for medication, which was prescribed. \nNo other treatment was provided by Dr. F, and he was uncertain if Applicant was \nattending individual therapy at the time. Dr. F stated that Applicant had a history of \nnoncompliance and had canceled appointments with him. He had tried several \nmedications; but Applicant did not always take his medications. He opined that there \nwas a very high potential for Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder to impair his judgment and \nreliability and his prognosis was guarded.10 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that on about November 1, 2007, he told a licensed clinical \nsocial worker at a hospital that he wanted a \u201cquick fix\u201d to his mental health problem and \nhe was unsure of the need for individual therapy. Applicant explained that at times he \nfelt really bad on the medication that was prescribed to him, and he was told it would \nmake him feel worse before he felt better. He found it difficult to deal with because he \nhad a family, a job, and children to support.11 \n \nApplicant began seeing Dr. D in 2008. He believes he saw him about two to three \ntimes that year. Applicant could not recall the specific periods of time he saw different \ndoctors. He was not receiving any other therapy, other than the two to three visits with \nDr. D in 2008. Dr. D provided a statement in June 2008. It stated: \n \n[Applicant] does have major affective disorder (bipolar). He has been \nhospitalized [three] times. The first stay was October 2006. He is now \nstabilized for a year in outpatient treatment. He is compliant on only one \nmedication and has an excellent prognosis.12  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he stopped taking his medications in June 2008, when the \nprescription ran out. He did not attempt to have it refilled. He stopped taking the \nmedications about the same time Dr. D provided the above statement. Applicant was \nnot told to stop taking his medication by Dr. D. He testified that he stopped taking it \nbecause he decided he did not need it any longer. Dr. D did not make a determination \nthat Applicant no longer needed medication.13  \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant was directed by DOHA to be examined by a \npsychiatric consultant for the Department of Defense.14 On October 4, 2008, Dr. G, a \n \n10 GE 11. \n \n11 Tr. 29-30. \n \n12 GE 8.  \n \n13 Tr. 65-79. \n \n14 AE 13. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nboard certified psychiatrist interviewed Applicant and reviewed his medical record.15 He \nstated:  \n \nIn my professional opinion there is evidence of [an] emotional, mental, \npersonality disorder which I diagnose as Bipolar Disorder Type I. It is of \ncontinuing nature. It is not now causing significant defect in judgment or \nreliability. It may cause such defect in the future. It is not causing \nsignificant defect in psychological, social, or occupational functioning. It \nmay cause such defect in the future. The illness is in remission at this \ntime. The probability of recurrence is moderate.16  \n \nApplicant saw Dr. E, a psychiatrist on May 3, 2010, to obtain another opinion. \nApplicant wanted to see him in anticipation of issues raised regarding him obtaining a \nsecurity clearance. He had not been treated by Dr. E previously. Applicant believed his \nappointment was about an hour long and Dr. E reviewed his medical records and \ninterviewed him. Dr. E stated:  \n \nAlthough it is typical for patients with Bipolar Disorder to have frequent \nrelapses, especially if not taking psychoactive medications. [Applicant] has \nnot demonstrated any symptoms of relapse since December 2007. He \ncontinued without symptoms since June 2008, when all psychoactive \nmedications were discontinued. This clinical course would argue against \nBipolar Disorder. It is possible that [Applicant] had a Brief Psychotic \nEpisode or Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features. \nRegardless of the exact diagnosis, [Applicant] has not been symptomatic \nfor greater than 2 years, 23 months of those 2 years, thus far, off \nmedication. [Applicant\u2019s] reliability and judgment appear to intact and \nsound.17 \n \n \nApplicant returned to see Dr. E on December 13, 2010, in anticipation of his \nsecurity clearance hearing. Applicant stated their appointment was about 15 minutes \nlong. Applicant had not had any appointments or therapy since meeting with him in May \n2010, for an evaluation. Dr. E provided the following statement: \n \nThis is an update to my memo of May 3, 2010. I saw [Applicant] for a \nfollow up appointment tonight. He remains without any signs or symptoms \nof Bipolar Disorder. I continue to support his pursuit of a security \nclearance.18 \n \n \n15 Tr. 87-89. \n \n16 GE 14.  \n \n17 Tr. 67-69, 93-95; GE 15.  \n \n18 AE C. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant stated that he decided that after he received \u201ctalk\u201d therapy with Dr. D \nand Dr. E, another psychiatrist, he had addressed his underlying psychological issues. \nHe concluded the \u201ctalk\u201d therapy helped and he did not need any further therapy.19  \n \n \nWhen asked directly if Applicant believed he had a bipolar disorder, he stated he \ndid not. He confirmed that he does not take medication because he does not believe he \nneeds them. He concurred that three doctors have diagnosed him with bipolar \ndisorder.20  \n \n \nBipolar disorder is also known as a manic-depressive illness. It is a brain disorder \nthat causes shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out day-to-day \ntasks. Symptoms are severe, but can be treated. It is a long-term illness that must be \ncarefully managed throughout a person\u2019s life. There is no cure for bipolar disorder.21  \n \n \nBecause bipolar disorder is a lifelong and recurrent illness, people with the \ndisorder need long-term treatment to maintain control of bipolar \nsymptoms. An effective maintenance treatment plan includes medication \nand psychotherapy for preventing relapse and reducing symptom \nseverity.22 \n \nApplicant completed his security clearance application on July 26, 2007. In \nresponse to section 21 which asked if he had in the last seven years consulted with a \nmental health professional or another health care provider about a mental health related \ncondition, Applicant answered \u201cyes.\u201d Applicant listed he had been treated by Dr. B from \nJuly 2006 to August 2006. He failed to fully disclose the extent of his mental health \nissues, including his inpatient and outpatient treatment for bipolar disorder, his suicidal \nepisode and hospitalization in March 2006, his July 2006 hospitalization, his August \n2006 mental health assessment at a hospital, and his February 2007 outpatient \ntreatment for bipolar disorder. \n \n \nApplicant denied he deliberately failed to disclose his prior mental health \nproblems. He stated he completed the SCA to the best of his ability, and because he did \nnot have supporting documents regarding his mental health problems, it was his best \neffort, and he answered it the best he could. He denied he failed to disclose the \ninformation because it might affect his ability to obtain a security clearance. I find \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was not credible and he deliberately failed to disclose all of his \nmental health concerns.23  \n \n19 Tr. 80-81. \n \n20 Tr. 86-89. \n \n21 National Institute of Mental Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute \nof Health: Bipolar Disorder Brochure. \n \n22 Id. \n \n23 Tr. 30-36, 39-50, 85-87. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on his behalf. Applicant has worked for him since \n2007. He considers him ambitious, trustworthy, even-tempered, pleasant to work with, \nand an asset to the team. He has never been concerned about Applicant\u2019s conduct. \nApplicant consistently performs above average and has high standards for his technical \nskills. He is considered a valuable, important employee.24  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n \n \n24 Tr. 99-105. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concern for Psychological Conditions is set out in AG & 27:  \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of seeking mental health counseling.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 28 and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but \nnot limited to emotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, \nparanoid, or bizarre behavior;  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may \nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a \ndiagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take \nprescribed medication. \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant attempted suicide during a manic episode by driving his \ncar at 120 miles per hour into two other vehicles in traffic, resulting in his hospitalization. \nHe was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and serious depression, chronic in nature. He \nneeded medication to control these issues. Applicant was released from the hospital \nand was told to follow up his treatment in a mental health program. He was given an \n\n \n9 \n \n \nappointment for a mental health program. He was given discharge information and a \nnote to provide to his employer that he should be excused from work for two weeks. \nApplicant did not follow-up. He stated he did not enter a program because he had other \npriorities at the time, such as his children and his job. I find AG \u00b6 28(a) applies  \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant was suicidal with thoughts of drowning himself; his \ngirlfriend told doctors and medical staff that he voiced suicidal thoughts more than once \nand has stopped taking his medication. He signed himself out of the hospital against \nmedical advice for further inpatient psychiatric treatment. He does not recall how often \nhe sought mental health counseling. Applicant did not seek mental health treatment \nagain until July 2007.  \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant sought treatment at a hospital and started therapy. He \nstated he did this after he completed his security clearance application on July 27, 2007. \nIn October 2007, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. C and diagnosed with bipolar disorder, \nNonspecific NOS, and prescribed medication. Dr. C considered Applicant stable. He \nindicated that Applicant was on medication at the time and that he intended to continue \ntreatment. His prognosis was good if he stayed on his medication and continued his \ntreatment. He further indicated that Applicant has a condition that could impair his \njudgment, and if he did not follow up with treatment recommendations his symptoms \ncould recur. However, as long as he continued to follow-up with treatment, until his \npsychiatrist says it is no longer necessary, the prognosis was good and he could be \nexpected to function in a stable, productive way. Applicant saw Dr. C once a month from \nJuly 2007 to December 2007. \n \nApplicant saw Dr. F one time in December 2007. He failed to keep subsequent \nappointments, has a history of noncompliance and would not take his medication as \nprescribed. He saw Dr. D two or three times in 2008. He was again diagnosed with \nbipolar disorder and appeared to be stabilized while he was taking the prescribed \nmedication. Applicant stopped taking the medication shortly after seeing Dr. D because \nApplicant determined he no longer needed it. In September 2008, he was again \ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder of a continuing nature that was in remissionby Dr. G. \nApplicant sought another diagnosis from Dr. E, who determined it is possible that \nApplicant had a brief psychotic episode or major depressive disorder with psychotic \nfeatures. \n \nApplicant has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder by different psychiatrists. It is \nnot always clear that each successive doctor that has seen or treated Applicant has \nnecessarily been aware of what treatment plan was previously prescribed, his full \npsychiatric history, and what medications he was directed to take. What is clear is that \nApplicant has repeatedly failed to follow his doctor\u2019s advice. He decided he no longer \nneeded medication so he stopped taking his medication contrary to his doctor\u2019s orders. \nHe does not believe he has bipolar disorder, despite numerous diagnoses. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n28(b) and 28(c) apply. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG & 29 and the following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amendable to treatment, and the individual \nis currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis \nby a duly qualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that the \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one \ncaused by death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been \nresolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotional \ninstability; and \n \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \n \n \nApplicant has been consistently diagnosed with a bipolar disorder since 2006 by \nmultiple psychiatrists. A U.S. Government approved psychiatrist made the diagnosis in \nSeptember 2008. He determined the condition was in remission, but the probability of \nrecurrence was moderate. Although bipolar disorder is treatable Applicant has failed to \ndemonstrate ongoing and consistent compliance with a treatment. He has periodically \nvolunteered for mental health counseling and treatment, but has an inconsistent track \nrecord in attending treatment, keeping appointments, and taking prescribed medication. \nHe decided to stop taking prescribed medications because he does not think he needs \nthem and does not concur with the diagnoses of several psychiatrists. Therefore, I find \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), 29(b), and 29(c) do not apply. There is no evidence to support application \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(d) or 29(e). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct;  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant intentionally and deliberately failed to disclose all of his hospitalizations \nand consultations with mental health professionals on his July 26, 2007 SCA. He \ndeliberately attempted to mislead the Government as to the full extent of his mental \nhealth issues, by listing he had only seen one doctor from July 2006 to August 2006, \nwhen in fact he had seen several doctors about his condition, had been prescribed \nmedication, and had been treated at other mental health facilities. His explanation for \nwhy he did not disclose all of his mental health issues was not credible. I find the above \ndisqualifying condition applies.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct his \nomission. There is no evidence Applicant\u2019s concealment and omission was caused or \ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice. The concealment and omission is \nserious because Applicant attempted to hide important facts about his mental health. \nThere is evidence he was concerned how his diagnosis would affect his ability to obtain \na security clearance. Applicant disputes his diagnosis, has failed to follow his doctor\u2019s \ntreatment plan, and has failed to be honest about his mental health issues. I find none \nof the above mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline I and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant \nwas diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2006 after a suicide attempt. He was diagnosed \nagain by different doctors with the same condition. He failed to follow-up with the \ndoctors. He stopped taking his medications because he did not think he needed to take \nthem. Applicant intentionally omitted and concealed the extent of his mental health \nissues on his SCA.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes ten delinquent debts totaling $28,869 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.k) that were incurred after he was granted a discharge in bankruptcy in 1992 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant admitted the Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in 1991 and subsequent delinquencies, which he attributed to unemployment. However, he averred that the debt balances were higher than his creditors could collect under state law. He added that the debts would be reviewed in court and those allowed to be collected would be paid (Item 4). After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owes about $28,000 in delinquent debt largely attributable to\nunemployment. Financial concerns persist because he has taken no steps to address\nthe debt despite steady employment since October 2005. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 10, 2007. On November 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\nJuly 29, 2009\n\nApplicant listed a different employer on his December 10, 2007, e-QIP.\n1\nThe records of the bankruptcy confirm a discharge date in October 1991 rather than in 1992 as\n2\nalleged in the SOR.\n2\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 29, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR on February 3, 2009, and requested a decision without a hearing. On March\n30, 2009, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of\nten exhibits (Items 1-10). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and\ninstructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. No response was received by the\nMay 14, 2009, due date. On June 11, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 4), eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\nten delinquent debts totaling $28,869 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.k) that were incurred after\nhe was granted a discharge in bankruptcy in 1992 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant admitted the\nChapter 7 bankruptcy filing in 1991 and subsequent delinquencies, which he attributed\nto unemployment. However, he averred that the debt balances were higher than his\ncreditors could collect under state law. He added that the debts would be reviewed in\ncourt and those allowed to be collected would be paid (Item 4). After considering the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old software developer with a Master of Science degree\nawarded in March 1996 (Item 5). As of December 2008, Applicant had been working as\na contractor for the U.S. Army Reserve for about six months (Item 4).  He held a top\n1\nsecret security clearance in the past, which was granted to him in December 1997 for\nhis duties with a previous employer (Item 5).\nWhile employed as a chemist at a state university, Applicant filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in early June 1991. He listed unsecured claims of $33,685.45 consisting\nprimarily of credit card debt. In late October 1991,  he was granted a discharge of his\n2\ndischargeable debts (Item 10).\nBy the late 1990s, credit was again being extended to Applicant (Item 9). In\nMarch 1997, he went to work as an associate consultant for a defense contractor. He\nopened credit card accounts in June 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), February 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.d),\nand November 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) (Item 9). He bought a computer on credit (SOR \u00b6 1.g)\n(Item 7). He took out a primary mortgage of $165,000 in August 1998, and a second\n\nApplicant told a government investigator in April 2008 that he had stopped paying on that credit card\n3\naccount until November 2002, when he was laid off by a previous employer (Item 7). His credit reports (Items\nshow discrepant last activity dates in June 2005 (Item 9) and July 2005 (Item 8), either of which could be when\nthe $2,570 debt balance was charged off.\nHis credit report of January 2008 includes two listings for the automobile loan with different high credit\n4\nlimits, $34,944 and $25,715 (Item 9). W hen he was asked about the debt in April 2008, Applicant indicated\nthat the initial balance of the truck loan was $25,000. His June 2008 credit report (Item 8) lists only the\n$25,715 high credit balance.\n3\nmortgage of $27,015 in December 1999. Both loans were repaid under agreed upon\nterms. In January 2000, he financed an automobile through a loan of $18,365. He made\nhis payments on time, and the loan was closed satisfactorily. In July 2001, he took out a\nnew automobile loan of $22,407, and he paid that loan off in December 2003 (Item 9).\nIn late 2003, he took out a new vehicle loan for the purchase of a truck (SOR \u00b6 1.f)\n(Items 7, 9).\nFollowing a job layoff, Applicant was unemployed from November 2002 until\nSeptember 2004, with the exception of April 2004 when he had a short-term contract\nassignment for the Air Force. He was the primary caregiver for his mother, who had\nAlzheimer\u2019s (Items 5, 7). In about August 2003, he incurred a medical debt of $2,300 for\nan emergency room visit. He paid $1,000 of the cost, and a $1,311 delinquent balance\nwas referred for collection in December 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) (Item 9). Applicant disputed\nthe balance with the hospital as he had been told the emergency room visit would cost\nhim $1,000 (Item 7). In September 2004, he began working for $55 an hour with a\nsubcontractor to a major computer company, but he was again laid off in late April 2005\n(Items 5, 7). Applicant collected unemployment compensation through August 2005\n(Item 7). He resided with his sister while he was out of work and she helped him\nfinancially (Items 5, 7). Already delinquent on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e  and 1.k, he\n3\nstopped paying on several other accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i) in\n2005. His vehicle was repossessed and sold at an auction, leaving him with a deficiency\nbalance of about $3,000 (Item 7).4\nApplicant returned to work in August 2005, initially in a temporary job that lasted\nonly a couple of months. In October 2005, he began employment with a software\ndeveloper. The record does not include information about his earnings with that\nemployer. He repaid a state tax debt of $2,394 to remove a lien filed against him in\nNovember 2005 (Items 7, 9). While in that job, Applicant completed his e-QIP on\nDecember 10, 2007. Applicant disclosed the repossession of his vehicle in about\nJanuary 2006 and unsecured delinquent credit card debt that he estimated at $10,000.\nHe responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts,\nalthough the debts in the SOR had not been repaid (Items 5, 7).\nApplicant was interviewed on April 18, 2008, about his delinquent debts,\nincluding the tax lien. Applicant averred he had repaid the $2,394 tax debt by March\n2006, but acknowledged that he owed the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.i and 1.k.\nHe expressed no knowledge of a $261 medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j.  He expressed his\n\n4\nintent to make installment payments on the debts and to have them resolved within the\nnext 18 months. He added that he had purchased property and a vehicle to reestablish\nhis credit and was living within his means (Item 7). Checks of Applicant\u2019s credit in April\nand June 2008 revealed that he had taken out a conventional real estate mortgage of\n$115,000 in October 2004, and a car loan of $12,856 in August 2003. He was making\nhis monthly payments of $1,370 and $246 on those loans on time. However, he also\nowed delinquent debt balances totaling $28,869 as alleged in the SOR (Items 8, 9).\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged on September 8,\n2008, that he had taken no action toward resolving his delinquent debts. He indicated\nthat only the original debt balances were collectable under state law and no actions had\nbeen taken by his creditors (Item 6). As of December 2008, Applicant continued to\nassert that the dollar amounts claimed by his creditors exceeded those legally\ncollectable under state law and that those balances that were determined by a court\nwith competent jurisdiction would be paid (Item 4).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant owes about $28,869 in delinquent debt, most of which has been\ndelinquent since 2005. One credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.e) may well have been in\ndefault since 2002. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c),\n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d are implicated.\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\ncannot reasonably be applied. While there is no evidence of new delinquency, he has\nnot shown that he has the financial means or the willingness or both to resolve his\nsubstantial delinquent debt in the near future.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies, but only in part. The evidence\nsupports his position that unemployment was a significant factor, if not the cause, in him\nfalling behind in his financial obligations. Applicant also had some unexpected medical\ncosts that led to the hospital debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate\nhis failure to act responsibly to address his debts once he was in a position to do so.\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s inaction on his consumer credit debt before March 2006 is\nunderstandable, given he was repaying a $2,394 tax debt. However, there is no\nevidence of any credible circumstances, such as a break in employment, that could\njustify his subsequent disregard of his delinquent debts. By April 2008, if not before, he\nwas put on notice that his unpaid debts were of concern to the Department of Defense.\nHe indicated in April 2008 that he would make installment payments, but there is no\nindication that he has even contacted his creditors. A good faith effort to resolve debts is\nnot met by waiting until his creditors seek court action against him. His timely payments\nof his mortgage and his newest car loan are not sufficient to overcome the considerable\ndoubts about his financial judgment. Although he is repaying his current mortgage and\ncar loans on time, he has not yet accepted that he has a fiduciary obligation to his\ncreditors. AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d and AG \u00b620(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d do not apply.\nApplicant does not challenge that the debts in the SOR are his responsibility. A\ndispute over the amount owed (e.g., the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d would be entitled to the\n$4,180 high credit balance rather than the $10,602 balance reportedly due as of June\n2008) does not invoke AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\n\n7\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). Applicant does\nnot dispute his responsibility for the credit balances originally extended to him. Yet his\nwillingness to pay those debts carries little weight in mitigation where he has elected to\nwait until the creditors pursue collection through the court. While his unemployment\nclearly had a negative impact on his fiances, he has been gainfully employed for long\nenough now to require some affirmative steps on his part to resolve his debts. Based on\nthe record before me, I cannot conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nWhile holding a security clearance for her duties with a defense contractor,\nApplicant used cocaine from January 2006 until August 2006, when she was arrested\nfor possession of cocaine and risk of injury to a minor. She relapsed twice in 2007 while\nshe was in counseling, including one time after she had completed a court-ordered\npretrial drug education program. She intends to maintain a lifestyle free of illegal drugs,\nbut the drug involvement and related personal conduct concerns are not fully mitigated.\nClearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on November 20, 2007. On May 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement, and Guideline E, personal\nconduct, that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her a security\nclearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nFebruary 25, 2010\n\nThere is nothing in the record to indicate when a hearing was requested. She did not object when\n1\nshe received the Notice of Hearing and agreed to a change in the hearing date.\n2\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on July 9, 2009, and requested a decision based\non the written record without a hearing. On August 6, 2009, the case was assigned to\nme to conduct a hearing and to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On August 12, 2009, I\n1\nscheduled a hearing for September 15, 2009. Due to a schedule change, I rescheduled\nthe hearing for September 16, 2009, with the agreement of the parties.\nI convened the hearing as rescheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and\nfive Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-E) were entered into evidence without any objections, and\nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on September 25, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement) that Applicant used cocaine\nfrom about January 2006 to at least March 2007 (SOR 1.a); that she purchased cocaine\n(SOR 1.b); that she was charged in about August 2006 with possession of cocaine and\nrisk of injury to a minor (SOR 1.c), for which she completed ten hours of drug education\nclasses and 32 hours of community service before the charges were nolled [sic] (SOR\n1.c); and that she received treatment from August 2006 to about November 2006 (SOR\n1.d), and from September 2006 to March 2008 (SOR 1.e), for diagnosed cocaine abuse.\nApplicant\u2019s use and purchase of cocaine and her arrest for possession of cocaine were\ncross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR 2.b). DOHA also alleged under Guideline E that\nApplicant used cocaine after she had been granted a security clearance in about 1994\n(SOR 2.a).\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guidelines H and E, clarifying that she\nused cocaine from January 2006 to August 2006, and relapsed twice, once in January\n2007 and once in March 2007. Applicant denied the implication that she was unreliable\nand untrustworthy because of her illegal drug involvement, and averred that she was\ncompletely truthful on her security clearance paperwork and during her subject\ninterview. She maintained she had been abstinent for the past two plus years and\nintended to maintain that lifestyle. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntranscript, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old senior electrical engineer who has worked for her\nemployer, a defense contractor, since February 1988, when she was still pursuing her\nundergraduate degree. She seeks to retain the secret security clearance that she has\nheld since October 1994 (Ex. 1).\n\nThe date of her daughter\u2019s birth is incorrect on the e-QIP. Her youngest child was born in 2001. See\n2\nEx. 4.\n3\nApplicant, who drank to excess on the weekends in college, also used cocaine\nduring her senior year on occasion (\u201cjust a night out type thing\u201d) (Ex. 4, Tr. 62). In June\n1989, she was awarded her bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering (Ex. 1).\nIn April 1992, Applicant and her now ex-spouse married, and they had a daughter in\n1995 (Exs. 1, 4).  By the mid to late 1990s, Applicant was drinking and gambling at a\n2\nlocal casino, which caused some problems in her marriage (Ex. 4). Following a driving\nunder the influence offense in September 1998, Applicant stopped going to the casino,\nand in 1999, she completed inpatient and intensive outpatient treatment for alcohol\nabuse. She also began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings on a weekly\nbasis, even though her spouse was not supportive of her AA involvement, and she\nstopped drinking alcohol (Exs. 3, 4). Applicant and her spouse later had a son in June\n2001 (Ex. 1).\nFollowing a car accident in March 2004 (Ex. A, Tr. 61), Applicant began to suffer\nchronic pain due to spinal stenosis and degenerative disk disease. Surgery was\ncontraindicated (\u201clast option\u201d) due to other medical issues. In September 2004, she\nstarted taking a prescribed narcotic (Vicodin) for post-procedure pain after steroid\ninjections for her lumbar discomfort (Ex. A, Tr. 26, 32). At the recommendation of an\northopedist, she received treatment from a chiropractor for ten weeks and then from a\nphysical therapist for another ten weeks, but these treatments failed to alleviate her pain\n(Tr. 32). Her Vicodin dose was increased over time as her pain became overwhelming\n(Tr. 30-31). As of mid-January 2005, she was taking 5 milligrams of Vicodin two to three\ntimes a day (Ex. A). She remained abstinent from alcohol, although in 2005, she\nstopped going to her weekly AA meeting because she felt guilty attending AA when she\nwas addicted to Vicodin (Exs. 2, 3, 4, Tr. 73). Additional steroid injections in the fall of\n2005 provided no significant lasting relief from her pain (Ex. A).\nApplicant used cocaine at a New Year\u2019s Eve party on December 31, 2005, or\nJanuary 1, 2006 (Tr. 63). Feeling stress because of her failing marriage and her medical\nproblems, and dependent on Vicodin, Applicant began to use cocaine in January 2006\nto reduce her  stress, relieve her pain, and because it was \u201cfun\u201d (Ex. 2, Tr. 64). She\nused the drug  while socializing with friends and also at home alone. She purchased\ncocaine about ten times from the same person, who worked at a local bar (Tr. 66-67).\nShe continued to snort the drug after two surgeries. Her first surgery, which was in\nMarch 2006, left her in worse pain and unable to work. Her dosage of Vicodin was\nincreased. In late May 2006, she had surgery for her herniated disks, which led to a\nreduction in her pain, and consequent decrease in her Vicodin dose (Exs. 2, 3, 4, A, Tr.\n26). In early July 2006, she returned to work for the defense contractor (Ex. A).\nApplicant continued to use and purchase cocaine, knowing that it was illegal. She gave\nno thought at the time to whether it was against her employer\u2019s drug policy and DoD\nsecurity guidelines (Tr. 68-69).\nAbout four hours after snorting cocaine in August 2006, Applicant took her\nchildren and one of their friends to the local mall where she lost her wallet containing\n\nCommunity service records indicate Applicant was required to complete 32 hours of community\n3\nservice by July 6, 2007. She completed her hours between July 13, 2007, and July 20, 2007. Despite her\nbelated compliance, the court dismissed the drug charge and the state dropped the felony risk of injury to a\nminor charge.\n4\ncocaine. Mall security acquired possession, and found three small packs of cocaine,\neach containing about a half gram of the drug. Local police were called, and Applicant\nwas arrested and charged with possession of cocaine and with felony risk of injury to a\nminor (Exs. 2, 3, 4, Tr. 79). At the referral of her attorney, Applicant was evaluated by a\nclinical psychologist in August 2006, who diagnosed her with major depressive disorder,\nrecurrent, moderate level, with opioid dependence, and with cocaine abuse (Ex. 4, Tr.\n80). Applicant attended weekly treatment sessions with the clinical psychologist starting\nAugust 25, 2006 (SOR 1.d), and she resumed weekly AA meetings. She was spending\nabout $150 per week on lottery tickets, but managed to avoid casino gambling, and she\nabstained from the use of cocaine. By the time she appeared in court in late September\n2006, she had weaned herself off her narcotic analgesic medication under a plan\ndevised with the consultation of the clinical psychologist and her physician (Exs. 3, 4, A,\nTr. 28). The court approved her application to enter a pretrial drug rehabilitation\nprogram, and continued her case until July 2007 pending her completion of 32 hours of\ncommunity service and the drug program (Exs. 2, 3, B).\nIn addition to her weekly AA meetings and sessions with the clinical psychologist,\non September 20, 2006, Applicant began attending a weekly relapse prevention group,\nand biweekly individual mental health and substance abuse counseling sessions with a\nlicensed alcohol and drug counselor (LADC) employed as a clinical supervisor at the\ncounseling center (SOR 1.e) (Exs. 4, 5, Tr. 28). A psychiatrist affiliated with the center\nstarted Applicant on a second medication for bipolar issues to supplement the\nantidepressant that she had been taking since 2001 (Exs. 4, 5).\nFollowing an incident of domestic violence against her in October 2006, Applicant\nand her spouse decided to divorce. With the social supports of AA and the relapse\nprevention group, and with her divorce progressing smoothly, Applicant was not\ngambling, or using any illegal drugs as of her last session of record with the clinical\npsychologist on November 6, 2006. The clinical psychologist assessed her prognosis as\nvery good to excellent (Ex. 4).\nDespite her ongoing individual counseling and group sessions at the counseling\ncenter (Ex. 1), and weekly AA attendance (Tr. 29), Applicant relapsed and used cocaine\nat a party on January 1, 2007 (Ex. 2, Tr. 70). A friend gave her the cocaine (Ex. 2). In\nFebruary 2007, Applicant completed the court-ordered 12-hour pretrial drug education\nclass at a local alcohol rehabilitation center (Exs. 3, B, Tr. 28-29). Yet, she used and\npurchased cocaine while at a bar with a friend on March 17, 2007 (Ex. 2, Tr. 71). In July\n2007, Applicant completed the community service hours required by the court, and the\ndrug charge was dismissed.  The felony risk of injury charge was nolle prossed (Ex. 3).\n3\nIn August 2007, Applicant\u2019s divorce was final (Ex. 1).\n\n5\nApplicant completed an e-QIP on November 20, 2007, for a periodic\nreinvestigation of her security clearance. She listed her past counseling with the clinical\npsychologist, and her ongoing counseling with the LADC and psychiatrist affiliated with\nthe substance abuse counseling center. In response to inquiry concerning her police\nrecord, she disclosed her August 2006 drug offense. Concerning illegal drug use in the\npast seven years, she indicated that she used cocaine five times from April 2006 to\nAugust 2006, which led to her arrest in August 2006 (Ex. 1). She did not disclose the full\nextent of her cocaine abuse, including her relapses in 2007. Applicant\u2019s explanation is\nthat she guessed about the extent of her cocaine use, \u201cbased on [her] best recollection\nof what [she] could remember\u201d (Tr. 81).\nOn February 6, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout her cocaine use. She indicated that she snorted cocaine every other weekend\nfrom January 2006 until her arrest in August 2006, and she disclosed her relapses in\nJanuary 2007 and March 2007. Applicant denied any use of cocaine after March 17,\n2007, and any intent to use cocaine in the future (Ex. 2).\nOn March 4, 2008, Applicant was discharged from her counseling with the LADC.\nApplicant was considered stable in her recovery from \u201cco-occurring Bipolar disorder and\nCocaine and Alcohol Abuse diagnosis.\u201d She had been compliant with treatment,\nincluding taking her antidepressant and bipolar medications and maintaining sobriety as\nevidenced by drug screens. The LADC recommended that Applicant continue her\nmedication regimen and AA/NA for support with her recovery. In an undated letter, the\ncounselor recommended to DOHA that Applicant maintain her security clearance based\non her observations that Applicant had maintained sobriety and remained stable in her\nrecovery program (Ex. 5).\nApplicant continued to attend AA on most Sundays through late August 2009.\nShe had not attended an AA meeting in the two weeks preceding her September 16,\n2009, hearing, and gave no reason for her failure to attend (\u201cDon\u2019t particularly know.\u201d)\n(Tr. 73-74). She intends to continue her current level of commitment to AA (Tr. 44).\nApplicant has had two sponsors in AA. She obtained a sponsor when she first went to\nAA for help in maintaining sobriety from alcohol. When she returned to AA after her\narrest in 2006, she acquired a new sponsor. Applicant did not call her sponsor as often\nas she should have, and she terminated the sponsorship after only six weeks (Tr. 90).\nOn her discharge from her counseling in March 2008, Applicant began a\ntherapeutic relationship with a new psychiatrist, primarily for monitoring of her\nmedications, although also for help controlling urges, including to gamble and to use\nalcohol and cocaine (Tr. 56-57, 84). While she had not gambled at an establishment in\nthe last five years, she had a problem in the past with overspending on the lottery\n(scratch tickets) (Tr. 56-57). Applicant met with the psychiatrist once a month until July\n2009,  when he reduced the frequency of their sessions to once every three months (Tr.\n44-45, 48-49). At the recommendation of the psychiatrist, Applicant began counseling\nwith someone in his practice in the spring of 2008. Applicant did not feel comfortable\nand only went to two sessions with the counselor (Tr. 86-87). After she expressed\nconcerns about an increase in stress and pressure at work, the psychiatrist suggested\n\n6\nthat she might want to seek counseling with someone else, but she chose not to (Tr.\n87).\nApplicant has been abstinent from illegal drugs since her last use on March 17,\n2007 (Tr. 71). At times, including as recently as September 2009, she has had thoughts\nof using cocaine to cope with stress from her children and work (Tr. 84-86). She has no\nplans to use cocaine (Tr. 85). She has not consumed any alcohol since February 1999\n(Tr. 30, 76). Her intent is to maintain a lifestyle free of illegal drugs and alcohol (Tr. 43).\nApplicant is still friendly with someone with whom she used cocaine in the past. They\nget together about once a month. Applicant testified that this friend no longer uses\ncocaine, although she was unable to testify as to when her friend last used cocaine.\nApplicant has not been in the presence of someone using cocaine since March 2007\n(Tr. 77). She no longer goes to the bar where she bought cocaine in the past (Tr. 78).\nApplicant\u2019s cocaine abuse did not impair her work performance with the defense\ncontractor. She exceeded job requirements for the appraisal periods March 2007 to\nMarch 2008 (Exs. 3, D), and March 2008 to March 2009 (Ex. D). The manager of\nengineering for her department, her second level supervisor, has had a professional\nassociation with her since 1994. He attests to Applicant having responsibility for\ntechnical and task management of diverse development and testing projects. She\ndemonstrated a commitment to completing requirements and a record of appropriate\nattentiveness and accountability in handling classified assignments over the years. The\nengineer who directly supervised Applicant in the first phase of her career, and then\nfrom about 2005 through at least March 2009,  considers her to be \u201ca long-time and\nvalues [sic] asset\u201d to the engineering department, and he recommends that her\nclearance be continued (Ex. C). Applicant informed both supervisors of her arrest for\npossession of narcotics. She did not tell them that the drug involved was cocaine or that\nshe had ever used cocaine (Tr. 70).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n7\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\n\nThis clinical psychologist also diagnosed Applicant with opioid dependence, presumably because\n4\nof her addiction to the narcotic analgesic Vicodin. Yet, absent evidence that Applicant abused her prescription\nby using the drug in a manner that deviated from approved medical direction, her use of Vicodin is not drug\nabuse within AG \u00b6 24.\nIn ISCR Case No. 07-00558, decided on April 7, 2008, the DOHA Appeal Board cautioned against\n5\nan overly strict definition of the terms medical professional and licensed clinical social worker. Although that\ncase involved the alcohol consumption guidelines AG \u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d\nand AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who\nis a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d  the issue is whether the person is qualified to\ndiagnose substance abuse problems, alcohol or illegal drugs or both. The clinician in question here is a LADC\nwho serves as a clinical supervisor at a state human service and community development agency. \nDOHA alleged Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine while she held a security clearance under Guideline E.\n6\nDepartment Counsel conceded in her closing argument that the use of drugs after being granted a security\nclearance more appropriately raises Guideline H concerns, but she did not move to amend the SOR.\nNonetheless, the circumstances under which Applicant used the illegal drugs covered under SOR 1.a must\nbe considered in determining the applicability of Guideline H\u2019s disqualifying and mitigating conditions.\n8\nApplicant used cocaine approximately every other weekend from January 2006\nuntil August 12, 2006, when she was arrested for possession of cocaine. She relapsed\ntwice while in counseling with a LADC and attending weekly AA and substance abuse\nrelapse prevention meetings. She snorted cocaine at a party on January 1, 2007, and at\na bar on March 17, 2007. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d applies. Applicant purchased\ncocaine at least ten times in 2006 and again on March 17, 2007, and had possession of\nthe drug when she used it and when she was arrested on August 12, 2006, so AG \u00b6\n25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d is implicated. Furthermore,\nAG \u00b6 25(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(e),\n\u201cevaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who\nis a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program,\u201d are also pertinent. The\nclinical psychologist who treated Applicant in 2006 diagnosed her with cocaine abuse\nand opioid dependence.  The LADC, who counseled Applicant from September 2006\n4\nuntil March 2008, indicated on Applicant\u2019s discharge that Applicant had \u201cexhibited\nimproved social functioning with management of co-occurring Bipolar disorder and\nCocaine and Alcohol abuse diagnosis.\u201d  AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being\n5\ngranted a security clearance,\u201d also applies in light of the fact that all of Applicant\u2019s\ncocaine use occurred while she held a secret security clearance.6\nApplicant has not used any cocaine since March 17, 2007. However, her abuse\nof cocaine was not limited to the five times she reported on her e-QIP. She told a\ngovernment investigator in February 2008 that she used it every other weekend from\nJanuary 2006 until her arrest on August 12, 2006, and she relapsed twice in 2007.\nApplicant did not detail the frequency of her involvement when she was questioned at\nher September 2009 hearing. But she admitted she had purchased cocaine about ten\ntimes, and she used the drug when home alone as well as with friends. AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\n\n9\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably be applied.\nConcerning whether Applicant has demonstrated an intent to forego future drug\nabuse sufficient to satisfy AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in\nthe future,\u201d Applicant maintains an active friendship with one of the women with whom\nshe used cocaine in the past, but this friend has not used cocaine in her presence in the\npast few years and Applicant believes her friend is no longer using illegal drugs. Since\nApplicant is no longer associating with persons whom she believes use drugs at\npresent, AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d is a\nfactor that must be considered in her favor in assessing whether she has made the\nnecessary changes to maintain a lifestyle free of substance abuse. AG \u00b6 26(b)(2),\n\u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used,\u201d applies in that she no\nlonger frequents the bar at which she purchased cocaine. I cannot apply AG \u00b6 26(b)(3),\n\u201can appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d because of her relapses in 2007 while she was in\ncounseling, and her ongoing urges, albeit not acted on, to use cocaine to cope with\nstress as recently as September 2009. Applicant has repeatedly expressed her intent to\nabstain from illegal drugs, orally to a government investigator in February 2008 (Ex. 2)\nand at her hearing (Tr. 43), and in writing when she answered the SOR. AG \u00b6 26(b)(4)\nrequires a written commitment to abstain under the penalty of automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. Applicant\u2019s notarized statement of intent to maintain a drug-\nfree lifestyle is not sufficient to apply AG \u00b6 26(b)(4).\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to deal with her cocaine abuse problem are consistent with a\ncredible intent to abstain. Her initial counseling with the clinical psychologist cannot be\nconsidered completely voluntary because she was facing serious criminal charges for\ncocaine possession and felony risk of injury to a minor. However, Applicant participated\nin treatment well beyond the pretrial drug education program required by the court. She\ncompleted 18 months of counseling with the LADC, who presumably had a favorable\nassessment of Applicant\u2019s prognosis since she recommended to DOHA that Applicant\nretain her security clearance because of her sobriety and stability in her recovery\nprogram. Applicant followed up with recommended medication management with a new\npsychiatrist, and she attended AA on most Sundays. There is no evidence of recurrence\nof drug abuse since March 17, 2007, when Applicant abused cocaine while in treatment.\nBut I cannot apply AG \u00b6 26(d), \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug\ntreatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional.\u201d Family and work-related stress have led Applicant to think about using\ncocaine and alcohol as recently as the week before her hearing in September 2009. Her\ntreating psychiatrist in summer 2009 reduced the frequency of their sessions from once\na month to once every three months. While it would indicate a stability in her\nmedications, Applicant is without any professional counseling for significant periods.\nThe psychiatrist had recommended in 2008 that she obtain counseling, but she went to\nonly two sessions because she did not feel comfortable with the clinician. AA could\nprovide Applicant with the necessary support to maintain her sobriety. Yet, despite\nbeing a frequent attendee at AA meetings over the past three years,  Applicant has not\n\n10\nhad a sponsor in AA since late fall 2006. As of her hearing in September 2009,\nApplicant had not attended AA in two weeks despite recent stress, and she offered no\nexplanation for her absence from AA. Based on the record evidence before me, I cannot\nsafely conclude that her drug abuse is safely in the past.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant exercised poor judgment within the context of AG \u00b6 15. She used and\npurchased cocaine while she held an active security clearance. She may not have been\nthinking about her clearance obligations, or that cocaine use was against DoD policy\nwhen she used the drug, but she knew she was violating the law by doing so. Applicant\nrisked the health and safety of her children and one of their friends by using cocaine\nbefore taking them to a local mall in August 2006. Furthermore, AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing,\u201d is\npertinent. Cocaine abuse is conduct which, if known, could affect her reputation at work.\nThe two supervisors, who attested favorably to her character and work performance\n(Ex. C), are not aware that she used cocaine or that her arrest involved cocaine.\nApplicant was also not completely forthright about the extent of her cocaine\nabuse when she completed her e-QIP. She reported that she used cocaine only five\ntimes between April 2006 and August 2006. During her subject interview, she indicated\nthat she used the drug every other weekend from January 2006 until her arrest in\nAugust 2006, and she relapsed twice in 2007. At her September 2009 hearing, she\nadmitted she purchased cocaine on about ten occasions, and there is no evidence that\nshe bought the drug for someone else\u2019s consumption. It is simply not credible that\nApplicant would fail to recall in November 2007 that she had used cocaine in January\n2007 and again in March 2007. Deliberate omission of such recent drug involvement\nwould implicate AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d but the government did not cite falsification of her e-QIP as a\nbasis to revoke her security clearance. Applicant\u2019s minimization of her illegal drug\ninvolvement is nonetheless relevant in assessing her security worthiness under the\nwhole-person concept, infra.\n\n11\nApplicant\u2019s cocaine abuse, especially while she held a security clearance, is too\nrecent and serious to satisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or\nso much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d By the summer of 2006,\nApplicant was using cocaine primarily for fun and to cope with emotional stress rather\nthan to alleviate debilitating pain.\nAG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe person has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d applies in part. Since her arrest for\npossession of cocaine, Applicant has been in treatment for her admitted cocaine abuse\nproblem, and for mental health issues. But as discussed under Guideline H, supra, she\nhas not strengthened her commitment to AA or followed through with the counseling\nrecommended by her psychiatrist despite ongoing stressors. Her lack of candor about\nher cocaine abuse on her e-QIP raises doubts about the extent to which she is willing to\nacknowledge her behavior.\nFurthermore, while Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to inform all of her\ncoworkers about her cocaine abuse, she continues to conceal her cocaine abuse from\nthose supervisors who authored character reference letters on her behalf. Issues of\nvulnerability to pressure or exploitation have not been adequately mitigated. AG \u00b6 17(e),\n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d does not apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n\nTreatment itself is viewed favorably. Her cocaine abuse problem, which necessitated the treatment,\n7\nis covered under SOR 1.a-1.b.\n12\nApplicant showed extremely poor judgment in using and purchasing cocaine in\nknowing disregard of its illegality. She used the drug for fun while she held a security\nclearance, after a court had accepted her application for a drug rehabilitation program,\nand the state had agreed not to prosecute her for the felony risk of injury charge if she\ncompleted the program. Her extended counseling with the LADC was voluntary and\nreflects favorably on her, as does her good work record for the defense contractor. But\nconcerns persist about whether she has the level of support necessary for her to\nmaintain her sobriety. She receives no professional counseling at present other than\nwhat the psychiatrist provides once every three months. Her commitment to AA at this\npoint is questionable, given her lack of any effort to obtain a sponsor since 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s minimization of her cocaine abuse on her e-QIP, and her failure to provide a\ncredible explanation for the inaccurate disclosure, also cast doubt about whether she\ncan be counted on to put her obligation of candor before her self-interest. Based on the\nrecord before me for review, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant  \n7\n   \nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 10, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 13, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nThe Judge found that at least some of the photos and written material on one of the wife\u2019s pornographic sites\n1\nwere produced during the wife\u2019s prior relationship with a man other than Applicant.  This relationship was part of a series\nof events that achieved a degree of notoriety.  Although not separately alleged, these findings and the evidence upon\nwhich they are based are relevant to the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis.  See Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(a).\nIn her findings, the Judge stated that Applicant denied that his wife solicits clients or advertises that she\n2\nprovides adult entertainment.  However, Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the SOR.  Additionally,\nthe record contains evidence which supports Applicant\u2019s admissions.  Government Exhibit (GE) 5 at 10-11; GE 8 at 2.\n \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact, which include Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions contained in his response to the SOR: Applicant is a network architect for a Federal\ncontractor.  Applicant is married and has a child.\nApplicant met his wife in the early 2000s, and they began dating in 2004, marrying two years\nlater.  Applicant\u2019s wife maintains two web sites which specialize in hardcore pornographic content,\nsome of which includes photographs of her, as well as written commentary about events in her life.1\nShe does not identify herself explicitly in these web sites, relying on a pseudonym.  However, she\nalso operates a third web site under her own name, which contains references to Applicant.  It would\nbe possible for a person with the requisite computer skill to connect Applicant\u2019s wife with the two\npornographic sites.  She solicits clients on one or more of her web sites, and she maintains an\n\u201cescort\u201d posting advertising her own availability for \u201cadult entertainment.\u201d   \n2\nApplicant\u2019s family is not aware of these web sites.  Moreover, Applicant\u2019s employer is not\naware of them either.  The Judge stated that Applicant had not demonstrated any steps he had taken\nto reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to exploitation or coercion.  \nApplicant contends on appeal that he has not advised his employer or his family members\nof his wife\u2019s web sites because the content is not something he would normally discuss with them.\nHe states that the web sites are accessible to the public and, therefore, are not by nature the sort of\nprivate matters that could lead to blackmail.  However, under the facts of this case, the Judge\u2019s\nfindings and the record evidence establish a reason to believe that the web sites, if they became\nidentified with Applicant through his wife, could affect his professional or community standing.\nAccordingly, they are a means through which Applicant could foreseeably be subjected to coercion\nor duress.  See Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 16(e).  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s presentation\nfailed to mitigate this concern is sustainable.\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He also prepared and signed an Electronic\n1\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on May 31, 2005.  The Defense\n2\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline E on October 10, 2008. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\nApril 13, 2010\n\nDepartment Counsel identified AE D as Applicant\u2019s Post Hearing Exhibit 1 in its response to Applicant\u2019s\n3\nsubmission.\n2\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR and submitted an answer in writing on November 6,\n2008. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On June 19, 2009,\nDepartment Counsel submitted an Amended Statement of Reasons, which Applicant\nanswered on July 23, 2009. DOHA received his answer on July 24, 2009. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on August 31, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on October 23, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 28,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 17, 2009. The\nGovernment offered twelve exhibits (GE) 1 through 12, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He\nsubmitted three exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received and admitted into\nevidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nNovember 25, 2009. I held the record open until December 2, 2009, for Applicant and\nDepartment Counsel to submit additional matters.  On December 1, 2009, Applicant\nsubmitted seven exhibits, AE D through AE J. Department Counsel submitted a written\nresponse to Applicant\u2019s new evidence and one additional exhibit, GE 13, on December\n8, 2009. Department Counsel objected to AE D as irrelevant. Department Counsel did\nnot object to Applicant\u2019s remaining submissions. The record closed on December 8,\n2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on November 9, 2009. (Tr. 10.) At the\nhearing, I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice\nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Id.) \nEvidence\nApplicant submitted a copy of the Supreme Court docket sheet (AE D ) on a case\n3\nsubmitted into evidence at the hearing by the Government (GE 9 - GE 11). The\nGovernment objected to the admission of AE D, arguing that this evidence is not\nrelevant to the decision in this case. Because the Government submitted the initial trial\ncourt decision and partial transcript, I will admit AE D and assign it what weight, if any,\nis appropriate.\n\nW hen SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence\n4\nsufficient to prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First,\nthe government must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR\nindeed took place. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the\nestablished facts and events and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App.\nBd.

His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. He denied the factual allegation in \u00b6 1.c. \nThe Government revised the SOR with new allegations 1.a through 1.f. The new\nallegations 1.e and 1.f are the same as allegations 1.b and 1.c in the original SOR. In\nhis response to the Amended SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b and 1.e. He denied the remaining Amended SOR allegations.  He also provided\n4\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant, who is 34 years old, works as a network architect for a Department of\nJustice contractor. He began his employment in September 2007, after being recruited\nby his employer. Applicant has a high school diploma and many certificates for\ncomputer networking skills, including network technology and information security. He\noperated his own consulting business before accepting his current position. Besides his\njob, he continues to be active in \u201cthe open source, an[d] information security\ncommunities\u201d and operates a free open source security project that is used around the\nworld.  \n5\nIn April 2002, Applicant purchased a residence for his parents and himself. In\nthat same year, Applicant met his future wife through an on-line chat room. They began\ndating and became engaged in 2004. After becoming engaged, he did not move into her\nhouse and she did not move into his house. They, however, spent significant time with\neach other at each other\u2019s homes. They married in January 2006, now reside together\nin a house in another location, and have a daughter, born in December 2006.

She received $323\nfrom her web designer business in 2006. Tax returns for the years 2007 and 2008\nreflected that she has not received income from her web design business or any other\nbusiness.

Applicant does not have\nfinancial issues.7\nIn the middle 1990's, Applicant\u2019s wife became involved in alternative sexual\nlifestyles. In 1997, she began a voluntary bondage, discipline or dominant submissive,\nsado masochistic (BDSM) relationship with a vile and brutally dominant man. In 1998, a\nsecond woman moved in with her at the request of this man and was involved in a\nsimilar relationship with the man. During this relationship and at the direction of her\ndominant man, Applicant\u2019s wife developed a pornography website. She and her\nroommate regularly placed pictures and written descriptions of their sexual relationship\nwith this man on this website. Applicant\u2019s wife terminated this relationship in 1999, but\nthe other woman continued the relationship until 2003 at another location. Applicant\ndenies the dominant man threatened his wife; but, according to the other woman in a\nlater court proceeding, the man threatened harm to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s godson and to\nexpose his wife\u2019s activities to her elderly father, when his wife was terminating the\nrelationship.8\nWhen she ended her relationship with her dominant man, Applicant\u2019s wife\nshutdown the pornography website. Within two years, she opened a new adult website\n(website 1), using materials from this relationship, including pictures, videos, diaries,\nand written commentary. Applicant\u2019s wife described her website as a chronicle of her\njourney into BDSM, without mentioning her own name. Website 1 contained a link to her\nhardcore pornography website, which she created using a pseudonym. She opened\nanother pornography website (website 2), which is not specifically identified as a\nchronicle of her journey into BDSM, but contained information of a similar vein. Again,\nher actual identify is not mentioned. Websites 1 and 2 continue to exist on a web server\nand can be accessed by those who seek it. She registered the domain name for these\nwebsites and continued to hold the domain name and registration.9\nApplicant\u2019s wife told him about her BDSM relationships and her website shortly\nafter they began dating in 2002. He knows about her websites, which he described as\nher stories about alternative sexual lifestyles. He supports her right to continue these\nwebsites, arguing that the websites are protected free speech under the First\nAmendment because the websites are her stories, which have literary value.10\nApplicant\u2019s wife also developed a personal, social website (website 3) under her\nown name. Through this website, she discussed her personal life, marriage, and birth of\nher daughter. She posted pictures of her wedding, which show Applicant. A computer\nsearch under his wife\u2019s maiden name revealed many references to her with some using\n\nGE 5; GE 7; Tr. 77-80.\n11\nTr. 52-53.\n12\nGE 5.\n13\n5\nher married name. Applicant acknowledged that anyone with competent computer skills\ncould follow her website 3 to website 1 and website 2, making the connection between\nhis wife\u2019s name and her pseudonym. His wife developed another website (website 4),\nwhich offers web design for small businesses. The domain registration for website 4\nreferenced a technical contact, which shows a possible connection to the pornography\nwebsites 1 and 2.  \n11\nWebsites 1 and 2\nApplicant\u2019s wife developed website 1 in 2001. The website had copyright\nprotection in the same year. Applicant described this website as his wife\u2019s fictionalized\nstories based on her own experiences and second-hand information obtained from\nothers. After meeting people at a benefit for sex workers (date is unknown), his wife\ndecided to write about alternative sexual lifestyles through her website. She is currently\nwriting a novel on this subject12\nWebsite 1 provides access from page one to additional written information and\nsome pictures about its contents by a \u201cclick here\u201d direction. Website 1 includes a\n\u201cMembers, Please Click Here to Enter\u201d point of access to specific details of her\nalternative sexual lifestyle, which, by her description, involves hardcore pornography.\nThe contents of the hardcore pornography site are not of record. Page 1 of website 1\nincludes advertisements for access to other BDSM pornography sites, including\nhardcore pornography.13\nApplicant\u2019s wife is not actively working website 1 and has not done so for three\nyears. However, individuals can access this website by searching the web. When an\nindividual accesses the website, written material which is a lengthy discussion prepared\nand published by Applicant\u2019s wife on her personal views on BDSM and nude pictures\nwith some bondage pictures of Applicant\u2019s wife can be viewed simply by clicking on the\n\u201cclick here\u201d point. To view her hardcore pornography materials, membership is required.\nHow an individual obtains the necessary membership is not explained. Likewise,\nmembership costs, income earned from these memberships, and costs for the website\noperations are not explained or shown, nor does the record contain evidence showing\nthat Applicant\u2019s wife has sent her pornography materials to a member of the public. If\nsomeone clicks on one of the ads for other BDSM pornography sites, the link transfers\nthe individual to that pornography website. While she provides access, his wife has no\ncontrol over the content of these websites, does not actually provide the pornography\nmaterials requested, and has not provided information, including her website materials,\nfor these websites.

The record lacks any\nevidence that Applicant\u2019s wife is distributing materials from these websites.14\nThe website 2 access page shows two suggestive pictures of Applicant\u2019s wife\nand two pages of written materials. If someone is interested in more information or\nmaterials, website 2 provides a link to website 1. One page of this website contains\nadvertisements providing linkage to other BDSM pornography sites.  \n15\nIn SOR \u00b6 1.b, the government alleges that Applicant\u2019s wife solicits clients and\nmaintains an escort posting that advertises her availability for adult entertainment.\nApplicant strongly denied that his wife is or was available for adult entertainment. GE 5\ncontains a page which lists sources for escorts for adult entertainment in cities all over\nthe United States and several cities in Canada and one European city. This particular\ndocument lacks any specific reference to Applicant\u2019s wife. No other information in the\nrecord specifically identifies his wife as being available as an escort for adult\nentertainment. However, a summary of a federal investigation, see infra, indicates that\nas of May 2007, if one enters the escort website, one can find a profile for his wife under\nher pseudonym, indicating her availability for \u201cin Call - - Out Call\u201d \u201cEscort\u201d services.     \n16\nCourt case\nApplicant\u2019s wife terminated the BDSM relationship with her dominant man in\n1999. She also ceased contacts with the other woman living with her and involved in a\nBDSM relationship with the same dominant man. In November 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife\nfiled a complaint in a state court requesting a peace order, which is a civil order, against\nthe other woman.  The State court issued a temporary peace order the same day. The\n17\nrecord contains no other evidence that Applicant\u2019s wife maintained any further contact\nwith the other woman after the fall of 1999.  \n18\nThe other woman continued her BDSM relationship with the dominant man in\nanother location several hundred miles from where Applicant\u2019s wife lived. This woman\nsevered her BDSM relationship with the dominant man in 2003. At some point, the other\nwoman\u2019s BDSM relationship changed from a voluntary relationship to an involuntary\nrelationship because of the threats of harm made if she did not stay with him. She filed\na criminal complaint in another state against the dominant man. The federal grand jury\n\nGE 9; GE 10; GE 13; AE D.

Federal authorities arrested him on May 12, 2005 on this indictment.\nThe jury in his trial found him guilty of sex trafficking and forced labor under 18  U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1589 and 1591 (Trafficking Victims Protection Act), and not guilty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1462(a) of dissemination through an interactive computer device of obscene materials,\nwhich included images of bound and tortured women engaged in sexually explicit\nconduct. The dominant man appealed his case to the federal appellate court, which\noverturned the conviction on Ex Post Facto constitutional grounds. The Government\nappealed the reversal to the United States Supreme Court, which granted the\nGovernment\u2019s Petition for Certiorari on October 13, 2009. The case is currently pending\nbefore the United States Supreme Court.    \n19\nFederal law enforcement authorities interviewed Applicant\u2019s wife in May 2004\nand conducted a brief telephone interview in May 2005 as part of their investigation into\nthe criminal conduct of the dominant man. They conducted a personal interview in\nJanuary 2007 in preparation for her possibly testifying at trial. The federal investigators\nindicated that they had knowledge of the BDSM relationship between Applicant\u2019s wife\nand the dominant man, of website 1, and of website 2. Their report indicated that\nwebsites 1 and 2 were active as of the May 11, 2007, as well as the profile on the escort\nwebsite. Finally, the report noted that Applicant\u2019s wife was not charged in the dominant\nman matter and did not testify. It also indicated that Applicant\u2019s wife was not charged\nwith a crime related to her images on her website.20\nSecurity Clearance Applications\nApplicant completed his first SF-86 on June 10, 2004. He listed his personal\nresidence as the property purchased on April 2002. In response to Question 7, he listed\nhis wife as a person who knew him well and two other individuals. He completed an e-\nQIP on May 31, 2005 and again listed as his personal residence the property he\npurchased in April 2002. He did not list his wife as a person who knew him well under\nSection 12 or her home address as his. He listed the same two individuals listed in 2004\nplus one other. He also did not list his wife as an adult currently living with him under\nSection 14/15. Applicant submitted his second SF-86 on August 10, 2007, where he\nindicated that he had married. He identified his wife and listed her address as his\nresidence from January 2006. In 2005, under Section 12, he named two of the\nindividuals previously named as knowing him, one of whom he also named in 2004, and\na third person. His listed his personal property as his address from April 2002 until\nJanuary 2006. He explained that he did not list his wife\u2019s address as his prior to their\nmarriage because his legal address and where he received his mail was the property he\n\nResponse to SOR; GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; AE E; Tr. 66-67.\n21\nAE J; Tr. 89.\n22\nGE 3; Tr. 119.\n23\nGE 11; Tr. 86-90.\n24\n8\nowned and because he lived at both his house and hers. He did not provide an\nexplanation for the omission of his wife\u2019s name in 2005.21\nApplicant\u2019s project manager describes Applicant as a very experienced network\nand security engineer who holds difficult-to-obtain certifications related to the work done\nin their office. He works with Applicant on a daily basis and has spent time with\nApplicant in social settings. Applicant behaves in a totally professional and trustworthy\nmanner at all times. Applicant complies with all security processes and procedures, and\ndoes not take shortcuts. Applicant is highly regarded by his co-workers and\nmanagement for his skills and work ethic. The principal systems engineer holds a\nsimilar opinion of Applicant. Applicant acknowledged that he does not discuss sexual\nlifestyle issues or his wife\u2019s websites at work. He believes such discussions are\ninappropriate in the workplace. His employer is not aware of his wife\u2019s websites.22\nApplicant does not discuss his sex life with his parents nor has he discussed his\nwife\u2019s website with them as conversations about his personal sex life are not\nconversations he has with his parents. If necessary, he would tell his parents about the\nwebsite. He indicated his brother knows about her website. Her parents are deceased.23\nApplicant denied that his wife\u2019s past relationship with the dominant man poses a\ncurrent threat to him or his family although the dominant man threatened to send\npictures to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s father or harm her godson in 1999. Applicant strongly\ndisagreed with Department Counsel\u2019s position that the BDSM community is more\ndangerous than the general population or community-at-large. The Government\nprovided no evidence to support this view and Applicant provided no evidence to\ncontradict the Government\u2019s argument. Applicant strongly denied that his wife\u2019s past\nrelationship with the dominant man, her pornography websites, and contacts with the\nBDSM community create a security risk for him.24\nAt the hearing, Applicant strongly supported his wife\u2019s right to publish \u201cher\nstories\u201d about her BDSM lifestyle. He does not believe her work meets the legal test for\nobscenity and he does not believe her websites violate the law. There is no evidence\nthat Applicant and his wife are embarrassed or ashamed of her website or her past\nlifestyle. Applicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing did not reflect any sense of\nembarrassment or humiliation about his wife\u2019s website or past lifestyle. \n\nIn its pre-hearing brief, the Government cites to United States v. Ragsdale, 426 F.3d 765 (5  Cir. 2005)\n25\nth\nand United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701 (6  Cir. 1996) to show that individuals distributing sexually\nth\nexplicit materials can be prosecuted in any jurisdiction. In both cases, the defendants placed sexually\nexplicit materials on personal computers. The defendants then solicited sales, transferred the sexually\nexplicit materials to tapes, and distributed the tapes through the mail or common carrier. W hile the\nGovernment is correct that Applicant\u2019s wife could be prosecuted for selling her sexually explicit materials\nin a jurisdiction where the materials are delivered, there is no evidence in the record that materials from\nher websites have been sold and then delivered through the mails or by common carrier to the\npurchasers, nor does the record contain evidence of any distribution of her materials in any manner.\n9\nLegal issues\nApplicant argues that his wife\u2019s work is protected by the first amendment\nbecause it does not meet the obscenity test articulated by the Supreme Court in Miller v\nCalifornia, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). He contends that it is inappropriate to bypass the\ncriminal justice system and find his wife guilty of criminal conduct without being charged\nwith a crime and having a trial.\nDepartment Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s wife is engaged in criminal activity\nbecause her internet websites meet the obscenity definition and thus, violate federal\nand state law because she is distributing hardcore pornography.  Department Counsel\n25\ncontends that Applicant\u2019s long-standing relationship with his wife, who is engaged in an\nactivity which is criminal in nature, raises questions about his judgment. Finally,\nDepartment Counsel  argues that Applicant didn\u2019t list his wife on his 2005 e-QIP in order\nto hide her activities. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n10\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nUnder AG \u00b6 16, the following conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay disqualify Applicant for a security clearance:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-\n26\n23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n11\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer must be deliberate. The government established that Applicant omitted a\nmaterial fact from his 2005 e-QIP when he failed to list his wife as a person who knew\nhim well. This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to\nhold a security clearance and to his honesty. In his response, he denies, however, that\nhe had an intent to hide this information from the government. When a falsification\nallegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an\nomission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record\nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence\nconcerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.26\nApplicant made the Government aware of a close personal friend on his SF-86 in\n2004. After he married this friend in 2006, he listed her in his 2007 SF-86. On his first\ntwo security clearance applications, he listed, as his residence, the property he\npurchased in 2002, and on his 2007 SF-86, as his residence from April 2002 until\nJanuary 2006. He used this address for receipt of all personal matters, such as voting\nregistration, car registration, bills, and other relevant materials because he did live at\nthis address, but not all of the time. He considered this address as his home and legal\naddress, although he spent significant time at his wife\u2019s home when they were dating.\nShe also spent time at his home. His list of individuals who knew him well changed with\neach application. Because the Government knew about his wife in 2004, his failure to\nlist her in 2005 cannot be viewed as intent to hide information about her pornography\nwebsites. The Government has not established a security concern. Allegation 1.f of the\namended SOR is found in favor of Applicant.\nThe Government argues that Applicant \u2018s wife is engaged in criminal conduct\nbecause through websites 1 and 2, she distributes obscene material in violation of\nfederal laws, specifically 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1462, 1465 and 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231. 47 U.S.C \u00a7\n\nThe United States Supreme Court held its predecessor law, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 223(a)(1) and 223(d),\n27\nunconstitutional in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, et al, 521 U.S. 844 (1997).\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Kilbride, 584 F.3d 1240 (9\n28\nth\nCir. 2009), discussed the Supreme Court\u2018s decision at length, then held that a national contemporary\ncommunity standard applied in cases involving transmission of obscene images over the internet.  The\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia disagreed with the holding in Kilbride. See United\nStates v. Stagliano,     F.Supp.2d    , 2010 W L 617364 (D.D.C.  Feb. 19, 2010). Stagliano involves a\nconstitutional challenge to the statues at issue in this case. The decision of the trial court provides a\ndiscussion on the issues now being presented to the federal courts concerning internet distribution of\npornography. Likewise, in United States v. Little, 2010 W L 357933 (11  Cir. 2010)(unpublished), the\nth\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit declined to apply the national standard articulated in\nKilbride.\n12\n231, the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), has been the subject of litigation in the\nfederal courts since its effective date in October 1998.  \n27\nIn an early challenge to the constitutionality of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction in\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 31 F.2d 473 (E.D. Pa. 1999), on the grounds\nthe ACLU would likely prevail on its First Amendment constitutional challenge that there\nwere less restrictive alternatives to COPA for controlling a website dissemination of\nmaterial \u201charmful to minors.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\naffirmed this finding on the contemporary community standards provision in the statute,\nreasoning that was not the basis for the issuance of a preliminary injunction. See\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 217 F.3d 162 (3d Cir. 2000). The United States\nSupreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals finding, holding that COPA\u2019s reliance on\ncommunity standards did not by itself render the statute substantially overbroad for First\nAmendment purposes, but declined to express a view as to whether COPA suffered\nfrom substantial overbreadth for reasons other than community standards. See Ashcroft\nv. American Civil liberties Union, 535 U.S. 564 (2002).  The Supreme Court ruled on\n28\none constitutional issue only and made it clear that its decision was a narrow one. \nThe United States Supreme Court remanded the case to the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit to reconsider the reasons given by the District Court for\ngranting the preliminary injunction. Id. On remand, the appellate court affirmed the\ndecision of the District Court, concluding that COPA was not the least restrictive means\navailable for the Government to serve the interest of preventing minors from gaining\naccess to harmful materials on the Internet and that the ACLU would most likely\nsucceed on its constitutional challenge. See American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft,\n322 F.3d 240 (3d Cir. 2003). Not only did the United States Supreme Court affirm the\ndecision of the United States Court of Appeals in Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties\nUnion, 542 U.S. 656 (2004) on this narrow issue, Justice Stevens, in his concurring\nopinion, also raised concerns about several other constitutional defects in COPA,\nconcerns expressed by other justices. Following remand from the United States\nSupreme Court, the District Court granted a permanent injunction, holding that the\nstatute was not narrowly tailored to Congress\u2019s compelling interest of protecting minors,\nthat the statute was unconstitutionally vague, and that the statute was unconstitutionally\n\nUnited States of America v. Reilly, 2003 W L 1878308 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)(unreported) involves a\n29\nconstitutional challenge under the First Amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462 by a federal employee who\ndownloaded pornography onto his office computer. The court disagreed with the employee\u2019s contention\nthat he had a constitutional right to receive pornography under the First Amendment. W hile this case does\nnot involve distribution of pornography to members of the public, it provides guidance into how the courts\nare viewing the use of interactive devices.\n13\noverbroad. See American Civil Liberities Union v. Gonzales, 478 F. Supp.2d 775 (E.D.\nPa. 2007). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the decision\nof the District Court that this statute was unconstitutional in American Civil Liberties\nUnion v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 181 (3d Cir. 2008), aff\u2019d sub nom. Mukasey v. American\nCivil Liberties Union, 129 S. Ct. 1032 (2009). Given the decision of the United States\nSupreme Court, the allegations of criminal activity by Applicant\u2019s wife under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\n231 cannot be substantiated.\nThe Government argues that pornography websites 1 and 2 of Applicant\u2019s wife\nare obscene, and that through her website, she is distributing obscene materials in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1462 and 1465 and the laws of one state. Applicant argues\nthat her websites do not meet the obscenity test articulated in Miller, 413 U.S. at 24-25.\nThe Government has not raised a security concern for Applicant under Adjudicative\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, because of his wife\u2019s websites and her personal conduct.\nAn allegation of criminal conduct is enough to raise a security concern under Guideline\nJ, but would be insufficient under federal law for a criminal court prosecution. For a\nfederal court to consider whether an individual committed a crime under any federal law,\nan indictment must be issued, charging her with an offense. Applicant\u2019s wife has never\nbeen arrested or charged with a crime related to her website or any other crime. If she\nhad been charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1462 and 1465, a federal court or jury\nwould first evaluate, as a whole, all the materials on websites 1 and 2, and make a\ndetermination under the obscenity test enunciated in Miller as to whether the materials\non websites 1 and 2, including the content of her members only site, are obscene.\nShould the materials provided in this record meet the Miller test, the federal court would\nlook at the evidence and decide if it is sufficient to show that the materials have been\ndistributed. The ultimate determination that websites 1 and 2 involve criminal activity\nwould be based on the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a\nmuch higher standard than the substantial evidence standard of proof used for security\nclearance determinations. The record evidence does not include a copy of the materials\ncontained in the members only site, which is acknowledged to be hardcore pornography\nbut argued as not obscene, for an independent assessment under the Miller test. In\naddition, the evidence of record fails to reflect any income earned by Applicant\u2019s wife\nfrom her website. The record evidence is insufficient to establish that Applicant\u2019s wife is\ninvolved in the distribution of obscenity.  The Government has not established a\n29\nsecurity concern under AG \u00b616(g). \nIn the instant case, the Government did not allege in the SOR that Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to inform his employer and the Government about his wife\u2019s pornographic\nwebsites as a security concern. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be\nconsidered: \n\nISCR Case No. 05-01820 at 3 n.4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2006)(citing ISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 8 (App. Bd.\n30\nMar. 17, 2003) and ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)).\n14\n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to\nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;\n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines\nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under\nDirective Section 6.3. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26,\n2006) (citations omitted). \nI have considered the non-SOR misconduct for the above purposes. Additionally,\nthe Appeal Board has determined that even though crucial security concerns are not\nalleged in the SOR, the Judge may consider those security concerns when they are\nrelevant and factually related to a disqualifying condition that was alleged in the SOR.  \n30\nApplicant acknowledged that he has not discussed his wife\u2019s pornography\nwebsites at work, saying the discussion of sexual issues in the work place is\ninappropriate. While true, his statement begs the issue of whether his employer has\nknowledge of her pornography websites. His supervisors gave no hint in their letters of\nrecommendation that they are aware of his wife\u2019s pornography websites or the reason\nfor the problems with Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Applicant agreed that individuals\nwith competent computer skills could trace through his wife\u2019s personal website, which\ncontains pictures of him, her pornography websites. He is aware that others can easily\nfind information on the Internet about his wife\u2019s pornography websites. Individuals\nseeking access to classified information could try to exploit, manipulate, or subject him\nto duress because he has not told his employer about the websites. His failure to share\nthis information about his wife\u2019s pornography websites with his employer creates a\nconcern that if this information is known, it may affect his personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing. While Applicant denies his wife is involved in an escort service, he\nfailed to provide information which shows she is no longer listed in the escort service\nwebsite. The Government has established a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(e).\nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00a7 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at # (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) The burden of disproving a\nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nHaving concluded that the Government has raised a security concern under AG \u00b6\n16(e), AG \u00b6 17 provides the following conditions by which the Applicant could mitigate\nsecurity concerns:\n\n15\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nAfter reviewing the above mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has not\nmitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns because he has not provided information\nthat indicates his employer is aware of his wife\u2019s websites. Even though federal\ninvestigators know about his wife\u2019s websites, he has not shown that this information has\nbeen shared with his immediate employer. He did not provide proof of his positive steps\nto reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Individuals\ninterested in obtaining classified information could pressure him because his employer\ndoes not know about the websites. Thus, he remains vulnerable to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress because of these websites. The other mitigating conditions are\nnot applicable to this case.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\n\n16\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00a7 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is less substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is\nhighly respected by his employer for his computer skills, particularly in cyber security.\nHe does not have financial problems nor has he been arrested for any reason. He\nworks hard and provides for his family.\nApplicant\u2019s security issues arise from his wife\u2019s decision to continue to maintain\ntwo pornography websites which she developed and which directly concern her. While\nshe has never been arrested and charged with any criminal conduct related to her\nwebsites, Applicant made a decision not to tell his employer about these websites. His\ndecision places his employer and the Government at risk because he has opened\nhimself up to possible pressure or coercion from individuals seeking access to classified\ninformation. His failure to advise his employer about these websites causes concern\nthat he is worried about his standing at work and in the community should people learn\nabout these websites. Additionally, his failure to inform his employer of his wife\u2019s\npornographic websites suggests that he fears a negative reaction by his employer and\nthe community should they be told about the websites, thus placing himself in a position\nto be exploited, coerced, or pressured to provide classified or sensitive information to\nthose who are not allowed access to the information.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\n\n17\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 25, 2008. He \nanswered the SOR in writing on the same day, admitting the factual allegations with \nexplanation.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on December 23, 2008.  The case was assigned to \nme on January 2, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 8, 2009, for a \nhearing on February 6, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government \noffered three exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 3, which were \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreceived without objection.  Applicant submitted one exhibit, marked Applicant Exhibit \n(App. Ex.) A, which was received without objection.  Applicant and two other witnesses \ntestified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nFebruary 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. (Tr. 28-30, Court Exhibit I)  The request and the attached \nsupporting documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record \nas a Court Exhibit.  Applicant had no objection to the request for administrative notice or \nthe attached documents.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings \nof Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR with explanation.  He also provided additional information to support his request \nfor eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and employed as a communications electronic engineer \nfor a defense contractor.  Applicant was born in Iran and received his elementary and \nhigh school education in Iran.  He came to the United States in April 1978 on a student \nvisa to pursue his education.  At the time, the Shah was the ruler of Iran.  The United \nStates and Iran enjoyed friendly relations and were allies.  Life in Iran at the time was \nvery nice.  The Shah was overthrown in 1979. \n \nApplicant received a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering in 1984 from a \nUnited States university.  He became a United States citizen on November 19, 1984.  \nApplicant desired to continue his education but did not have the financial resources to \nfund his continued education.  He enlisted in the United States Navy in March 1986.  \nAfter extensive training and schooling, he served on two ships as an electronics \ntechnician.  He served six years on active duty and received an honorable discharge \nupon completion of his enlistment in March 1992.  He held a top secret clearance while \nin the Navy.  He never informed his family in Iran that he was serving in the Navy or \nheld a security clearance.  He lived on the ship and only communicated with his family \nby telephone and not by mail (Tr. 30-34, 65-66; Gov. Ex. 1, Security Clearance \nApplication, e-QIP, dated April 3, 2007).    \n \nApplicant sought positions in the private sector after his discharge from the Navy.  \nHe was offered a position as a communications engineer for a defense contractor.  He \n\n \n3 \n \n \nworked for this company from 1992 until 1995, and held a top secret security clearance.  \nHe only told his family that he was an engineer for a company (Tr. 35-36). \n \nApplicant started working as an electronics engineer for a different defense \ncontractor in 1995.  He worked for this company until 2000 when he started working as \na communications electronic engineer for the predecessor company of his present \ndefense contractor employer.  He held a top secret security clearance for all of his \nemployers (Tr. 37-39). \n \nApplicant has never traveled outside the United States, except for deployments \non Navy ships since his arrival in the United States in 1978.  When his mother died a \nfew years ago, he did not return to Iran for her funeral.  He did not trust the Iranian \ngovernment and did not want to take chances because of their human rights record.  \nApplicant admits his father, two brothers, and a sister are citizens and residents of Iran.  \nHis father is 87 years old and a former college professor.  One brother sells construction \nequipment, and the other is not employed.  His sister is a housewife.  None of them \nhave any political connections or work for the Iranian government.  He used to talk to \nhis father by telephone about every six months.  After his father had a heart attack, he \ntalked to him more frequently, about once a month.  Since his father's health is now \ngood, even though he has a heart condition, he again only talks to him about every six \nmonths.  His last contact with his family was over a month ago when his brother in Iran \ncalled him with an update on his father's health.  In 2006, his wanted to assist with his \nfather's medical bills.  He withdrew funds from his 401K account and wire transferred \n$12,800 to his younger brother in Iran to help with his father's medical bills (Tr. 44-46; \n66-67; Gov. Ex. 2, Statement, dated march 12, 1993; Gov. Ex. 3, Testimonies, dated \nAugust 15, 2007). \n \nApplicant married a United States citizen who was a fellow student in 1981 while \nhe attended college.  The marriage ended in divorce in 1992.  He married again in \nMarch 2004 to a woman who was born in Iran and is a dual citizen of Iran and Sweden.  \nThey had been high school sweethearts in Iran but lost touch when Applicant came to \nthe United States.  She was able to contact him in 2003.  She has two daughters from a \nprior marriage who are citizens and residents of Sweden.  One is a student in Sweden \nand the other a student in the United States.  He has never spoken to his wife's mother \nwho is a citizen and resident of Iran.  His wife is a permanent resident and is seeking \nUnited States citizenship.  She hopes her application for citizenship can be processed \nthrough the system and granted in two or three years.  Applicant admits his wife's \nparents are citizens and residence of Iran (Tr. 63-66; Gov. Ex. 1, Security clearance \napplication, e-QIP, dated April 3, 2007; Gov. Ex. 3, Testimonies, dated August 15, 2007, \nat 3). \n \nApplicant talked to his production manager about visiting his family in Iran after \nhis father had a heart attack.  The production manager said he thought a trip would be \nfine and raised no issue with Applicant about travelling to Iran.  Since there did not \nseem to be any issue with his travel to Iran, Applicant did not conceal the fact he \nintended to apply for an Iranian passport.  His managers knew he anticipated applying \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfor an Iranian passport.  He applied for an Iranian passport through the Pakistan \nEmbassy.  He received the Iranian passport on December 19, 2006.  Afterward, he \ntalked to others in his company to facilitate work schedules if he made a trip to Iran.  \nWhile he talked about a trip, he did not make any travel plans.  He asked his program \nmanager if he was permitted to travel overseas since he possessed a security \nclearance.  The program manager told him that he did not see any problem.  Applicant \nalso had discussed potential overseas travel with an acquaintance from Iran who was \nan engineer for another government agency.  He was told that there did not seem to be \na problem with traveling overseas.  The individual had traveled to Iran and told \nApplicant that was permissible (Tr. 46-48).   \n \nApplicant advised his facility security officer (FSO) he had applied for and \nreceived an Iranian passport, and inquired if this was a security problem.  The FSO \ninquired of the company's contact with the Defense Security Service about the \npossession of the Iranian passport.  He suggested that she file a formal report.  Since \nApplicant's five year periodic update for access to classified information was due, the \nFSO requested that Applicant submit a security clearance application in March 2007.  \nApplicant disclosed on the application that he possessed an Iranian passport.  Applicant \nwas interviewed about the passport by a number of government investigation agencies \nincluding the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Naval Criminal Investigation \nService (NCIS).  Applicant answered all questions and cooperated with the \ninvestigators.  No changes were made at the time to his access to classified information \n(Tr. 45-54).   \n \nApplicant turned his Iranian passport over to his FSO after she was advised in \nNovember 2008 by DSS to have Applicant give her the passport.  He does not intend to \nask for it back and stated she could destroy it if she wanted.  He has no intent to travel \nto Iran even upon the death of his father.  Applicant does not own property in Iran and \ndoes not have a bank account there.  All of his finances are in the United States.  His \nonly house is one he purchased in the United States in 1996.  He is not Muslin, and in \nfact is not religious.  He does not consider himself an Iranian citizen.  He decided never \nto return to Iran after he learned of their poor human rights record.  He was not sure that \nif he went to Iran he would be allowed to leave.  When he became a United States \ncitizen in 1984, he cut all of his ties to Iran (Tr. 54-58, 66-68). \n \nThe FSO for Applicant's company testified that she has been the FSO for almost \nten years, and has known Applicant for this entire time.  She never had any reason to \ndoubt his allegiance to the United States or his protection of national security \ninformation.  Her employees receive annual training on their obligations and \nresponsibilities for protecting classified information.  As the FSO, she maintains liaison \nwith the Defense Security Service.  She was aware that Applicant had applied for and \nreceived an Iranian passport.  Applicant informed her because he said he may decide to \ntravel to Iran to visit his sick father.  She informed DSS and was asked to initiate a full \nreport.  She initiated Applicant's five year periodic update of his security clearance.  She \nfiled a formal report with Applicant's security clearance application which started an \ninvestigation from various government investigative agencies.  Applicant had sensitive \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncompartmented information (SCI) access in addition to his top secret clearance.  After \ncompletion of the investigation, Applicant's security clearance status was not changed \nand he continued to have access to classified information.  She expected that if there \nwas any issue, the investigators would confiscate Applicant's Iranian passport, but they \ndid not.  Applicant voluntarily gave her his Iranian passport in November 2008.  It is \nlocked in a safe in her office.  He has never requested return of the Iranian passport (Tr. \n77-96) \n \nThe group senior vice-president for Applicant's company testified that he is a \nretired Navy Master Chief with degrees in electronics and physics, and engineering \nmanagement.  In the Navy, he served as a cryptologist and was the technical adviser \nfor cryptology to the Chief of Naval Operations.  He has held top level security \nclearances since 1969.  He is aware of the security clearance requirements concerning \nforeign family members and spouses since he had family members that were citizens \nand residents of foreign countries when he first entered active duty, and he later married \na foreign national.  He retired from the Navy in 1991 and started working for the \npredecessor company of his present employer.  As the business manager, he is \nresponsible for the largest division in his company which includes Applicant's area.  He \nhas known Applicant since 1995 and had almost daily contact with him at the start of \ntheir relationship.  As the company grew and Applicant worked in various positions in \nthe general geographic area for the company, their contact has not been daily.  He sees \nApplicant often and hears about his performance from Applicant's supervisors.  \nApplicant's work product is excellent and he is known for the quality of his work \nperformance.  His technical skills are held in very high regard.  He has been a valuable \nasset to the company.   \n \nThe witness stated he has been interviewed a number of times for updates for \nApplicant's security clearance.  He knows of Applicant's anger at the events of 9/11 and \nalso knows about indignities he suffered because of his ancestry.  The witness has \nbeen associated with people with very high security clearances and does not know of a \nmore dedicated individual to the United States than Applicant.  The witness received \nsignificant training in his career to detect those that might have issues of loyalty and \nallegiance to the United States.  He has no questions about Applicant and would gladly \nserve with him in the most sensitive positions.  It is possible for Applicant to be subject \nto foreign influence because he has family members in Iran.  However, he is convinced \nApplicant would react only in ways favourable to the United States.  Applicant would \nimmediately report any problems.  He is certain that Applicant has no preference or \nallegiance for Iran.  He endorses Applicant for access to classified information (Tr. 98-\n110) \n \nApplicant presented fourteen letters of recommendation.  The letters were from \nsupervisors and co-workers.  All of these letters attested to Applicants excellent work \nperformance.  They all noted that he is a proud and valued United States citizen.  They \nconsidered him trustworthy and reliable (App. Ex. A, Letters, various dates). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIran is a country that has been hostile to the United States since the 1979 \nrevolution that overthrew the former pro-western government.  Iran\u2019s support for terrorist \ngroups has long concerned the United States.  Iran\u2019s human rights practices are also a \nconcern for the United States.  The Iranian theocratic government has repressed its \npeople, pursued weapons of mass destruction, initiated a nuclear program that may \ninclude nuclear weapons, and continues to support terrorism in Iraq and around the \nworld.  Iran is known to conduct intelligence operations and economic espionage \nagainst the United States.  There is no direct evidence in the record concerning Iranian \nespionage activity towards or within the United States, but this hostile relationship \nsupports the inference that Iran would seek to damage or counter United States military \ncapabilities by seeking to obtain classified or sensitive information when possible.  The \nUnited States Department of State warns United States citizens, particularly United \nStates citizens of Iranian origin, to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran.  Iran \ndoes not recognize renunciation of citizenship by those born there, and has detained \nand harassed naturalized United States citizens traveling there.  Applicant is aware of \nthe dangerous nature of the regime and intentionally has not returned to Iran.  The \ncontinued support for terrorism and human rights violations contributed to President \nBush\u2019s strong criticism of Iran in his 2002 State of the Union message and his \ndesignation of Iran as one of the \u201cAxis of Evil.\u201d  Iran is a nation whose interests are \ninimical to the United States.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interests.  Adjudication under this guideline can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is location, including but not limited to, such consideration as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism (AG \u00b6 6).  Applicant's family \nmembers and his relationship with them has been known for the over twenty years he \nhas been granted access to classified information.  Even though this relationship has \nbeen known and has not been considered a factor in denial of access to classified \ninformation, it does not mean it should not be considered now.  However, his access to \nclassified information in the past under these circumstances is a positive factor to \nconsider in determining if access should be continued.  The only factors that have \nchanged from the previous granting of access to classified information is that Applicant \napplied for, received, and possesses an Iranian passport, and that he sent funds to Iran \nto help with his father's medical expenses. \n \n \nApplicant has infrequent contact with his father and siblings who are citizens and \nresidents of Iran.  He has not visited Iran or seen his family members since he left Iran \n\n \n8 \n \n \nin 1978.  They have never visited the United States.  He talks by telephone with his \nfamily members about every six months.  The last contact he had with a family member \nin Iran was a telephone call from a brother about six weeks ago telling him of his father's \nmedical condition.  He sent his brother significant funds to assist with his father's \nmedical expenses in June 2006.  Even though his contact with his family in Iran has \nbeen minimal, it raises security concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying \nConditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 79(a) \"Contact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\"; and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) \"Connections to a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation\".   \n \n \nThe mere existence of a foreign family member is not sufficient.  The nature of \nApplicant\u2019s contact with the family member must be examined to determine whether it \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.  \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative term denoting increased risk over some normally \nexisting risk that can be said to be inherent anytime a family member lives subject to a \nforeign government.  One factor that heightens the risk in Applicant\u2019s case is the nature \nof the Iranian government and its hostility towards the United States. \n \n \nApplicant raised facts to mitigate the security concerns for his family in Iran.  I \nhave considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8(a) \"the nature \nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe U.S.\"; FI MC AG \u00b6 8(b) \"there is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest\"; and FI MC AG \u00b6 8(c) \"Contact or communication \nwith foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could \ncreated a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\". \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal Board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a \nchoice between the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States.  \n(See, ISCR Case No. 03-17620, App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006; ISCR Case No. 03-24933, \nApp. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005; ISCR Case No. 03-02382, App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005; and ISCR \nCase No. 03-15205, App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not \n\n \n9 \n \n \npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the \nnew guidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. \n \n \nThe nature of the government of Iran, its disregard for human rights, and its \nintent to seek information on United States technology places a heavy burden on \nApplicant in mitigating the disqualifying conditions and the security concerns.  There is a \nrebuttable presumption that Applicant's relationship with his father and siblings in Iran is \nclose.  His father is a retired 87 year old professor who has no contact or relationship \nwith the Iranian government.  His siblings have no position or relationship with the \nIranian government.  While the circumstances of his relationship with his family in Iran \nand their position in Iran may make it unlikely Applicant can be placed in a position to \nchoose between them and his loyalty to the United States, there could be a \ncircumstance where Applicant is placed in a position of having to choose between his \nfamily members and the interests of the United States because of the nature 0f the \nIranian government.  Accordingly, FI MC AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nIt is clear from Applicant\u2019s testimony that he has a relationship with his family in \nIran.  Applicant realizes that there is a risk for him to go to Iran.  Because of this \nrealization, he has not returned to Iran since leaving in 1978, even when his mother \ndied.  Since Applicant is concerned about a visiting Iran, there is likelihood that his \nfamily in Iran could create the risk for him of foreign influence or exploitation.  Even \nthough the relationship is infrequent but more than casual, FI DC AG \u00b6 8 (c) does not \napply.   \n \n \nApplicant has little, if any, sense of loyalty to Iran.  He spent only his early years \nin Iran.  The revolutionary government of Iran came into being after he left Iran.  The \ntestimony of those that have known him for many years establishes that he has a deep \nsense of loyalty and admiration for the United States and its way of life.  There was \ntestimony from a retired military member who understands a sense of loyalty and \nobligation.  There are letters recommending his continued access to classified \ninformation from colleagues and friends working in the defense industry who hold \nsecurity clearances and understand the requirements to receive access to classified \ninformation.  Applicant came to the United States as a teenager and received his \nprofessional education here.  He became a United States citizen as soon as he could, \nand has been successful working in the defense industries.  He served honorably in the \nUnited States Navy for six years and held a security clearance while on active duty.  He \nsees the United States as offering him freedom, justice, and tolerance with an \nopportunity to reach his potential.  He served in the defense industry for over 17 years \nwith a top level security clearance the entire time.  While he provided funds to assist \nwith the medical care of his father, he sent the funds as a son and not to assist the \ngovernment of Iran.  He left it to the discretion of his family members as to how the \nfunds should be used.  Applicant's sense of loyalty or obligation is not to Iran but to the \nUnited States.  A conflict of interest in this case is extremely unlikely.  In balancing all of \nthe factors mentioned and considered above, I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the \n\n \n10 \n \n \nUnited States is such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the United States interest.  FI MC AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.  Applicant has met his heavy \nburden to show that his contacts with his family in Iran do not cause a security concern.  \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated security concerns rising from his contact with his \nfamily in Iran.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Preference \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then he may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States (AG \u00b6 9).  Iran considers \nhim an Iranian citizen because he was born in Iran.  Applicant applied for an Iranian \npassport after obtaining United States citizenship.  He applied for the passport to ease \nhis entry into Iran should he travel to Iran upon the death of his father.  He has never \nused the passport.  He told the authorities in his company of his intent to obtain the \npassport and sought advice.  He told his supervisors and FSO of the possession of the \npassport.  He cooperated with security investigators concerning the passport.  Even \nunder these circumstances, his possession of the Iranian passport raises Foreign \nPreference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) \"Exercise of any right, privilege, \nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the \nforeign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport.\"   \n \nApplicant raised Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC) AG \u00b6 11(b) \n\"The individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship\", and FP MC \nAG \u00b6 11(e) \"The passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\"  Applicant does not know of any procedure \naccepted by the Iranian government to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  He thought he \nrenounced his Iranian citizenship when he became a United States citizen in 1984.  He \ndoes not consider himself an Iranian citizen.  The Iranian passport is a current passport \nbut has been turned over to his Facility Security Officer, a cognizant security official.  He \nhas told her and others that the passport can be destroyed.  He has no intention of \nasking for it to be returned to him.  Applicant has mitigated security concerns for foreign \npreference raised by his current Iranian passport. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n11 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I carefully considered all of the \ncircumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \nwell as the following factors in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d \nconcept requires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single \nitem in isolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness.  Applicant has a relationship with his family members in Iran \nbecause he occasionally talks to them by telephone and has sent funds for his father's \nmedical care.  These simple facts alone might be sufficient to raise security concerns \nover Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  However, mere \nfamily ties with people in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B.  Whether an applicant\u2019s family ties in a foreign country pose a \nsecurity risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and \ncircumstances of the family ties.   \n \nApplicant has strong loyalties to the United States and a strong lack of loyalty for \nIran.  He has been granted access to classified information for over 23 years even \nthough his relationship with his family members was a known factor.  He is regarded as \nloyal, trustworthy, and reliable by those that work with and know him.  Many are former \nmilitary and government officials.  They know and understand the qualifications for \naccess to classified information and have themselves made judgments on people for \naccess to classified information.  Applicant has established his deep loyalty to the \nUnited States.  He established that he has no loyalty to Iran or its government.  He \nrelinquished control of his Iranian passport and turned it over to his FSO.  He has \ninformed her and all of his company officials that the passport can be destroyed and he \ndoes not want it back.  Overall, on balance, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has met the particularly heavy burden of \nmitigating all potential security concerns arising from his family member in Iran as well \nas his applying for and receiving a current Iranian passport.  Accordingly I find that \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence and foreign \npreference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n12 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on January 21, 2008 \n(Government Exhibit (GX) 4). On March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines J \nand E (GX 1). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 20, 2009; answered it on March 31, 2009; \nand requested determination on the record without a hearing. DOHA received his \nresponse on April 3, 2009. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written \ncase on April 28, 2009. On April 29, 2009, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s \nevidence. Applicant received the FORM on May 5, 2009, but he did not respond. The \ncase was assigned to me on August 12, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.e, and he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.f and 2.a. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior staff software engineer for a federal contractor. \nHe has worked for his current employer since May 2007. He is a college graduate. His \nsecurity clearance application states he received a security clearance while working for \na previous employer, a defense contractor (GX 4 at 28). The record does not reflect \nwhether he currently holds a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was married in August 1974. He and his wife have a 28-year-old \ndaughter, a 26-year-old son, and a 20-year-old daughter.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he was arrested for disorderly \nconduct in May 1990 and was fined. In a response to DOHA interrogatories in \nSeptember 2008, Applicant explained that this incident arose as a result of an argument \nbetween his spouse and a neighbor about rock-throwing incidents involving their \nchildren (GX 8 at 3).  \n \nApplicant also admitted he was arrested in September 1995 and charged with \nassault. He explained to a security investigator that this incident arose out of a domestic \nargument. While he was driving, his wife began punching him in the arm with her fist, \nand he accidently backhanded her in the face while trying to deflect the blows (GX 5 at \n3). \n \nApplicant admitted he was the subject of a domestic disturbance incident report \nin September 2005 and two domestic disturbance incident reports in September 2006. \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in September 2008, he explained that these \nincidents arose from arguments with his younger daughter. Both had undiagnosed \nbipolar disorder and would engage in loud arguments with occasional physical contact, \ncausing Applicant\u2019s wife to summon the police. Both Applicant and his daughter are \nreceiving psychiatric care and responding well to medication (GX 6 at 2). His daughter \nno longer lives them (GX 6 at 3).  \n \n\n \n3\nCourt records reflect that Applicant was arrested in September 2007 after a \ndomestic disturbance, and he was charged in December 2007 with criminal damage \nand disorderly conduct (GX 7). This incident occurred when Applicant intentionally \nbroke his wife\u2019s cell phone during an argument. Both Applicant and his wife were \ncharged with disorderly conduct. Court records reflect that he pleaded guilty pursuant to \na plea agreement (GX 8), and the finding of guilty based on his plea was deferred. He \nwas placed on unsupervised probation for 24 months, ordered not to possess alcoholic \nbeverages, and required to obtain 52 weeks of psychological and alcohol counseling \n(GX 9). His psychiatrist certified that he has been \u201ccompliant\u201d with his treatment, is \nmaking progress, is more pleasant, and has maintained sobriety (GX 3 at 3). He will be \non probation until January 25, 2010. \n \n \nOn his security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23f, \nasking about charges or arrests not covered elsewhere on the form (GX 4 at 26). He did \nnot disclose his arrest in September 2007 and charges of criminal damage and \ndisorderly conduct that were preferred in December 2007 (GX 7). In his answer to the \nSOR, he admitted he was notified by mail on December 19, 2007, that a complaint had \nbeen filed against him for the September 2007 incident and he was required to appear \nin court on January 25, 2008. He stated he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question because he \nthought he was not \u201ccharged\u201d until he was arrested or appeared in court. When he was \ninterviewed by a security investigator on March 11, 2008, he disclosed the details of the \nincident and the disposition of the charges. He told the investigator he did not disclose \nthe incident on his security clearance application because he was never arrested and, \nat the time he submitted his application, he did not know if he would be charged (GX 5 \nat 3). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n \n4\n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges an arrest for disorderly conduct in May 1990 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), an \narrest for assault in September 1995 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), three domestic disturbances in 2005 \nand 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e), and an arrest and charges of criminal damage and \ndisorderly conduct in September 2007 that resulted in 24 months of unsupervised \nprobation that will run through January 25, 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). It also alleges Applicant \nintentionally omitted the latest charges from his security clearance application (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a).  \n \n\n \n5\n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). A disqualifying condition also may be raised if \u201cthe \nindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(d). Applicant\u2019s criminal record \nraises AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c), and (d), shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The neighborhood argument \nthat occurred in May 1990 happened long ago. Applicant has not been involved in any \nsimilar incidents, and it is not likely to recur. The domestic violence in September 1995 \nalso happened long ago, but it is part of a pattern of recurring domestic violence that \ncontinued through September 2007. Now that Applicant\u2019s younger daughter no longer \nlives at home, recurrence of violence with her is unlikely, but the evidence does not \njustify a conclusion that recurrence of the domestic violence with his wife is unlikely. He \nis still on probation for the latest incident, and it is too soon to determine whether he will \nadhere to the therapy to control his bipolar disorder. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is \nestablished for the May 1990 incident but not for the remaining incidents. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on criminal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). As noted above, too little time has passed since the latest criminal conduct, and \nApplication is still on probation for that conduct. He has presented no evidence of his \nemployment record or community involvement. The evidence from his psychiatrist \ncontains no prognosis for the future. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant intentionally failed to disclose the arrest and charges \nrelated to his domestic violence incident in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n6\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a \nfalsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence \nas a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation is that he did not know he had been charged, even \nthough he was informed in writing that a complaint had been filed and he was required \nto appear in court to answer it. He is a mature, well-educated adult. He is not a \nneophyte regarding the criminal justice system. I find his explanation implausible and \nnot credible. I am satisfied he knew he was pending charges but chose not to disclose \nit. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Although Applicant entered his guilty plea and was placed on \nprobation four days after submitting his application, there is no evidence he attempted \nto correct his omission until he was confronted by a security investigator two months \nlater and questioned about his failure to disclose the arrest and charges on his \napplication. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct can be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification of his application was serious because it tended to undermine the integrity \nof the security clearance process. It was recent, did not happen under unique \ncircumstances, and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also can be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). During his security interview in March 2008 \nand in his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the omission from his application, but \n\n \n7\nhe has not acknowledged that it was intentional. He is receiving counseling from a \npsychiatrist, but the psychiatrist\u2019s report, while generally favorable, stops short of a \nfavorable prognosis. His behavior is constrained by the fact that he is still on probation. \nToo little time has passed to warrant a conclusion that his behavior is unlikely to recur. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of domestic violence and disorderly conduct. As a \ncondition of his ongoing probation, he is receiving treatment, but it is too soon to \nconclude that he is rehabilitated. His lack of candor on his security clearance application \nraises serious doubts about his reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on criminal conduct and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applican \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On April 28, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 20, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan\nMetz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by admitting\n\n1The prior case also included allegations under Guidelines F and J, which are not at issue in this case.\n2Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 4(a); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22.   \nhearsay evidence that denied Applicant his right of cross-examination; and whether the Judge erred\nin his application of the mitigating conditions.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm\nthe decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is the chief engineer for\na company owned by his wife.  He holds a Master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and has\ncompleted the course work for a Ph.D. \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s request for special access was denied by another Government agency.\nThe reasons for the denial of special access were several instances of misconduct which were\nsubsequently alleged in the SOR in the case at issue here.1  \nThis misconduct alleged in the SOR included the following: (1) Applicant employed foreign\nnationals whom be suspected were illegal aliens; (2) he failed to report their income to the IRS; (3)\nhe overcharged his employer for mileage from 1985 to 2006; (4) he purchased merchandise with his\nemployer\u2019s funds, returned some of it for cash refunds, then used the cash to purchase personal\nitems; (5) he was occasionally undercharged for purchases but did not advise the sellers; and (6) he\nunlawfully discharged a firearm on his property from 1993 to 2006, aware that such conduct was\nunlawful.  Additionally, the SOR alleged the special access denial by the other Government agency\nas a security concern.  The Judge concluded that his findings raised disqualifying conditions under\nGuideline E.\n  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge stated that the incidents were of varying\ndegrees of seriousness.  He stated that Applicant\u2019s having employed household workers while\nsuspecting that they were in the country illegally, and not reporting their income to the IRS, was,\nin and of itself, a sufficient reason to deny him a clearance.  When considered in light of the other\nincidents, this conduct raised security concerns that Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence was not\nsufficient to mitigate.  Accordingly, the Judge denied Applicant a clearance.\nUpon appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred by admitting six documents,\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 7 through 12.  He argues that they were inadmissible hearsay and denied\nhim his right of cross-examination under the Executive Order and the Directive.  These documents\nwere prepared by the other Government agency in its denial of special access to Applicant.  The\nchallenged documents consist of five summaries of interviews of Applicant (GE 7 through 11) and\na Clearance Decision Statement (GE 12).  \nExecutive Order 10865 and Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22, with slight differences in wording, each\nprovide that an applicant has a right to cross-examine a person who has made a statement adverse\nto him or her on a controverted issue.2  Applicant states that the challenged documents are\nstatements adverse to him and, by admitting them, the Judge denied him his right of confrontation.\nAs stated above, this right applies only as to controverted issues.  See ISCR Case No. 97-\n\n3Applicant admitted each of the specific allegations in the SOR, \u201cwith mitigating circumstances.\u201d  He\ncharacterized the mitigating circumstances as his full cooperation with the security clearance process and  his candid and\nhonest responses to all inquiries.  He stated that, to the extent that his record raised security concerns, he had \u201ctaken\nappropriate steps to address all prior instances of personal conduct stated in the Statement of Reasons\u201d and that his\nactions in response to the security concerns are sufficient to mitigate them.  Therefore, Applicant\u2019s answer does not\nquestion the factual accuracy of the allegations.  The Judge agreed that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion as\nto one of the allegations, SOR \u00b6 1(e), and found in Applicant\u2019s favor on it.\n4ISCR Case No. 03-06770 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2004); ISCR Case No. 06-06496 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2009); ISCR\nCase No. 93-1234 (App. Bd. May 19, 1995).  Additionally, ISCR Case No. 02-30913 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2005) states that\nsecurity clearance applications are admissible under \u00b6 E3.1.20.\n0765 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1998).  In this case, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR.  Answer\nto SOR, dated June 16, 2009.3  Therefore, the facts contained in these allegations were not\ncontroverted.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14 (\u201cDepartment Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses\nand other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted\u201d); ISCR Case\nNo. 08-10012 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2010) (\u201cApplicant admitted this SOR allegation, relieving\nDepartment Counsel of any further requirement of proof\u201d).  Under the facts of this case, a right of\ncross-examination under the cited provisions of the Executive Order and the Directive does not\napply.\nMoreover, a right of cross-examination is not violated when documents are admissible\nelsewhere under the Directive.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 provides that \n[o]fficial records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business,\nother than DoD personnel background reports of investigation (ROI), may be\nreceived and considered by the Administrative Judge without authenticating\nwitnesses, provided that such information has been furnished by an investigative\nagency pursuant to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of\nDefense, or the Department or Agency head concerned, to safeguard classified\ninformation . . . An ROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided it\nis otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence[.] (internal citations\nomitted)  \nWe have cited this provision in support of admission of a variety of documents, including\npolice reports, criminal investigation reports by the military services, and Defense Investigative\nService facility inspection reports.4  We have also held that a Clearance Decision Statement by the\nsame Government agency that denied Applicant\u2019s special access is admissible as substantive\nevidence under this provision of the Directive.  Because a Clearance Decision Statement is not an\nROI, it may be admitted without authentication.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 4, 7 (App.\nBd. Aug. 8, 2005).  Therefore, the Judge did not err in admitting GE 12.  \nGE 7 through 11, however, are reports of the other agency\u2019s personnel background\ninvestigation of Applicant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 8 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2004).  Insofar\nas the other agency falls within the ambit of the DoD, these exhibits are ROIs which could not be\nadmitted without an authenticating witness, as required by the Directive.  However, at the hearing,\nApplicant stipulated as to the authenticity of these exhibits, thereby relieving the Government of the\n\n5\u201cAdmin. Judge: [Applicant\u2019s Attorney], do you have any objection to the government\u2019s characterization of\nExhibits 1 through 14 and the cover sheet that it provided? [Attorney]: The characterization, no, your Honor.  And we\nadmit and stipulate that they\u2019re authentic and genuine documents.\u201d  Tr. at 20.  \n6We have considered the questions of whether GE 12, by relying so extensively on GE 7 through 11, has thereby\nincorporated these documents by reference, or whether these documents would be admissible under Fed. Rule Evid. 106,\nwhich codifies the doctrine of completeness.  In light of our disposition of the issue on appeal, we do not need to resolve\nthese questions.  \nresponsibility of calling an authenticating witness.5  Furthermore, we conclude that these exhibits\nare otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.  First, they consist solely of\nApplicant\u2019s responses to interview questions.  Because they were offered by Department Counsel,\nthey constitute admissions by a party-opponent and, therefore, are excluded from the definition of\nhearsay.  Fed. Rule Evid. 801 (d)(2).  Second, even if they are hearsay, they are admissible as public\nrecords and reports under Fed. Rule Evid. 803(8).  We conclude that the Judge did not err in\nadmitting GE 7 through 11.\nFinally, even if the Judge did err in admitting the challenged documents, the information\ncontained therein is repeated almost verbatim in GE 12, which was properly admitted.  Therefore,\neven if the Judge had declined to admit these exhibits, his overall decision would most likely have\nbeen the same.

In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge stated that the incidents were of varying degrees of seriousness. He stated that Applicant\u2019s having employed household workers while suspecting that they were in the country illegally, and not reporting their income to the IRS, was, in and of itself, a sufficient reason to deny him a clearance. When considered in light of the other incidents, this conduct raised security concerns that Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence was not sufficient to mitigate. Accordingly, the Judge denied Applicant a clearance. Upon appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred by admitting six documents, Government Exhibits (GE) 7 through 12.

He is a 52-year-old chief engineer for a\ncompany solely owned by his wife, but founded by them in November 2002. Because\nthe company is solely owned by his wife, the company qualifies for preferential\ntreatment contracting with the federal government. The company specializes in complex\nelectrical applications. From August 2000 to November 2002, Applicant was a principal\nin a different start-up company. Applicant also created a subchapter S corporation in\n1998 (GE 7). Applicant has bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering,\nand completed doctoral studies, but has yet to write the thesis to get his degree. He\nheld a clearance in a variety of jobs from 1985 until his clearance was suspended in\nMarch 2008 because of the issues raised in the SOR (GE 3).\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen. They have been married over 22\nyears, and have three children together, plus a toddler they adopted in 2008. Before\nadopting, they fostered 15 children with ages ranging from nine to 13. His wife is fluent\nin Spanish. They are both very involved in their church, where he serves as a deacon.\nIn November 2006, Applicant\u2019s request for special access at another government\nagency was denied because of the issues raised in the SOR, as well as for conduct\ncited under the criminal conduct and financial considerations guidelines that are not\nalleged in the SOR (GE 12).  Applicant appealed the decision in March 2007 (GE 13),\n3\nand his appeal was (GE 14). He did not exercise his further right to appeal.\nApplicant\u2019s company had sponsored him for special access in October 2005 (GE\n1, 6). Between December 2005 (GE 7) and August 2006 (GE 11), Applicant underwent\nfive lifestyle polygraphs to resolve issues that arose during the interviews (Tr. 101).\nApplicant was fully cooperative, and he dredged up every conceivable piece of\npotentially adverse information, including some he thought silly. However, the issues\ncould not be resolved to the agency\u2019s satisfaction. Each interview was summarized (GE\n7\u201311), and the information condensed in the agency\u2019s decision statement (GE 12).\nDOHA alleged, the Government\u2019s exhibits establish, and Applicant admits that:\nthe other agency denied his request for special access (SOR 1.a.), he employed several\nforeign nationals who he suspected were illegal aliens (SOR 1.b.), he failed to report\ntheir income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from about 1990 to 2006 (SOR 1.c.),\nhe overcharged his company for mileage from about 1985 to 2006 (SOR 1.d.), he\ndeliberately under-reported his work hours between 1996 and 2002 (SOR 1.e.), he\nbought items with company money from 2002 to 2006, returned some of them for cash\nrefunds, then used the cash to pay for personal items (SOR 1.f.), he was occasionally\nundercharged for purchases but did not report to the store (SOR 1.g.), and he unlawfully\ndischarged a gun on his property from 1993 to 2006, while being aware of the\n\n3\nunlawfulness since 1999 (SOR 1.h.). The adverse conduct ranges from serious to not\nvery. Applicant\u2019s explanations run the gamut from reasonable to not very.\nThe most serious of the conduct is Applicant\u2019s employment of illegal aliens and\nfailure to report their income to the IRS from about 1990 to 2006. Applicant hired a\nseries of nannies and housekeepers to watch his children, clean his home, and look\nafter his elderly parents when they moved in with Applicant. He also hired a yard man\naround 2002 to do regular yard work at his home. He  stated (Tr. 131, GE 5) that he had\nno actual knowledge that they were illegal aliens, and believed until about 2005 that\nthey were independent contractors and not employees (Tr. 132-133). A more accurate\ncharacterization is that Applicant assiduously avoided that actual knowledge, but knew\nmany facts about his employees that all-but-confirmed their illegal status.\nApplicant stated in a May 2008 sworn statement (GE 5) that he never accepted\nfraudulent documents, but also never asked anyone who worked for him their\nimmigration status, nationality, or citizenship. However, in December 2005, he stated\nthat the workers presented him with social security cards that he nevertheless\nsuspected were fraudulent. He paid these workers in cash (GE 7, 9), and did not file the\nappropriate paperwork with the IRS because he suspected doing so would make them\ndisappear (GE 7). In a May 2006 interview conducted under oath (GE 10), he reiterated\nthat he paid his workers cash, suspected that they were not U.S. citizens, and did not\nreport his payments to the IRS because it \u201cwas inconvenient and too much trouble to fill\nout the appropriate paperwork.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s wife did all the actual hiring because all the workers were native\nSpanish speakers and spoke little or no English. The workers came to them by word of\nmouth, through recommendations to his wife. In one instance in July 2006, Applicant\nlent his yard man (whose last name is unknown to Applicant) $1,000 in cash to bring his\nwife to this country. The yard man had worked for him long enough that he felt he\nshould help him. He later hired the yard man\u2019s wife (whose last name he also does not\nknow) as a housekeeper (Tr. 149-151, GE 11). He paid them both in cash. He\nsuspected that the yard man and his wife were both illegal aliens, and that the $1,000\nwas used to smuggle her into the U.S. However, he told his wife he did not to know any\nof the particulars. The yard man later repaid the loan, in cash. Applicant pays his\nworkers in cash because the workers either do not have checking accounts or are in the\nU.S. illegally. Applicant eventually hired a tax attorney to try and sort out his obligations\nto the IRS, but without full names or social security numbers (SSNs), there is little\nchance of his being able to report any of the money he paid his workers to the IRS.\nIn his March 2007 appeal to the other agency (GE 13), Applicant identified six\nwomen who worked for him between 1990 and 2006. He paid them from $100 to $300\nper week, for a total of nearly $45,000. The last names and SSNs of five of them are\nunknown to Applicant. He does not know the SSN of the one woman whose last name\nhe knows. Applicant did not know the last name of his yard man, and suspects that any\nname he would have been given would have been false (GE 11).\n\n4\nApplicant lives in a housing development in a quasi-rural part of the state. His\nhouse backs up to a woods, and he is plagued by groundhogs. From 1993 to 2006, he\nshot groundhogs with his .22 caliber rifle, always taking care to shoot toward the woods.\nHowever, state law prohibits discharging a firearm within a given distance from other\nresidences, and Applicant\u2019s neighbors were within that distance from his house. Initially,\nApplicant was unaware of the state law, but he continued to shoot groundhogs even\nafter he became aware of it in 1999.\nOver the years, Applicant has engaged in some questionable business practices.\nFrom 1985 to 2002, he rounded up his mileage on company expense reports, so his\nemployers were overcharged. However, he probably only broke even because of the\ntimes he did not expense mileage he was eligible to claim. When he and his partners\nfounded their start-up company in 2000, they all reported working 40 hour weeks for\npayment purposes, because they were salaried employees, but the company needed to\nkeep records. Forty hours was seldom the standard work week. Most weeks it was well\nmore than 40; some weeks as few as 35.\nWhen Applicant and his wife founded their company in November 2002, they\nwere the only employees. Applicant did a lot of the construction work himself, and the\ncompany record-keeping practices were not very well controlled. On occasion, Applicant\nwould return excess supplies bought with company money, and use the cash or store\ncredit for personal expenses rather than return the money to corporate accounts. But\nthe net effect of this practice was to turn what would otherwise be income to him into a\ncorporate expense, deductible against corporate income. From 1990 to 2006, Applicant\nwould purchase items from stores and discover when he got home that he had not been\ncharged for some items. He did not return the items to the store or return to the store to\npay for the items. Most of the time the money involved was insignificant, but on one\noccasion at least, Applicant kept an $80 door.\nApplicant and his wife engage in fairly sophisticated tax and business planning.\nThe company they founded is solely owned by her to take advantage of preferential\ntreatment given to companies owned by women (GE 4). Applicant owns the building\nthat houses the company, and his wife pays fair-market rent, albeit on the high side.\nThis perfectly-legal arrangement has benefits for both the Applicant and the company.\nThe rent paid is a business expense of the company and income to the Applicant which\ncan be offset by his business expenses of owning the property. In addition, Applicant\nand his wife take advantage of IRS gift tax rules to make tax-advantaged monetary gifts\nto their children.\nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses, who include several business associates and his\npastor for nearly 20 years, consider him honest and trustworthy, and eligible for a\nclearance. His business references, in particular, note his adherence to security\nprotocols by removing himself from business meetings where the discussions moved\ninto classified areas above his clearance level. He no longer engages in any of the\nconduct raised by the SOR.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n5\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is\nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case\ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E and\nthe whole-person concept, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns, except\nregarding the 35-hour work weeks alleged in SOR 1.e. Applicant was a full-time,\nsalaried employee of a company he co-founded. The 40-hour work weeks reported by\nApplicant and his co-founders were an accounting device used to show that they were\nall full-time employees on the company\u2019s books. They earned no overtime. Any weeks\nthat were actually less than 40 hours were more than covered by the many weeks that\nwere actually more than 40 hours\u2014weeks that would be routine in a start-up company.\nNo fraud was intended by Applicant nor experienced by the company. I find SOR 1.e for\nApplicant.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s other employment adventures and his violation of state gun\nlaw raise serious security concerns. Distilled to its essence, Applicant\u2019s misconduct\n\u2014whether relatively minor (overstating mileage expense or not returning or paying for\nitems he had not been charged for) or more serious (hiring illegal aliens and not\nreporting \ntheir \nincome \nto \nthe \nIRS, \nand \ndeliberately \nviolating \nstate \ngun\n\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n5\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ;\n\u201cW hen viewed individually, the actions referenced in the denial statement may appear relatively minor,\n6\nhowever, when viewed in total, a more disturbing pattern of behavior appears. W hat is particularly concerning\nabout [Applicant\u2019s] conduct over the years has been what appears to be his belief that laws, rules, and\nregulations do not apply to him when they are not convenient.\u201d (GE 14)\n6\nlaw)\u2014demonstrates a consistent pattern of poor judgment and untrustworthiness over\nmany years, including years he held a clearance.  Although the other agency\u2019s special\n5\naccess decision is not binding on my adjudication of his underlying clearance both\nbecause that  decision involved additional adverse information not alleged in the SOR\nand because of the additional sensitivity of information in special access programs, the\nreasoning is particularly apt.  Applicant is an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs take risks.\n6\nThey have little time for rules and regulations that they perceive as inconvenient or silly.\nThey will cut corners to get the job done, whether for themselves or their clients. This is\nprecisely what Applicant did.\nApplicant knew, or should have known, that he was hiring illegal aliens for a\nvariety of jobs at his home. The circumstantial evidence alone confirms that he believed\nthem to be illegal aliens: referrals by word of mouth, employees who speak little or no\nEnglish, whose last names are unknown, who present no employment documents (or\nsuspected fraudulent ones), who are paid only in cash, for whom he did not file IRS\npaperwork because it was burdensome and would make his employees disappear, and\nfor whom Applicant chose to not acquire any of this missing information\u2014going so far\nas to tell his wife (the native Spanish speaker) not to tell him anything that would\nconfirm his suspicions. This is plausible deniability to an unbelievable extreme. It\ncontrasts vividly with the meticulous way he established his businesses.\nSimilarly, Applicant knew, or should have known, that his employees were not\nindependent contractors and that he had to report their income to the IRS. Much of the\nsame circumstantial evidence above demonstrates his knowledge. The workers came to\nhim through individual referrals, with no apparent company affiliation. Applicant used\ntheir services on a frequent and recurring basis. He paid them in cash, in fairly small\namounts (this alone should have suggested to Applicant that the employees were not\nreporting their pay as income to the IRS, and caused him to ask himself why that might\nbe so). He knew the paperwork was onerous, and that filing with the IRS would likely\nmake his employees disappear. Applicant\u2019s claim that he did not know he had to report\ntheir income to the IRS is belied by his conduct well before 2005, and by the\nsophistication and general knowledge he acquired in starting his own companies in\n1998, 2002, and 2002. Finally, Applicant\u2019s claim that he did not know his obligation to\n\n7\nreport his employees income until 2005 is belied by the entry of a single word into the\nAmerican lexicon in January 1993: nannygate\u2014the political and legal fallout attendant\nto hiring domestic employees, whether U.S. citizens or legal or illegal aliens, without\nfiling the required documents with the IRS. The events that spawned this word got\nnational, if not international, coverage, but more important, occurred in the same\ngeographic region where Applicant has lived since then.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct regarding his household workers alone supports denying his\nclearance, but his other misconduct only adds to that result. In decreasing order of\nseverity, his violating state gun law was dangerous (despite his reported precautions)\nand showed his willingness to violate laws when expedient. Similarly, his pocketing\ncompany refunds and using the money for personal expenses was dishonest and\nconverted company finances into personal income for him. Finally, not paying for or\nreturning items he was not charged for may not be illegal, but neither is it particularly\nhonest or ethical. How a person acts when others are unaware of their conduct gives\ninsight into their character. These latter two allegations might deserve to be mitigated as\nminor misconduct, but as they are part of the thread of questionable judgment and\ntrustworthiness demonstrated by the more serious misconduct, I do not find them\nmitigated. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, and the fact that he has not committed any\nmisconduct since 2006, do not ameliorate the security concerns raised by his\nmisconduct over more than 15 years. The mere passage of time is insufficient to\nmitigate this conduct. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nAlthough this case is alleged under Guideline E, it is equally about a whole-\nperson analysis. Despite the recommendation of his employer, the fact that Applicant\nhas not had any other incidents since 2006, and has demonstrated his adherence to\nsecurity protocols, his long history of poor judgment and untrustworthiness augurs\nagainst a whole-person analysis in his favor.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

On August 7, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 25, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F.\nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, which showed that Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness resulted from period of unemployment or underemployment and that Applicant was\ncurrently working with a credit counselor to resolve his financial problems.   In support of his\n1\ncontention, Applicant cites to five hearing-level cases in which applicants in ostensibly similar\ncircumstances were granted clearances.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe Board gives due consideration to the cases cited by Applicant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n06-05903 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  However, the Board has previously noted that decisions\nin other hearing-level cases are not legally binding precedent, even if an applicant can establish close\nfactual similarities between those cases and his case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile his decision in this\ncase with decisions in other ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  \u201cThe adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables\nknown as the whole-person concept.\u201d  Directive at \u00b6 E2.2(a).  \u201cEach case must be judged on its own\nmerits . . .\u201d Id at \u00b6 E2.2(b).\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\n\n\u201cThe SOR alleges  21 delinquent debts totaling about $38,722, including 9 default judgments and two other\n2\nunpaid judgments totaling $24,511.  Applicant admitted all the delinquent debts except the default judgment alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.d and the four default judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e.\u201d  Decision at 2. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant states that at the time of the hearing, his credit counselor \u201chad only been assisting\n3\n[him] for about 60 days\u201d and that \u201c[h]e had not yet presented [him] with a plan because he had not yet contacted all the\ncreditors, he had not received answers from all the creditors that he had contacted, and none of the promised written\nsettlement offers had yet been received form those creditors who had verbally agreed to provide them[.]\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nBrief at 2-3.\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant as to SOR paragraphs 1(d), (e), and (f).  Those favorable findings are\n4\nnot at issue on appeal.\n3\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.   At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\n2\noutstanding debts, and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.   In light of the foregoing,\n3\nthe Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to three of the SOR\nallegations.   However, he reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\n4\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On \nAugust 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 12, 2008; answered it on \nSeptember 3; 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nNovember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreceived the request on September 4, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed \non September 17, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on September 22, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nOctober 21, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and presented the testimony of two witnesses. The record closed on October 21, \n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 30, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant denied the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.d and admitted the remaining allegations. He also suggested that the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.l duplicated \u00b6 1.c and 1.i. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old software systems engineer for a federal contractor. He \nis married and has two children, ages 10 and 8. He graduated from college in June \n1973 with a bachelor of science degree in software engineering. He started a master\u2019s \ndegree program in management science and completed all his course requirements, but \nhe abandoned his graduate studies when he found full-time employment (Tr. 65-65). He \nreceived a security clearance in January 1974 while working for a defense contractor \nand held it for 11 years (Tr. 100), but he does not hold a current clearance. He worked \nin the private sector until September 2001, when he was laid off. At the time, his \neffective income, with stock options and other forms of compensation, was about \n$200,000. He testified most of the debts alleged in the SOR were incurred before he \nwas laid off (Tr. 69). \n \nApplicant was unemployed until August 2002. He moved back to his home state; \nand he, his wife, and his children lived with his mother (Tr. 73). He was employed in \nvarious jobs, including low paying \u201cday labor\u201d jobs and as a telemarketer, from \nSeptember 2002 until January 2003. He began working with a mortgage company in \n2003 and eventually became a senior loan officer, earning about $24,000 per year (Tr. \n80). He began working for his current employer in December 2007, and he now earns \nabout $92,000 a year. His former supervisor at the mortgage company has offered him \nan opportunity to work part-time as a loan officer to generate additional income, and he \nhas accepted the offer, earning an additional $900 per month (Tr. 57; GX 3 at 5). \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at his primary job testified his performance has been \n\u201csuperior.\u201d He testified he \u201ccouldn\u2019t ask for better.\u201d He described Applicant as reliable, \ndependable, intelligent, and a person who responds to challenges aggressively (Tr. 27). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts totaling about $38,772, including 9 default \njudgments and two other unpaid judgments totaling $24,511. Applicant admitted all the \ndelinquent debts except the default judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d and the four default \njudgments alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Department Counsel presented no evidence to support \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOver the years, Applicant contacted his creditors to determine who owned the \ndebt, but he did not negotiate any payment plans. His supervisor at the mortgage \ncompany also is his credit counselor. His credit counselor negotiated with Applicant\u2019s \ncreditors and received settlement offers on several delinquent debts. Although Applicant \nfirst estimated he had about $500 per month available for delinquent debts, the credit \ncounselor determined that Applicant could cut back on expenses and generate about \n$1,000 per month for delinquent debt payments. He advised Applicant to first pay off the \nsmaller creditors and then negotiate payment plans on the larger debts (Tr. 49). As of \nthe date of the hearing, no payments had been made on any of the delinquent debts \n(Tr. 52).  \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nJudgment \n(Time Share) \n$6,383 \nUnpaid \nTr. 41-42 \n1.b \nJudgment \n(Credit card) \n$1,867 \nSettlement offer for $1949 \nTr. 42 \n1.c \nJudgment  \n(Credit card) \n$6,208 \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.d \nJudgment (Rent) \n$780 \nSatisfied \nTr. 43; Answer  \n1.e \nJudgments (Rent) \n$3,530 \nNo evidence \nTr. 13 \n1.f \nJudgment \n(Personal Loan) \n$1,000 \nClaim abandoned \nTr. 43, 91, 104; \nAnswer  \n1.g \nJudgment \n(Medical) \n$979 \nUnpaid \nTr. 44 \n1.h \nJudgment  \n(Credit card) \n$3,764 \nSettlement offer for $2,258\nTr. 44 \n1.i \nCell phone \n$311 \nUnpaid \nTr. 44 \n1.j \nCell phone \n$418 \nUnpaid \nTr. 44 \n1.k \nTelephone \n$250 \nSettlement offer for $125 \nTr. 45 \n1.l \nCredit card \n$6,851 \nSettlement offer for $4,200\nTr. 45 \n1.m \nCredit card \n$817 \nUnpaid \nTr. 45-46 \n1.n \nTelephone \n$219 \nUnpaid \nTr. 46 \n1.o \nMedical bill \n$651 \nUnpaid \nTr. 46 \n1.p \nMedical bill \n$480 \nUnpaid \nTr. 46 \n1.q \nStorage \n$374 \nUnpaid \nTr. 47 \n1.r \nCell phone \n$482 \nSettlement offer for $381 \nTr. 47 \n1.s \nCable \n$170 \nUnpaid \nTr. 47 \n1.t \nCredit card \n$3,073 \nSettlement offer for $615 \nTr. 44-45 \n1.u \nTelephone \n$165 \nSettlement offer for $82 \nTr. 45 \n \n \nApplicant is living modestly. He does not own a home, and he has only one credit \ncard, with a credit limit of $150. He has one car, a seven-year-old minivan (Tr. 124). He \n\n \n4 \n \n \nadmitted at the hearing that his delinquent debts have been \u201coff the radar screen\u201d \nbecause his creditors have not been contacting him. He testified he learned in the \nmortgage business that being proactive toward \u201cessentially dormant\u201d debts can have a \nnegative effect on a credit score. He has been working on improving his credit score \nwith a view toward buying a home (Tr. 127). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n5 \n \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an Ainability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ There is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible \nspending. Applicant was living within his means until he lost his job in September 2001. \nHowever, his record of longstanding delinquent debts raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), \nshifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition. It may be established by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or \nAso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any \nof the three disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished unless the conduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nNeither of the first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cso infrequent\u201d) is established \nbecause Applicant has numerous delinquent debts that are not resolved. The third \nprong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is established because Applicant is employed, highly \nregarded by his supervisor, lives modestly, and has kept up with his current debts. \nNevertheless, his lack of effort to resolve his delinquent debts after being employed for \n10 months, and his failure to execute the plan devised by his credit counselor casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not established.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s loss of \nemployment and subsequent periods of underemployment were circumstances beyond \nhis control. He initially acted responsibly, seeking other employment, accepting \npositions far below his qualifications, and moving in with his mother to save money. His \nlack of effort after he obtained his current position in December 2007, however, was not \nresponsible. I conclude he has not fully established the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant\u2019s credit counselor presented him with a detailed plan to resolve his debts and \nnegotiated settlement offers for many of the debts, but Applicant had taken no action to \nexecute the plan as of the date of the hearing. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not \nestablished.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nApplicant resolved the judgment for unpaid rent (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and the judgment based on \nthe personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f), but he took no action to resolve his remaining delinquent \ndebts. He admitted at the hearing that he allowed the debts to remain dormant in order \nto focus on improving his credit score and qualifying for a home loan. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \nestablished.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nsuggested that two debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.l might be duplicates of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n\n \n7 \n \n \n1.c and 1.i, but he offered no evidence that he had disputed the duplicate debts. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a talented, well-educated, mature adult. He was articulate, sincere, \ncandid, and credible at the hearing. He held a clearance for 11 years without incident. \nHe has worked hard to avoid additional delinquent debts, and he has a modest lifestyle. \nHe has taken a step in the right direction by obtaining the services of his former \nsupervisor as a credit counselor, but he has failed to carry out the financial plan he was \ngiven, even though he now has the means to begin paying off his debts. Until he \nestablishes a track record of systematically resolving his delinquent debts, he will \nremain vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.37 through E3.1.41 (reconsideration authorized after one year).  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.u: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 17, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the administrative record.  On May 6, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.\n \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s current total delinquent debt is approximately $120,000.\nThe Judge also found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding two of the SOR allegations.  The Judge\nacknowledged that some of Applicant\u2019s circumstances were beyond his control in creating the\ndelinquencies, but she explained why this fact did not overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge\u2019s factual findings are supported by the evidence.  \n  \nApplicant argues that his situation should have caused the Judge to apply the Guideline F\nmitigating conditions in his favor.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She concluded that, notwithstanding the partial applicability of two\nGuideline F Mitigating Conditions, the evidence in mitigation was of insufficient strength to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Specifically, the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor\non two of the debts alleged in the SOR based on Applicant\u2019s explanations.  The Judge ultimately\nconcluded, however, that because of the substantial amount of delinquent debt remaining, Applicant\nhad not established sufficient mitigation to satisfy his burden of overcoming the government\u2019s case.\nThis conclusion is reasonably supported by the record.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\n\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions, \nStandard Form 86 (SF-86), on November 28, 2007. On October 17, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMay 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nIn his undated Answer to the SOR, Applicant requested a decision on the record \nin lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on \nFebruary 26, 2009. The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 7.  \nBy letter dated March 2, 2009, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, with \ninstructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of \nreceipt.  Applicant received the file on March 13, 2009. His response was due on April \n12, 2009. He filed additional information within the required time period. Department \nCounsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s additional information. On April \n22, 2009, the case was assigned to me for a decision.

The allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. and 1.g. are concluded for Applicant.   (Item 1; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old, never married, and employed as a costing and \nscheduling planner by a government contractor. In 1983, he earned a Bachelor of \nScience degree in Business Administration. He has held a security clearance with his \ncurrent employer since 1997. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reported a net monthly income of \n$4,794. He identified $930 in fixed living expenses, and he reported a monthly home \nmortgage payment of $1,856. He reported he was current on his home mortgage as \nwell as five consumer debts, totaling $11,625, on which he made total monthly \npayments of $336.  Applicant reported a monthly net reminder of $1,671. (Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s assets include approximately $208,000 in real estate investments, \n$6,700 in bank savings, $48,000 in a 410 K pension plan, and two automobiles valued \nat $24,000.  (Item 6.) \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted five delinquent debts of \napproximately $120,200. He stated that all five delinquent debts had resulted from \nlosses associated with two real estate investments. He explained that the delinquent \ndebt of approximately $14,947, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b, arose when he renovated his two \nproperties after a hurricane. He stated that he intended to settle the account by using \nfunds acquired from refinancing his primary residence, his income tax refund, and his \n401 K account. (Item 4; Response to FORM.) \n \n \nApplicant identified the delinquent debt of $5,250, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c, as owed \nto a furniture company.  He stated that he had been unable to pay the debt because of \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis struggle to pay other delinquencies associated with his real estate properties. He \nstated that he intended to pay this debt in full from funds he hoped to acquire from \nrefinancing his primary residence, his income tax refund, and his 401 K account.  (Item \n4.) \n \n \nApplicant stated that a delinquent debt of $10,872, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d, had \nresulted when he was unable to pay for renovations he had made to his two rental \nproperties after they were damaged by a hurricane.  He stated he also plans to pay this \ndebt from proceeds received from refinancing his primary residence, his tax refund, and \nhis 401 K account. \n \n \nApplicant identified the delinquent debts of $46,185 and $42,954, alleged at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.f., as  home equity/home mortgage accounts financing the purchases of \ntwo condominiums that had been foreclosed as a result of past due payments. He \nstated he had been unable to rent or sell the properties because of a downturn in the \nhousing market in his region in 2006 and 2007. He stated that after the properties were \nsold at auction, he would be responsible for paying income tax on any outstanding \namount owed. Applicant\u2019s credit report indicates that he defaulted on the mortgages in \nthe fall of 2007. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 7.) \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that he had financial and legal \nadvice regarding the foreclosure of his two condominium apartments. It not clear from \nthe record that he has had consumer credit counseling.  (Item 4.) \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant emphasized that his financial difficulties \nwere temporary and should not be seen as indications of irresponsibility and lack of \nsecurity worthiness.   He stated: \u201cThat some bad business decisions, bad timing, and a \nreal estate market crash led to my current financial condition, is absolutely no reason to \nquestion my character as a trusted, responsible protector of my Country\u2019s secrets.\u201d \n(Response to FORM at 1.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n4 \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and did not pay \nhis creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least 2007. \nMoreover, the delinquencies remain unpaid and have occurred under circumstances \nthat are likely to recur.  \n \nApplicant has income and financial resources sufficient to pay or settle several of \nhis delinquent debts, and he has failed to do so. Certainly, the downturn in the housing \nmarket and damage to his properties by a hurricane were beyond Applicant\u2019s control.  \nHowever, the record does not reflect that Applicant\u2019s actions in the face of his financial \ndifficulties were reasonable and responsible. Applicant expressed his intent to satisfy \nand settle his delinquent debts in the future. However, in determining an individual's \nsecurity worthiness, the Government cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant \nmight resolve his or her outstanding debts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) apply in part to the \nfacts of Applicant\u2019s case.  However, I also conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not \napply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. He \nearns a good salary and reports a net remainder each month of $1,671. Not counting \nhis real property, he has over $75,000 in personal assets. Despite these financial \nstrengths, Applicant has failed to satisfy or to show good faith attempts to satisfy his \ndelinquent debts. His failure to initiate actions to satisfy some of his smaller debts even \nwhen he had sufficient funds to do so raises security concerns about his judgment and \nreliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b. through 1.f.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On October 3, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant \ndetailing security concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F.  The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nJuly 28, 2008. \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 28, 2008.  She admitted four \nand denied one of the allegations under Guideline F.  Her denial was based only on the \namount of the debt and not the debt itself (Transcript 22-23).  She requested a hearing \n \n1 Applicant recently married and her married last name is now Wright.  However since the Statement of Reasons \nlists her last name as Harris, that name will be used in this decision. \nFebruary 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nbefore an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nNovember 14, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on November 19, 2008.  DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on January 13, 2009, for a hearing on February 3, 2009.  I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered three exhibits, marked \ngovernment exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 3, which were received without objection.  \nApplicant submitted 22 documents, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A-V, which \nwere received without objection.  Applicant also testified.  DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on February 11, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nThe Notice of Hearing was mailed to Applicant on January 13, 2009.  Applicant \nsigned for the Notice of Hearing on January 26, 2009.  She spoke to Department \nCounsel about a date for the hearing prior to January 13, 2009.  Applicant is entitled to \n15 days notice of a hearing (Directive E3.1.8).  Even though Applicant discussed a \nhearing date with Department Counsel at least 15 days prior to the hearing, Applicant \nwas asked if she had sufficient notice and time to prepare for the hearing.  She stated \nshe was prepared and waived the 15 day notice requirement (Tr. 7).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and is an administrative assistant for a defense \ncontractor providing support to a Reserve officer Training Corps (ROTC) unit at a \nuniversity.  Applicant served over twenty years on active duty with the Army retiring in \n2005 as a sergeant first class (E-7). She served in mainly administrative positions \naround the world.  She held a security clearance while on active duty.  She received \nnumerous awards to include the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement \nMedal (App. Ex. H, Certificate, dated August 26, 1986), and the Meritorious Service \nMedal (App. Ex. I, Certificate, dated February 28, 2005).  At the time of her retirement, \nshe was assigned to the ROTC unit at the university.  She took a civilian position at the \nsame unit upon her retirement.  She was married but divorced while on active duty and \nhas one child from that marriage.  She has remarried and also has two step-children \n(Tr. 14-22; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated March 12, 2008; App. Ex. F, DD 214, dated April \n30, 2005; App. Ex. G, Enlisted Record Brief, dated January 10, 2005). \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 2, Credit Report, dated December 21, 2007; See also, \nGov. Ex. 3, Answers to Interrogatory, Credit Report, dated August 15, 2008, 113-141) \nshow that Applicant had the following five delinquent debts from credit cards and other \nstore charges; a charged off credit card account with a bank for $13, 701 (SOR 1.a); \nanother credit card account with the same bank placed for collection for $11,803 (SOR \n1.b); a collection account for furniture with a financial company for $4,995 (SOR 1.c); a \ncredit card account charged-off for $2,049 (SOR 1.d); and a judgment on a personal \nloan for $5,835 (SOR 1.e).   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nWhen Applicant left active duty and started to work for the defense contractor, \nshe experienced financial difficulties.  Here net pay was reduced by about $600 per \nmonth even though she was drawing a salary and retired pay.  Her military pay had \nbeen about $38,000 a year, but now her combined pay was approximately $32,000 a \nyear.  She purchased a home, was now paying a mortgage, purchased furniture for the \nhouse, and had to buy a used car since her old car ceased to run.  She was a single \nparent with child care expenses.  Also at the request of her family, her nephew came to \nlive with her and she had to provide for his support until he found a job.  She worked a \npart time job as a cashier at a home improvement store to gain extra funds.  She was \nable to make the minimum payments on her debts until about late 2006 to early 2007 \n(Tr. 23-26, 30-34).  She now has no credit cards.  Her present net pay from retirement \nand salary has risen and is now approximately $3,700, with monthly expenses of \napproximately $3,500 which includes payments to a debt consolidation company.  She \nhas discretionary funds of approximately $200 each month (Tr. 42-43, 47-49, 58-62).   \n \nPrior to receipt of the SOR, Applicant tried to work with two debt consolidation \ncompanies in 2007 to assist her in paying her delinquent debts.  However, both \ncompanies charged large fees, and Applicant was not seeing her payments to them \nreducing her debts (Tr. 39-42).  She also tried to get a loan to consolidate her debts \nfrom her credit union, but was rejected (Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, Letter, \ndated August 5, 2008, at 110).  She also worked part time for some months to earn \nextra income.  Applicant is now working with a different credit counseling and debt \npayment assistance company and pays them $451.49 per month.  They are assisting \nher in negotiating settlements and resolving her debts.  The five debts listed on the SOR \nare included on this debt consolidation payment plan.  The company thinks her debts \ncan be resolved in three to five years (Tr. 55-57; App. Ex. S, Letter, dated October 10, \n2008; App. Ex. T, Monthly Statement, dated January 5, 2009; App. Ex. V, Monthly \nStatement, dated November 3, 2008; App. Ex. V, Bank funds transfer, dated January \n20, 2009). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.a, is a charged off credit card account with a bank.  The \noriginal debt was for $6,000 but with fees and interests added as the account was sold.  \nIt is now listed at $13,701.  The bank sent the debt to a law firm for collection and \nApplicant made at least four or five payments of $180 as part of an old payment plan \n(Tr. 36-37, 45-48; App. Ex J, Check, dated June 30, 2008; App. Ex. K, Letter, dated \nMarch 27, 2008; See also, Gov. Ex. 2, Answer to Interrogatories, Check, dated May 19, \n2008, at 111-112).  The debt is now being paid as part of her debt consolidation \npayment plan.   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.b is for a second credit card account with the same bank \nin collection for $11,083.  The original amount of the debt was $6,000 and the present \namount is for fees and interest, as the account has been sold to different collection \ncompanies.  Applicant made payments on the account and the debt is listed with the \ncollection agency at $7,873.60.  The account is now in collection by another collection \nagency but is still listed for $11,083 by her debt consolidation company (Tr. 46-54; App. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nEx. N, letter, dated October 9, 2006; App. Ex. O, letter, date January 8, 2007; App. Ex. \nP, Letter, dated October 25, 2006; app. Ex. Q, Letter, dated August 8, 2006; App. Ex. R, \nletter, dated February 8, 2006).  This debt is included in her payment plan with the debt \nconsolidation company (App. Ex. S, Letter, dated October 10, 2008).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.c is a furniture account in collection for $4,995.  Applicant \npurchased dining and living room furniture for her new house for approximately $1,800.  \nShe made some payments on the account.  It has been sold to various collection \nagencies bringing the new debt to the $4,995 amount.  This debt is also included in the \ndebt consolidation payment plan (Tr. 53-53). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.d is for a computer Applicant's purchased for her nephew \nthat has been charged off for $2,049.  Applicant purchased the computer for \napproximately $1,400 to $1,500 and made payments on this account of $45 monthly for \nabout three years until some time in 2007.  She believes the debt had been down to \nless than $1,000.  The debt has been sold to collection agencies and is now at the \n$2,049 amount.  It is part of her debt consolidation payment plan (Tr. 55-56).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.e is a judgment on the purchase of bedroom furniture for \nher home in the amount of $5,835.  The actual purchase price of the furniture was \napproximately $3,000.  She paid from $90 to $100 monthly on the debt for about two \nyears until late 2006 or early 2007.  The amount of the debt was less than $2,000.  It is \nalso part of her debt consolidation payment plan (Tr. 56-57).   \n \n \nApplicant's supervisor for the last 19 months, an Army lieutenant colonel, \nnotes that she is an outstanding worker who ensures mission success.  She is caring, \nwilling, and loyal to the organization.  She is responsible for her actions and trustworthy.  \nIt is his opinion she would not compromise her integrity.  Her character and integrity are \nbeyond reproach (App. Ex. A, Letter, dated January 27, 2009).  Applicant's regimental \nexecutive officer, an Army major, noted that Applicant's performance is outstanding and \nshe is an asset to the organization.  Her efforts directly contributed to the organization's \nsuccess (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated July 28, 2008).  Applicant's performance evaluations \nsince her employment by the defense contractor have been rated at the highest rating, \noutstanding.  She is a great performer and a valued employee (App. Ex. C, Evaluation, \ndated December 20, 2007; App. Ex. D, Evaluation, dated October 26, 2005).  Applicant \nalso received a certificate for outstanding service in 2007 (App. Ex. E, Certificate, dated \nApril 5, 2007).   \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts that Applicant admits and are listed on credit reports \nare a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\"   \n \n \nApplicant raised mitigating circumstances for her debts by her testimony.  I \nconsidered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\" and determine it has some \napplication.  Applicant frequently encountered delinquent debts since there are debts \nfrom a number of credit cards.  The delinquent debts arose when Applicant retired from \nthe military entered the civilian work force and received less cash each month.  In \naddition, she was a single mother who purchased a house when she retired, had to \nfurnish it, and take financial responsibility for a nephew.  While Applicant still has \ndelinquent debts that have not been resolved, they occurred under the circumstances of \nher change from military to civilian life, and the problems she encountered with family.  \nThese are unusual circumstances and not likely to recur.  Applicant is now solidly \nemployed in the civilian workforce and her debts are under control.  Her financial \nproblems should not recur.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\" also has some application.  Applicant \nencountered financial problems when first entering the civilian workforce.  She paid her \ndebts as best she could until the financial situation overcame her efforts.  She took \npositive steps to resolve those issues.  She tried to work with two credit counseling \nservices, but found they were not taking positive steps for her but incurring \nadministrative costs.  She worked a part time job to earn extra money.  She finally found \na credit counseling firm to help her, and she is making payments to the firm and they \nare helping to reduce her debts.  The original debt is not as large as listed in the SOR \nsince most of the listed debt is for fees and interests as the debts were sold to collection \nagencies.  She acted responsibly under the circumstances to control and manage her \ndebts. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under \ncontrol\" applies.  Applicant has repeatedly tried credit counseling to assist her.  Her first \nefforts were not successful since the firms did not help her reduce her debts.  She now \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhas a credit counseling firm that is working with her to reduce her debts.  Her financial \nproblems are being resolved and are under control.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  Applicant paid her debts as best she could \nuntil her financial problems overwhelmed her efforts.  She now has a payment plan with \na credit counseling agency and is paying under that plan on all six of her debts.  \nApplicant has not incurred additional delinquent debts since she started her efforts to \npay the delinquent debts.  Applicant acted responsibly towards her debts, and \nestablished a good-faith effort to resolve her debts.  She mitigated security concerns for \nher financial situation \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's 20 years of \nactive duty in the Army and her honorable discharge.  I considered that she has \nsuccessfully held a security clearance while on active duty.  I considered the views of \nher military superiors as to her reliability and trustworthiness.  I considered her \nperformance and that the fact she is regarded as a good employee who can be trusted.  \nApplicant encountered financial problems when she left active duty and entered the \ncivilian work force.  She was a single mother with a new home, a nephew she was \nresponsible for, and less funds each month.  She tried to keep up with her finances but \nshe could not.  Before she received the SOR, she was making efforts to pay her \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndelinquent debts, checking with credit counseling firms and working a second job.  She \nhas a payment plan in place with a credit counseling agency and is paying on the plan.  \nApplicant lives within her means and meets her personal financial obligations.  Her \nactions do not indicate poor self control, lack of judgment or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn January 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required in connection\nwith his research work for a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the\nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant two sets of interrogatories  to obtain clarification of\n1\nand/or additional information about potentially disqualifying information in his\nbackground. After reviewing the results of the background investigation, including his\nresponses to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary\nMay 29, 2009\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant\n2\naccess to classified information. On November 14, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline\n3\nC (foreign preference).\nOn December 1, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitted without\nexplanation all of the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. On January 14, 2009,\nDepartment Counsel made a pre-hearing submission through which the government\nasked that administrative notice be taken of certain facts germane to the issues\npresented by the pleadings. The submission consisted of a five page memorandum to\nwhich 15 documents (I - XV) were attached.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 23, 2009, and I convened a hearing\non March 31, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on April 10, 2009. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented three exhibits \u2013 Applicant\u2019s\ne-QIP (Gx. 1) and his responses to interrogatories (Gx. 2 and 3). They were admitted\nwithout objection. I also granted the government\u2019s pre-hearing administrative notice\nrequest. The entire administrative notice request is included in the record as Judicial\nExhibit (Jx. 1); however, for reasons discussed at the hearing (Tr. 24 - 27), I have not\nconsidered the information contained in Jx. 1, Attachments XII - XIV.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline C, the government alleged that Applicant exercises dual\ncitizenship between the U.S. and Israel (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that, as of August 2008, he\npossessed an active Israeli passport (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that, despite the fact he is a native-\nborn U.S. citizen, in 2005, he renewed his Israeli passport for 10 years (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that\nhe used his Israeli passport instead of his U.S. passport for travel to Israel (SOR \u00b6 1.d);\nthat he used his Israeli passport instead of his U.S. passport for travel to India in 2008\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); that he voted in elections in Israel three times (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he served\nin the Israeli army in 1984 and 1985 as required of all Israeli citizens (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and,\nas also alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.h, that he and his wife have owned a condominium in Israel\nsince 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.h).\nUnder Guideline B, the government alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a\ncitizen of and resides in Israel (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that Applicant traveled to Israel at least four\ntimes between 2000 and 2008 (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that his travel to Israel from 2000 to 2007\nwas for scientific collaborations and to give lectures (SOR \u00b6 2.c); that he was a\nprofessor at an Israeli institute from 1989 until 1991 (SOR \u00b6 2.d); that he was an\nassociate professor at an Israeli university in 1984 and 1985 (SOR \u00b6 2.e); that he was a\n\n3\nlecturer at an Israeli institute from 1980 to 1982 (SOR \u00b6 2.f) and from 1976 to 1978\n(SOR \u00b6 2.g); and that he and his wife jointly own a condominium in Israel (SOR \u00b6 2.h).\nAs noted above, Applicant admitted without explanation each of these allegations. I\nhave also made the following findings of relevant fact\nApplicant is 58 years old and is a tenured professor of electrical and computer\nengineering at a major U.S. university. In 1976, he received his doctorate in\nmathematics from a prestigious U.S. university and has taught in universities in the U.S.\nsince 1986. (Gx. 1) Applicant also has an extensive record of research consulting work\nfor companies working on defense-related projects. His request for a security clearance\nis for his mathematical analysis and research work for a company sub-contracted to a\nlarge defense contractor. (Tr. 29 - 33)\nApplicant was born and raised in the United States. His mother, was born and\nraised in Palestine before the 1948 creation of the state of Israel. She and Applicant\u2019s\nfather came to the United States in about 1950. In about 1972, they divorced and she\nreturned to Israel, where she lived until she died. Applicant\u2019s father is also deceased.\nApplicant moved to Israel after finishing his graduate education in 1976. By virtue of his\nmother\u2019s Israeli citizenship, Applicant is also an Israeli citizen. He first received an\nIsraeli passport for travel with his parents when he was about six years old. As an adult,\nhe has held and maintained an Israeli passport for at least 30 years. His current Israeli\npassport is valid until 2015. Applicant has traveled often to Israel, most recently in\nMarch 2009. He traveled there at least five times in 2008. All of Applicant\u2019s travel to\nIsrael and to other countries has been pursuant to his work as an academician and\nlecturer in mathematics and engineering, and has been paid for by the universities for\nwhom he has worked. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr. 57)\nBy Israeli law, Applicant must use an Israeli passport to enter and leave that\ncountry. (Jx. 1, Attachment II) For all other travel, and to leave and enter the United\nStates, he uses his U.S. passport.  On one occasion, when traveling from Israel to India\nfor a personal matter, he needed a visa from the Indian consulate in Tel Aviv. He\npresented his U.S. passport, but Indian consular officials asked for his Israeli passport,\nin which they stamped their visa. (Gx. 2; Tr. 37) Applicant intends to retain his passport,\nboth for reasons of emotional ties to Israel and to comply with Israeli law when entering\nor leaving that country. He is likewise unwilling to renounce his Israeli citizenship. (Gx.\n2; Tr. 43)\nApplicant and his wife were married in Israel in June 1977. They raised two\nchildren, now ages 32 and 27. Their children were born in Israel, but raised and\neducated in the United States. Their children have lived in Israel as post-graduate\nstudents, hold Israeli citizenship and Israeli passports, and, in the case of Applicant\u2019s\nson, served in the Israeli army as required of all Israeli citizens. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr.\n59 - 61)\nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Romania, but raised in Israel. She became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in September 2007. Her 88-year-old mother, a retired chemist,\nstill lives in Jerusalem. Applicant has incidental telephone contact with her every week,\nand his wife speaks to her daily. His wife travels to Israel three times each year to visit,\n\n4\nand his mother-in-law visits them in the U.S. for several weeks each year. She is\napplying for permanent resident alien status in the U.S.. Applicant has no contact with\nhis wife\u2019s extended family overseas. Applicant also has extended family on his mother\u2019s\nside still in Israel, but he has no contact with any of them. Aside from compulsory\nmilitary service, none of Applicant\u2019s own family or his wife\u2019s family has ever been\nemployed by or is an official of the Israeli government. (Tr. 50 - 55)\nApplicant voted in Israeli elections in 1992, 1999 and 2004. He did not travel to\nIsrael so he could vote, but voted because he happened to be in Israel on those\noccasions. Applicant intends to vote in future Israeli elections if the opportunity again\npresents itself. (Tr. 43 - 45, 58) \nIn August 1984, Applicant returned to Israel with his wife and children, in part,\nbecause her father had suffered a heart attack. Applicant also took a teaching position\nat an Israeli university. However, when he entered the country, officials noted he had\nnot fulfilled the military service required of all Israeli citizens. In October 1984, he was\ndrafted into the army and served until being released from military service in February\n1985. He then apparently resumed his teaching until August 1985. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 45\n- 49)\nIn addition to his academic positions in the U.S., Applicant has taught and\nlectured for extended periods at universities and scientific institutes in Israel. From\nAugust 1976 through July 1978, and again from September 1980 until August 1982,\nApplicant was first a lecturer, then a senior lecturer in mathematics at a science\nresearch institute near Tel Aviv. From August 1984 until August 1985, as discussed\nabove, he was an associate professor of mathematics at an Israeli university. In\nOctober 1989, he took a two-year leave of absence from his professorship in electrical\nand computer engineering at a large state university in the U.S. to teach electrical\nengineering at a technological institute in Israel. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant and his wife jointly own a condominium in Jerusalem. She bought it in\n2000 for her mother to use; however, Applicant believes one of her cousins is using it\nnow. Applicant has never seen the property and believes the purchase price was about\nthe equivalent of $200,000. All of the financing for the property was done in the United\nStates through U.S. banks. All payments and related matters are handled solely in the\nU.S.. Applicant has no financial interests in Israel save for the vestiges of payroll and\nretirement accounts from his employment at the universities and institutions discussed\nabove. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 34 - 35, 48 - 50)\nIsrael has an advanced, industrial market economy, and its government is\ncharacterized as a multi-party parliamentary democracy. (Jx. 1, Attachment III) Since its\nfounding in 1948, Israel and the United States have had close political, economic, and\nmilitary ties based, in large measure, on common democratic values and mutual\nsecurity interests in the Middle East. Israel has an independent judiciary and the\ngovernment\u2019s human rights record is generally free of reports of widespread abuse by\ngovernment officials. What human rights concerns there are stem predominantly from\nreports of discrimination and arbitrary detention in the course of Israeli counter-terrorism\nefforts. Israel is also one of the most active countries engaged in military and industrial\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n5\nespionage. Their efforts have been directed at hostile and friendly countries alike,\nincluding the United States. Overall, however, their interests are generally aligned with\nours, especially where matters of regional security are concerned.  (Jx. 1, Attachments I\n- III, VI, VII)\nApplicant was, at all times during the investigation and adjudication process,\ncandid and forthcoming about his ties to Israel and about all information relevant to his\napplication for a security clearance. He avers that he is a loyal U.S. citizen who does\nnot place the interests of Israel or any other country ahead of the United States. His\nparents immigrated to the United States with little in their possession and made a good\nlife for their family. Applicant grew up in modest circumstances and is grateful for the\nopportunities he has been given, especially his education. (Tr. 39) While his career has\ngenerally been in the world of university academics, Applicant also has been directly\ninvolved in a number of defense industry research and development efforts, albeit on an\nunclassified basis. (Tr. 63 - 67) He insists he would not do anything to undermine the\nU.S. national interests because he is a loyal, trustworthy American and because he\nunderstands that Israel\u2019s existence and national security are dependent on the United\nStates. (Tr. 37 - 40)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 6, Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and AG \u00b6 9, Guideline C (Foreign Preference).\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n AG \u00b6 11(a) provides for mitigation where an applicant\u2019s \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents'\n8\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d\n6\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the facts alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1. Those allegations, which Applicant admits, raise security concerns about\nwhether Applicant may place the interests of another country ahead of those of the\nUnited States. Specifically, the security concern stated in AG \u00b6 9 (Guideline C: Foreign\nPreference) is that, \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nThe facts established show that Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen, who also has\nIsraeli citizenship through his mother. By itself, such status is not disqualifying.8\nHowever, since 1976 Applicant has actively exercised his Israeli citizenship through his\npossession and use of an active Israeli passport, at times instead of his U.S. passport.\nApplicant also served in the Israeli military and voted in three Israeli elections. These\nfacts require application of the disqualifying conditions listed under AG \u00b6 10(a) (exercise\nof any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport; (2) military service or a willingness to bear\narms for a foreign country; and... (7) voting in a foreign election).\n\n W hile the government does not require renunciation of one\u2019s foreign citizenship, an expressed willingness\n9\nto do so would inure to his benefit through application of AG \u00b6 11(b). \n7\nThe government\u2019s information also established that Applicant and his wife jointly\nown real estate in Israel possibly valued at about $200,000. This fact may be a financial\ninterest in Israel; however, for that fact to be disqualifying under Guideline C, it must\nalso be shown that Applicant is using his foreign citizenship to protect that interest. (AG\n\u00b6 10(a)(5)) Such is not the case here.\nBy contrast, the record does not support any of the mitigating factors under AG \u00b6\n11. Applicant derived his Israeli citizenship from his mother. However, he has actively\nexercised his foreign citizenship since at least 1976. Further, he has not expressed a\nwillingness to renounce his foreign citizenship.  Because he was born a U.S. citizen, AG\n9\n\u00b6 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred\nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor) is not\napplicable. His possession and use of an active foreign passport, which Applicant will\nnot surrender and which he intends to renew in 2015, has not been sanctioned by any\ncognizant security authority. Finally, there is no information that shows that the U.S.\ngovernment encouraged Applicant to vote in Israeli elections on three occasions when\nhe happened to be in the country on election day.\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant avers he has no\npreference for Israeli interests over the U.S. As to his use of an Israeli passport, he is\nunwilling to relinquish it because he is required to use it when he travels to Israel. His\nposition is, in part, that Israeli law left him no choice in the matter of his passport or his\nmilitary service. As to the latter, Applicant had lived in Israel for several years beginning\nin 1976, and it is reasonable to assume he knew or should have known what Israeli law\nrequired in this regard. Accordingly, I conclude he knowingly made himself available to\nthis and all other requirements of Israeli law. \nApplicant also acknowledged that he maintains his passport and, by inference,\nhis Israeli citizenship for emotional reasons, as well. All of the information bearing on\nthis issue shows that Applicant has willingly subjected himself to Israeli laws and other\nrequirements of Israeli citizenship. Despite his sincere expressions of preference for\nU.S. interests, Applicant\u2019s actions in furtherance of his Israeli citizenship raise legitimate\nsecurity concerns expressed through Guideline C about his ability to protect U.S.\ninterests in preference to all others. The information Applicant presented in response to\nthe government\u2019s case was not sufficient to mitigate these concerns.\nForeign Influence. \nThe government also presented sufficient information to support the factual\nallegations in SOR \u00b6 2. Those allegations, which Applicant admits, raise security\nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s personal relationships and other interests in Israel.\nSpecifically, as stated in AG \u00b6 6, \n\n8\n[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAt the outset, the government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s joint ownership of a\ncondominium in Israel is not disqualifying. Apart from his admission that he has an\ninterest in the property, it appears it is used by either his mother-in-law or a relative with\nwhom he has no contact. The purchase financing was conducted in the U.S., and the\ngovernment has presented nothing to show how, if at all, it constitutes \u201ca substantial\nbusiness, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or\nforeign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of\nforeign influence or exploitation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 7(e); emphasis added) \nAs to his other foreign interests, although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s\nwife, children, and mother-in-law are all Israeli citizens. His wife was only recently\nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen, and their children are native-born Israeli citizens who\nderive U.S. citizenship from Applicant. His elderly mother-in-law resides in Israel full\ntime, and his wife and children reside in the U.S.. However, like Applicant, they spend\nconsiderable time in Israel each year for professional and personal reasons. His wife\nhas weekly, if not daily contact with her mother, who visits the U.S. for several weeks\neach year. Applicant\u2019s wife travels to Israel for extended visits annually as well. These\nfacts require consideration of the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion). \nThere is no question that Applicant has close ties to foreign citizens through his\nfamily. However, for AG \u00b6 7(a) to apply, it must be determined whether their presence in\nIsrael \u201ccreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion.\u201d Israel is an open democratic society with a good human rights\nrecord and close ties to the U.S. based on generally similar political, military and cultural\ninterests. However, in pursuit of its own interests, Israel is also known to aggressively\nengage in industrial and economic espionage targeted against, inter alia, the U.S. Thus,\nit must be acknowledged, especially in light of Applicant\u2019s previous work with U.S.\ndefense projects, that such a heightened risk exists.  AG \u00b6 7(a) applies.\nAs to potential application of the Guideline B mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 8,\ndespite Applicant\u2019s assertions to the contrary, his relationship with his mother-in-law is\npresumed to be close by virtue of his close relationship with his wife. Further, although\nnot specifically alleged in the SOR, the fact that his wife and children, to whom he is\neven more closely bound, also are Israeli citizens and spend significant time in Israel\n\n9\nprecludes application of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign  individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.). For\nthe same reasons, AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation) does not apply.\nApplication of AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest) is likewise precluded because Applicant clearly has\nemotional ties to Israel and has divided his interests between Israel and the U.S.\nthroughout most of his adult life. \nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7, specifically excludes the use of a\ndetermination about an applicant\u2019s loyalty (or disloyalty) to the U.S. as a basis for\ndetermining one\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. However, the language\nof AG \u00b6 8(b) specifically requires a comparison of an applicant\u2019s \u201csense of loyalty or\nobligation\u201d to foreign interests with his \u201crelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Here, the\nApplicant was sincere when he expressed his loyalty and commitment to the United\nStates as a native-born citizen, who is grateful for the opportunities he has received,\nand claimed that he would do nothing to undermine the national interest in the event of\na potential conflict. As a native born U.S. citizen whose livelihood and assets are in the\nU.S., Applicant has longstanding loyalties and relationships here. However, his\nstatements about his loyalty to the U.S. are also probative of the applicability of AG \u00b6\n8(b), because they are couched in his awareness that protection of U.S. interests is,\namong other things, necessary for the continued viability Israel. Thus, it is still unclear\nwhether Applicant can be expected to resolve in favor of the U.S. any conflict of\ninterests arising from his foreign ties and relationships.\nThe mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(d)(the foreign contacts and activities are on\nU.S. Government business or are approved by the cognizant security authority) and\n8(e) (the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding\nthe reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations\nfrom a foreign country) are inapposite to the facts of this case. The applicability of AG \u00b6\n8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is\nsuch that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to\ninfluence, manipulate, or pressure the individual) is rendered moot by the lack of\ninformation that would establish Applicant\u2019s property interest in Israel bears any security\nsignificance under this guideline.\nIn summary, however, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s personal and professional\ncontacts in Israel raise reasonable security concerns. The government\u2019s information\nalso showed that Applicant travels to Israel several times each year for professional\npurposes, and that from 1976 until 1991, he lived and worked in Israel off and on for\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n10\n See footnote 7, supra. \n11\n10\nseven years. As allegations of fact, his travel and work in Israel are not, under this\nguideline, disqualifying in and of themselves. They merely plead evidence of facts\nrelevant and material to an informed decision about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information. Accordingly, I conclude, having considered all of the available\ninformation bearing on the issue of possible foreign preference, that Applicant has failed\nto mitigate this security concern.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines B and C. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a mature,\nresponsible, and highly accomplished 58-year-old academician who has an extensive\nhistory of valuable consulting work with defense contractors. Further, he has been a\nmodel of stability, as he and his wife, who holds a doctorate in chemical engineering,\nhave been married for more than 30 years and have raised two children, who are\nprofessionally and academically accomplished in their own right. For much of his adult\nlife his personal interests have been divided between Israel and the U.S. Certainly,\nthere has been no misconduct here and there is nothing inappropriate or illegal about\nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship status and his interests overseas. However, in the context of\ndeciding whether to allow him access to classified information, the totality of Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances place on him the heavy burden of demonstrating that he would not be\nvulnerable to coercion by a foreign government or that he would be compromised by\nconflicting interests. Insofar as it is unlikely that Applicant\u2019s circumstances will change in\nthe foreseeable future, a fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n10\ninformation shows Applicant has not overcome the doubts about his suitability under\nthese circumstances. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor Applicant to have access to classified information.

On January 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B and Guideline C. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 17, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 23, 2009, and waived his right \nto a hearing before an administrative judge.

He obtained a U.S. passport in \nOctober 2003. (Items 5, 6 at 4, 29) \n \n \nAfter arriving in the United States, Applicant worked at various jobs and owned a \nstore from January 1995 to January 2001. He was unemployed from October 2001 until \nOctober 2002 when he found a job with a private company. (Item 5) In December 2003, \nApplicant began working as a U.S. Army Linguist in Iraq. In August 2005, he suffered a \nheart attack and was sent from Iraq to a military hospital in Germany. Subsequently, he \nwent to Turkey where he recuperated from September 2005 to April 2006 and stayed \nwith his retired cousin. (Item 6 at 31) In April, he returned to the United States and in \nJune 2006 he resumed his position as an Iraqi linguist. (Item 5 at 11; Item 6 at 35) As a \nlinguist, he assists in gathering and translating intelligence. He held an Interim \nclearance until recently and believes he worked with Top Secret information. (Item 6 at \n32)  He would tell his supervisors if he were threatened or approached by a foreign \nnational seeking sensitive or classified information. (Item 6 at 31) He speaks Turkish, \nArabic, including Iraqi, Lebanese and Egyptian dialects.  \n \n \nApplicant possesses a Turkish identification card, initially issued at his birth in \nOctober 1955. He renewed the card in 1991 and 2005. That card gives him rights and \nprivileges of Turkish citizenship, including the right to own property. In 2005, Applicant \npurchased real estate in Turkey for $90,000 (US) with funds he earned through his \nemployment. He spent about $110,000 (US) renovating the property and intends to use \nit as a family vacation home after he retires in the U.S. (Item 6 at 32) Until the recent \nglobal economic downturn and devalued dollar, the property was worth about $280,000 \n(US); it is now worth about $180,000 (US). (Answer) He has approximately $4,000 (US) \nin a Turkish bank account that is left over from the renovation. (Answer) Applicant \nasserted that he informed his employer of the property purchase in March 2006. \n(Answer)  \n \n \nDuring a March 2008 interview, Applicant could not estimate what portion of his \ntotal net worth the real estate in Turkey represented, or imagine under what \ncircumstances he would abandon the house; however, he could sell the property if \nnecessary, as it does not affect his loyalty to the United States. (Item 6 at 32)  \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant completed a Set of Interrogatories. Question No. \n21, which inquires into one\u2019s net worth, is listed twice in the Interrogatories. In both \ninstances, Applicant listed his total net worth as approximately $430,000 (US). (Item 6 \nat 14; 23) In response to Questions No. 15 and 31, which ask the value of his property \nin a foreign country and Turkey (respectively), he listed the value as $280,000. (Item 6 \nat 10, 26) In response to Question No. 16(c), \u201cvalue (in U.S. dollars) of your foreign \nfinancial interest or income,\u201d he wrote $430,000 (US). (Item 6 at 23) Applicant did not \ndisclose any financial interests in Turkey other than the aforementioned real estate and \na $4,000 bank account.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nThere is no derogatory information in the file concerning Applicant\u2019s police or \nfinancial records. He has never been fired from a job. He has no police record, has \nnever used illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related incident. (Item 5)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted four letters of recommendation from officers in the U.S. \nArmy, who have worked with him.  In March 2005, a captain wrote that he started \nworking with Applicant in March 2004 when Applicant was one of the two interpreters \nassigned to the captain\u2019s unit. He is very complimentary of Applicant\u2019s work and \nprofessionalism. He learned to rely on Applicant and his ability to help the captain \naccomplish his mission. He noted, \u201cWithout [Applicant], we would have been in some \ntight situations.\u201d (Item 6 at 39) After working with Applicant for a year, a lieutenant \ncolonel (the commanding officer) stated in April 2005 that Applicant \u201cregularly \ndemonstrated exceptional bravery in conducting numerous raid operations. . . . He \nfunctions particularly well in support of security forces and police investigative units. His \nwork ethic is unmatched by anyone.\u201d (Item 6 at 38) In a letter of March 2007, the master \nsergeant for Applicant\u2019s task force wrote: \n \n\u201c[Applicant] distinguished himself as a skilled translator. His verbal \ntranslation skills, coupled with his intimate understanding of Iraqi customs, \nensured flawless cross-cultural communications between the Coalition \nforces and the Iraqi population. Many of his products were used to \nsuccessfully build target packets against enemies of the Unites States in \nthe war on terror. Despite highly stressful work conditions, extended work \nhours, and long periods of time away from home and family, [Applicant] \nconsistently preformed his duties to the best of his ability.\u201d (Item 6 at 41) \n \nThis master sergeant reiterated those compliments in a May 2008 follow-up letter \nof endorsement he wrote for Applicant.

Turkey cooperates closely with the \nU.S. on many security issues. \n  \n                                            \n2 All of the information under this section is from Items I through IV. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nTurkey, its citizens and foreigners in the country have been targeted by domestic \nand transnational terrorists groups for many years. There have been terrorist bombings \nin the past five years resulting in deaths. The targets have been religious, government, \ngovernment-owned, political, tourist and business locations throughout the country. In \naddition, leftist and Islamic terrorist groups have also targeted U.S. and Western \ninterests. Terrorist claimed connections with Al-Qaeda were responsible for suicide \nbombings in Istanbul in 2003. The potential for future terrorist attacks remains high. \n \n \nTurkey\u2019s judiciary is declared to be independent, but is in need of reform. The \nTurkish government generally respects the human rights of its citizens. However, there \nare some abuses among its security forces. There are other human rights abuses with \nrespect to detainees, criminal trials and personal freedoms.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9:  \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, and then he or she may be prone \nto provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests \nof the United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterest in another country; and \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \nApplicant exercised dual citizenship when he chose to renew his Turkish \nidentification card in 1995 and 2005, which he subsequently used to purchase property \nin Turkey in 2005 after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2000. Those facts \nare sufficient to raise a disqualification under AG \u00b6 10(a) (5) and AG \u00b6 10(b).   \nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nestablish any appropriate mitigating conditions. AG \u00b6 11 provides six conditions that \ncould potentially mitigate security concerns raised under this guideline: \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship;  \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U. S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \nApplicant has not expressed a willingness to relinquish his Turkish identification \ncard, which gives him the rights and privileges of Turkish citizens, including the right to \npurchase property. He did not produce evidence to support the application of any of the \nabove conditions.  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is articulated in AG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nIn 1992, Applicant briefly served in the Turkish government\u2019s army. He currently \nowns property and has a bank account there, with an estimated value of at least \n$184,000 (US). Because the Government has raised foreign influence security \nconcerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating \nconditions. \n \n  \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant\u2019s life in the United States and his connections to the United States \ndeveloped over the last 15 years tend to have some application to the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. His immediate family members are naturalized U.S. citizens, residing \nhere for many years. He owned a business for several years and worked at various jobs \nbefore securing his current position in December 2003. He destroyed his Turkish and \nIraqi passports. He is a dedicated U.S. citizen, making significant contributions to \nnational security and demonstrating that he will resist any attempts by a foreign power \nat exploitation. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) mitigates the security concern raised by Applicant\u2019s \nformer service in the Turkish army, and has some application to those concerns raised \nrelating to his ownership of property in Turkey.  \n \nApplicant has a substantial financial interest in Turkey that includes real estate \nand a bank account. About half of his net worth is in Turkey and half in the United \nStates.  Because Turkey\u2019s has been an ally of the United States for many years, it is \nunlikely that his real estate interest there will result in a conflict. Both AG \u00b6 8(b) and AG \n\u00b6 8(f) partially apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nSome facts in this record support foreign preference and foreign influence \nsecurity concerns because of Applicant\u2019s connections to Turkey. Applicant used his \nTurkish identification card to purchase real estate in Turkey, which is worth a substantial \namount of money. Although Turkey cooperates with the United States on many issues, \nthe possibility of terrorist attacks there remains high and situations involving abuses of \nhuman rights are present. There is a possibility that terrorists, aware of Applicant\u2019s \nownership of the property, could exploit him by threatening to destroy or damage it.  \n \n \nThe circumstances tending to support approval of a clearance for Applicant are \nmore significant. He is a mature individual. In 1993, he immigrated to the United States, \nshortly after mandatorily serving in the Turkish army for 58 days. He became a citizen in \n2000. His siblings and mother are naturalized U.S. citizens, residing here for many \nyears. He owned a business in the United States for six years. In October 2003, he \ndestroyed his Turkey and Iraqi passports. In December 2003, he volunteered to serve \nwith U.S. combat forces as a translator in Iraq. Reliable military personnel serving with \nhim in Iraq laud his duty performance and contributions to mission accomplishments. He \nhas put himself in harms\u2019 way since December 2003, working alongside U.S. armed \nforces in numerous operations. He has made significant contributions to national \nsecurity, fully aware of the risks to himself. He volunteered to return to work in Iraq in \n2006 after a serious heart attack. He would report any threats to harm him by foreign \nnationals. All these circumstances demonstrate that Applicant will recognize, resist, and \nreport any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group at coercion or \nexploitation. See ISCR Case No. 00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). Applicant\u2019s strong \nsense of loyalty to the United States and especially his employment as a translator in a \ncombat zone establish \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d  \n \nIn addition, Applicant held an Interim security clearance while working in Iraq up \nto recently without any indication that he breached security policies or procedures. \nWhile that fact is not normally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the \nAppeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the nation security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant carried his \nburden of mitigating the foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns. I do \nnot believe that he can be coerced into compromising his duty to the United States \nbecause of the valuable piece of property he owns in Turkey or his other connections to \nTurkey. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n   Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n   Subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

His first and second mortgagees were listed on the SOR and totaled \nabout $133,000. They went to foreclosure; however, results of the foreclosure sale are \nunknown. One SOR debt duplicated another SOR debt. Fourteen delinquent debts are \nnot resolved (total: about $25,000). He did not make any payments on these 14 \ndelinquent debts for more than a year. Applicant failed to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 19, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On October 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 6 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 3, 2008). GE 6 is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nDecember 23, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn October 28, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing (GE 8). Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on \nNovember 17, 2008, and on that same date the case was assigned to me. At the \nhearing held on December 10, 2008,2 Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GEs 1-\n4) (Transcript (Tr.) 17), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits (Tr. 10). There were no \nobjections, and I admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 18). Additionally, I admitted a Hearing Notice (GE \n5), the SOR (GE 6), and Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (GE 7). I received the \ntranscript on December 18, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the seventeen SOR \ndelinquent debts totaling about $168,000 (GE 7). His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.    \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee, who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2007 (Tr. 6, 20). His work is in communications or public \nrelations (Tr. 21). He has not had any unemployment since November 2007 (Tr. 36). \nApplicant earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Fine Arts in 1997 (Tr. 6, 19, 34). He has a part-\ntime entertainment job drawing pictures two days a week in the evenings (Tr. 20). He \ndoes not currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 7). He is married with four children \nages five, nine, eleven, and fourteen (Tr. 19). His wife has been a grade school teacher \nfor the last three years (Tr. 21). He has not served in the military (GE 1).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s security application did not disclose a felony conviction (GE 1).

Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nother delinquent SOR debts (GE 1). He received an Eagle Scout Award from the Boy \nScouts (GE 1).  \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for all 17 delinquent SOR debts, totaling about \n$168,000 (Tr. 22). He did not have arrangements with any of the creditors to pay his \ndebts (Tr. 22). His most recent contact with any of the SOR creditors was when he \ncommunicated with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($2,043) around April 2008, when he \ninformed the creditor that he was releasing the vehicle to a junkyard (Tr. 23). His next \nmost recent communication with a creditor occurred around January 2008, when he \ndiscussed repossession of the vehicle related to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o ($10,420) (Tr. \n23).  \n \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts is summarized in the table below: \n \nSOR PARAGRAPH AND \nTYPE OF DEBT \nAMOUNT\nSTATUS \n\u00b6 1.a Debt-home repair \n$66 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.b First Mortgage \n$102,824 \nUnknown Status (Tr. 25-26) \n\u00b6 1.c Online loan \n$908 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.d Vehicle loan \n$11,208 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.e Furniture purchase \n$2,248 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.f Not sure of debt\u2019s \nSource \n$87 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.g Second Mortgage \n$30,316 \nUnknown Status (Tr. 25-26) \n\u00b6 1.h Home depot credit \nAccount \n$934 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.i Unspecified debt \n$4,238 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.j Medical debt \n$100 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.k Utilities debt \n$106 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.l Car loan \n$2,043 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.m Unspecified debt \n$52 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.n Returned check \n$42 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.o Car loan \n \n$10,420 \nApplicant believes duplication of SOR \u00b6 1.d\n\u00b6 1.p Overdrawn bank \nAccount \n$302 \nDelinquent debt \n\u00b6 1.q Credit card \n$2,840 \nDelinquent debt \nTOTAL \n$168,734 \nAfter deducting mortgages and duplication \ntotal is: $25,174 \n \nApplicant planned to make arrangements with a financial advisor and debt \nconsolidation company to resolve his financial problems (Tr. 24, 27). He hoped to pay \noff the small debts first, and then the larger ones (Tr. 24). He wants to pay and plans to \npay his delinquent debts (Tr. 45). His financial counseling was at a preliminary stage, \n\n \n \n4 \n \ninvolving completion of forms rather than assembling a budget and a specific plan of \ndebt resolution (Tr. 28). In June 2007, Applicant learned about bankruptcy from a \nbankruptcy attorney (Tr. 26, 36-37). At that time, Applicant decided not to pay his debts \nbecause he planned to discharge them through bankruptcy (Tr. 37). However, he \nsubsequently decided not to seek discharge of his debts through bankruptcy (Tr. 26, 36-\n37). His problem with bankruptcy is paying the attorney and fees involved (Tr. 26-27).    \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage was foreclosed; however, he did not know the result of the \nforeclosure sale and had not learned whether he still owed any money or not on the \nmortgages (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g). In addition to the SOR debts, he owed $7,200 to a \nlandlord (Tr. 29). The debt to his landlord was being resolved with a $20 per month \npayment plan (Tr. 30). His wife had two student loans, and the federal government kept \n\u201ca lot of\u201d his tax refund (Tr. 30).  \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to ignorance, procrastination, \nunemployment in 2001, and underemployment when he was a car salesman and pizza \ndeliveryman (Tr. 31-33). He also noted the costs associated with caring for four children \n(Tr. 31, 32). In 2006, Applicant and his family moved to a different state where they now \nlive to increase their income (Tr. 33, 35). Applicant\u2019s residence in the state where he \nlived before 2006 went into foreclosure. \n \nApplicant rents his current resident for $1,430 per month (Tr. 37, 44). Applicant \nand his spouse own three vehicles: a 1997 Ford Taurus (received as a gift), a 1996 \nChevrolet Cavalier (currently no lien), and a 1997 Suburban (purchased in June 2008 \nand it has a $280 monthly payment due on lien) (Tr. 38). He does not own any stocks \nand bonds or have a 401K at work (Tr. 38). He does not have any other significant \nfinancial assets (Tr. 39). \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement indicates Applicant and his wife have \ntotal monthly net income of about $6,000, monthly expenses of about $3,500, and \nmonthly debt payments of about $600 (Tr. 39). His net monthly remainder is about \n$1,900 (Tr. 39).   \n \nA significant financial problem for Applicant is overdrafts on Applicant and his \nwife\u2019s joint checking account (Tr. 40). He thought the average number of monthly \noverdrafts was about eight (Tr. 41); however, in October 2008 they had about 30 \noverdrafts, resulting in bank costs of $36 per overdraft (Tr. 40-41). Applicant planned to \nmake elimination of overdrafts a priority in his future financial plan (Tr. 40-41). \n \nApplicant did not have any evaluations from his employer (Tr. 42-43). However, \nhe believed he would be described as dependable, responsible and a good worker (Tr. \n42-43).       \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n.  .  .  . SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent debt is documented in his credit report, his 2008 security clearance \napplication, his SOR response, and at his hearing. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleged 17 \ndelinquent debts, totaling about $168,000. His first and second mortgagees totaled \nabout $133,000 and went to foreclosure. Results of the foreclosure sale are unknown. \nOne debt was a duplication, leaving 14 delinquent debts, totaling abut $25,000. He did \nnot establish any payments on these 14 delinquent debts for the year prior to his \nhearing, even though he and his wife were employed in their current jobs. He did not \nestablish any track record of debt resolution of these 14 delinquent SOR debts. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \u201cOnce a \nconcern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has raised financial considerations security \nconcerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating \nconditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.       \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of any mitigating conditions. His \nfinancial problems are not isolated because he currently has 14 delinquent debts \ntotaling about $25,000. The ongoing nature of his delinquent debts is \u201ca continuing \ncourse of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2002)). Moreover, I am not convinced his debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [her] current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Although he has been paying some of his non-SOR \ndebts, he has failed to establish payments towards his SOR debts even though he and \nhis wife have been steadily employed for more than a year.   \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant\u2019s unemployment and underemployment contributed \nto his financial problems. As such, some of his debts are due to forces beyond his \ncontrol. However, he did not provide sufficient information to establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address his delinquent \ndebts especially those debts which remained delinquent even though he has been \nsteadily employed for at least year.4 He admitted that he has not maintained contact \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nwith his SOR creditors, and made very limited efforts to pay the 14 delinquent SOR \ndebts.     \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant did not complete financial \ncounseling. There are no indications that \u201cthat the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol\u201d because the amount of delinquent debt has been unchanged for at least the last \n12 months. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good \nfaith5 in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts because he did not establish that his \nfailure to pay his delinquent debts was reasonable and necessary under the \ncircumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant did not dispute his responsibility for \nany debts. I conclude Applicant\u2019s overall conduct in regard to his delinquent debts casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He failed to resolve \nor make payments to 14 creditors to whom he owed a total of about $25,000. He did not \nprovide good cause for his failure to set up payment plans and make some payments \ndespite having an opportunity to do so. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence \nas a whole, I conclude financial considerations are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n9 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. His dedication to his work, his family and his country is a very positive \nindication of his good character and trustworthiness. He improved his employability and \nprospects for greater income through his move to the state of his current residence. His \nwife completed her education and has full-time teaching employment. Applicant has a \npart-time job in addition to his employment with the federal contractor to increase his \nincome. He is completely loyal to his country. Applicant\u2019s hard work, record of good \nemployment and law-abiding character weigh in his favor. There is no evidence of any \nsecurity violation. His non-SOR debts are current and being paid. These factors show \nsome responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines are not sufficient to warrant his access to classified information at this time. \nThe overall amount of unresolved debt is about $25,000 and substantial. His mortgages \nwill be a security concern in the future, if he still owes the creditors money. He and his \nspouse have been continuously employed for the last year. They have the funds to \narrange and begin payment plans. One significant financial problem is they frequently \noverdraw their checking account and the resultant fees are an obviously avoidable \nexpense. Applicant has been aware of the security significance of his delinquent SOR \ndebts since he received the SOR in October 2008, and he did not take any material \nactions to resolve his delinquent debts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.      \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c to 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h to 1.n: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p to 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nOn February 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on April 15, \n2009, and issued a Notice of Hearing on May 11, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on June 11, 2009. Department counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6 into evidence, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified. He \ndid not offer any exhibits into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on May 27, 2008.  \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment counsel requested administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nEgypt. (Tr. 19) The request and the attached documents are included in the record as \nAdministrative Hearing Exhibits (AHE) I through VII. Applicant did not object to \nconsideration of those Exhibits. The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters \nof general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in Paragraphs \n1 through 3 of the SOR.

One sister is a housewife; one sister is a teacher in a \nChristian school; and one sister is an architect engineer for a private company. None of \nhis sisters or their husbands are affiliated with the Egyptian government. (Tr. 37) He has \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nunsuccessfully tried to help two sisters move to the United States. One of them has a \nfive-year visa for the United States and had lived here for a period of time. The third \nsister has applied for a Canadian visa.  He acknowledged that he has an extended \nfamily and friends living in Egypt. (Tr. 38) He maintains contact with his family and \nfriends in Egypt. \n \n \n Applicant traveled to Egypt in July 1999, January 2001, November 2001, \nJanuary 2002, July 2002, and March 2005.  In 1999, he and his family moved there in \nan effort to preserve his marriage, which had begun to deteriorate. His wife taught \nEnglish at an American school while there. He and his wife subsequently left and \nreturned to the United States. In 2001, he made trips to Egypt because his parents were \nill. His mother died in November 2001. Between July 2002 and March 2003, he stayed \nin Egypt because his father was very sick. (Tr. 51) While living in Egypt, his wife filed for \ndivorce in the United States. After learning that, he became romantically involved with a \nyoung woman, whom he married and then divorced after two weeks in order to avoid a \nscandal. (Tr. 52) \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant shipped two cars from the United States to Egypt because he \nthought he and his wife were going to live there. In 2002, he shipped another car. At the \ntime he shipped the cars, he had an Egyptian passport that allowed him to import the \ncars without paying custom taxes. Eventually, he sold the cars and deposited the \nproceeds into an Egyptian bank account. He believes he has about $17,500 in the \naccount.  He has not transferred that money to a U.S. bank because he does not want \nhis former wife to gain access to it. He wants it to remain available for emergencies. (Tr.  \n61) He does not have any other assets in Egypt. (GE 5)       \n \n \nApplicant received his first U.S. passport in June 1999, after becoming a \nnaturalized citizen. He also had an Egyptian passport until 2005 when he surrendered it \nto the company that is sponsoring him for a security clearance. It was then destroyed. \nHe used both passports, depending on which one made travel easier for him. (GE 2 at \n9; GE 5).   \n \n \nAfter September 11, 2001, Applicant decided to help the United States in its war \non terror. In 2004, he applied for an interpreter position with a federal contractor. In \npursuit of that position, he completed four security clearance applications: one in March \n2004, one in April 2007, one in October 2007, and one in December 2008. \n \n \nIn response to Question 27, Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activities-Illegal \nUse of Drugs on the March 2004 application, Applicant denied that he illegally used \ndrugs. (GE 4) In his three subsequent applications, he disclosed that he used marijuana \nonce or twice daily from 2001 to February 2004. In his Answer, he admitted that he \ndeliberately lied when he completed the March 2004 application because he wanted his \n\u201capplication to look good.\u201d (Tr. 68) \n \n \nIn further explaining the falsification, Applicant asserted that he was a different \nperson in March 2004 and that he has changed his life since then. At that time he was \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nin debt, used marijuana, and did not have a career, family, or home. He was in \u201cthe \nmiddle of a tornado.\u201d (Tr. 70) Today, he has a good relationship with his children, has \npaid several debts, and has a career as a professional driver. (Tr. 72-73) He stated that \nhe stopped using marijuana in February 2004. (Tr. 71) He has been dating an American \nwoman for several years with whom he lives.  \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he failed to disclose that he lived in Egypt from July 2002 \nand March 2003 in response to Section 8. Where You Have Lived on the March 2004 \napplication. He said that it was \u201c101 percent a na\u00efve mistake.\u201d (Tr. 63) At the time he \ncompleted the form, he was unaware of the importance of being completely accurate in \nhis answers because he did not know the significance of a security clearance. (Tr. 65) \nHe did not disclose the information in the April 2007 application. (GE 3) In the October \n2007 application, he disclosed that he lived in Egypt from January 2002 to April 2002. \n(GE 2) He did not disclose the information in the December 2008 application. (GE 1) \nSometime during the investigation, he informed the Government that he traveled to \nEgypt between July 2002 and March 2003. (GE 5) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he owes two law firms a total of $15,000 for legal \nfees attributable to his divorce. In May and June of this year, he made $50 payments to \neach firm for a total of $200. (Tr. 74-77) He intends to continue making those monthly \npayments until the delinquent debts are paid. All of his other debts are paid. (Tr. 74) \nCurrently, he earns approximately $50,000 annually through his business and hopes to \nearn $100,000 in the future. (Tr. 73, 81)   \n \n \nApplicant asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship. \u201cI am very proud of being \nAmerican.\u201d (Tr. 82)  \n \n \nEgypt \n \nEgypt is a populous republic with a developing economy. It has close relations \nwith the United States and shares a mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability. It \nreceives a substantial amount of U.S. foreign aid. Egypt\u2019s human rights record is poor \nand serious abuses continue to occur. Despite aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Egypt remains high. Terrorists in Egypt target U.S. \ninterests to exploit and undermine U.S. national security interests. Terrorist groups \nconduct intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.     \n \nPOLICIES \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nANALYSIS \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the Government\u2019s concern about foreign \ninfluence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\u201d1  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject \nthe individual to heightened risk or foreign influence or exploitation. \n  \n  \nApplicant maintains contact with his three sisters and their families who are \nresident citizens of Egypt. Although Egypt has a close relationship with the United \nStates, it continues to have human rights issues and has been victimized by terrorist \nattacks. This fact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure or coercion, and a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n(b) have been raised by the evidence. Applicant also maintains a bank account there, \nraising a concern under AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to the Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the \nresulting security concerns.  Four Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 \nare potentially applicable to the disqualifying conditions: \n \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant\u2019s siblings do not work for the Egyptian government or other companies \nor institutions that would have interest in acquiring protected information. Only their \nphysical presence in Egypt creates a potential that their well-being could be threatened \nto the point that Applicant would confront a choice between their interests and those of \nthe United States. Based on Egypt\u2019s relationship with the United States and his siblings\u2019 \nprofessions, I find it unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the Egyptian government and those of the United \nStates, if and when he obtains a position as an interpreter in another country. AG \u00b6 8(a) \nhas some application. \n \nApplicant produced some evidence establishing the limited application of AG \u00b6 \n8(b). He has strong connections and feelings for the United States where he and his \nchildren reside. He has been a naturalized citizen since 1999. He has an American \ngirlfriend with whom he lives. He has worked in the United States since 1994 and now \nowns his own business. Those facts tend to indicate that he can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s communication and relationships \nwith his siblings are more than casual and not infrequent. Since leaving Egypt in 1994, \nhe has returned to see his family in 1999, in 2002, and 2005. From July 2002 to March \n2003, he lived there. These visits, along with his attempts to obtain U.S. citizenship for \ntwo sisters and his ongoing communication with them, demonstrate his deep \nconnections to his family.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant intends to maintain his $17,500 Egyptian bank account because he \ndoes not want his former wife to have access to it and needs it for any emergencies. \nGiven his reliance on that account, AG \u00b6 8(f) cannot apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government\u2019s security concern pertaining to personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15:       \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nOne Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is particularly relevant and \npotentially disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 16(a) provides that the \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d may raise a security \nconcern. Applicant incorrectly answered two questions on the March 2004 security \nclearance application. He denied that he intentionally falsified his answer to one \nquestion and admitted that he deliberately lied in the other.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his March 2004 security clearance \napplication because he did not disclose that he resided in Egypt from July 2002 to \nMarch. Applicant admitted the omission and asserted he made a mistake when he \ncompleted the application. After listening to him and observing his demeanor, I believe \nthat the omission was an oversight. Hence, this allegation is found in his favor. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified his initial March 2004 \nsecurity clearance application because he did not disclose that he used marijuana on a \ndaily basis between January 2001 and February 2004, approximately one month before \nhe completed the application. Applicant admitted that he lied. Hence, the disqualifying \ncondition set forth in AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes six conditions that could mitigate the security concern arising \nunder this guideline. I have considered four of them: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use in the April 2007 security clearance, \napproximately three years after he completed his initial application. It is not clear when \nhe voluntarily disclosed it or whether it was prior to April 2007. Hence, there is \ninsufficient evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 17(a) as to the allegation in SOR \n\u00b6 2.b. The offense was not so minor as to be mitigated by the passage of five years. \nNeither AG \u00b6 17(c) or AG \u00b6 7(d) have application. Applicant produced evidence that he \nhas taken steps to reduce his vulnerability to duress based on his subsequent \ndisclosure of his former drug use. AG \u00b6 7(e) has some application.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admitted that he has a $15,000 delinquent debt that dates back to \n2003-2004 and relates to his divorce. The evidence raised the above disqualifications. \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I \nconsidered three of them: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \nThe delinquent debt relates to legal fees Applicant incurred during his 2003 \ndivorce. That situation was beyond his control. However, there is no evidence that he \ntook responsible action to resolve the debt until April 2009. Hence, AG \u00b6 20 (b) does not \nhave full application. Other than his testimony, Applicant did not present evidence that \nhe received any financial counseling or that his financial situation is under control. \nAlthough he submitted evidence that within the past two months he paid $100 to each \nlaw firm and that he intends to continue making payments in the future, he did not \nprovide a written agreement confirming that arrangement. There is insufficient evidence \nto apply either AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d).  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors (APF) listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): They are as follows:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nIn Foreign Influence cases, the Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis \naddress \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an \napplicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or \nher social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nSome mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature educated person, who came to the United States in 1994 to \nmarry his wife and start a family. Both of his children were born in the United States and \nreside here. He has a strong sense of patriotism toward the United States. He \nsurrendered his Egyptian passport in 2005, when he learned that it posed an obstacle to \nobtaining a security clearance. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action that \ncould cause potential harm to the United States.  \n \nSeveral circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  \nFirst, there is a significant risk of terrorism and various human rights abuses in Egypt. \nMore importantly for security purposes, terrorists are hostile to the United States and \nactively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even friendly governments, could \nattempt to use Applicant\u2019s siblings to obtain such information. Second, he had \nnumerous connections to Egypt before he permanently immigrated to the United States \nin 1994, including his education and numerous family members and friends, who \ncontinue to reside there. Third, his three sisters are resident citizens of Egypt with whom \nhe maintains (admirably) close contact. Fourth, he has a financial interest in a bank \naccount there that he wants to save for emergencies. Fifth, since becoming a U. S. \ncitizen in June 1999, he made seven trips to Egypt, the last being in 2005. During one of \nthose trips, he remained seven months and married a woman, whom he shortly \nthereafter divorced. Sixth, he relied on his dual citizenship in 1999 and 2002 to import \ncars and circumvent custom taxes. His ties to Egypt are not insignificant.   \n \nIn addition to those facts, I also considered Applicant\u2019s decision to falsify his \nMarch 2004 security application regarding his three years of illegal marijuana use. \nAlthough he repeatedly asserted that he has changed his life since 2004 and that he \nwould never falsify information requested from the Government again, he did not \nsufficiently demonstrate a pattern of exercising good judgment or document a track \nrecord of financial responsibility at this time. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson, and listening to Applicant testify, I have serious concerns about his eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising under foreign influence, personal conduct, and \nfinancial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n12\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaires for investigations processing (e-\nQIP) on November 27, 2006. On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 9, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on June 17, 2009. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on June 18, 2009.  \nApplicant received the FORM on June 24, 2009. He had 30 days to submit a response \nto the FORM. He did not submit a response. On August 14, 2009, the FORM was \nforwarded to the hearing office and was assigned to me on August 19, 2009. Based \nSeptember 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.c, 1.f, and 2.a \u2013 2.c. He denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. (Item 3)  \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old mechanical engineer with a Department of Defense \ncontractor. He seeks to maintain his security clearance.  He has held a security \nclearance since August 2001. He received his undergraduate degree in August 2000. \nHe received a master\u2019s degree in June 2003. He is single and has no children. (Item 4)   \n \nOn April 1, 2002, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to an investigator \nconducting his background investigation.  In the statement, he summarized his past \nillegal marijuana use. He listed marijuana use once in May 1995, two times in June \n1999, once in June 2000, once in August 2001, and March 2002. He smoked marijuana \nin social settings with either friends from college or his roommates. (Item 7 at 5-6) At the \nend of his statement, Applicant made the following statement with regard to future \nmarijuana use: \n \n\u2026.I will never use marijuana again. I don\u2019t like it and it makes no sense. I \nwanted to try marijuana before because of curiousity. But, I know I don\u2019t \nlike it, I won\u2019t try marijuana or any other drug again. (Item 7 at 6)  \n \nAfter this investigation, Applicant was granted a security clearance. (I conclude \nthis based on the fact that Applicant indicated he has held a security clearance since \nAugust 2001 in response to section 26(a) on his e-QIP application, dated November 27, \n2006. He also admits that he was granted a security clearance in November 2001 in his \nresponse to the SOR.)   \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant signed a statement as part of his employment \nagreement that he would not use illegal drugs. In October 2006, he smoked marijuana \nwith a friend.  Applicant felt uncomfortable about violating the no illegal drug use policy. \nHe self-reported his illegal marijuana usage to his company\u2019s security office. (Item 6 at \n3) \n \nThere is some confusion in the record as to when Applicant self-reported his \nillegal marijuana use to his security office. His e-QIP application signed by Applicant on \nNovember 27, 2006, refers to self-reporting his marijuana use in October 2006. (Item 4, \nsection 24) In his response to the SOR, Applicant provided a copy of a memorandum \nsummarizing Applicant\u2019s self-reporting of illegal marijuana use. The memorandum is \ndated October 25, 2007. The memorandum refers to the subject of \u201cIllegal Substance \nSept 07.\u201d The body of the memorandum is a statement by Applicant where he admits to \nusing marijuana in September 2006. (Item 3 at 6) I conclude the memorandum is \nincorrectly dated. It should have been dated October 25, 2006, considering Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \n \nattached this memorandum to the e-QIP application that he completed in November \n2006. Based on the record evidence Applicant used marijuana on one occasion \nbetween September 2006 and October 2006. \n \nOn June 11, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator in conjunction \nwith another security clearance background investigation.  The investigator prepared an \nunsworn summary of Applicant\u2019s interview.  Applicant admitted to using marijuana from \nMay 1995 to October 2006. He used marijuana for the first time at age 16 in May 1995. \nHe did not use marijuana again until the fall of 1999. From 1999 until he graduated in \nJune 2000, Appellant used marijuana on approximately 10 to 15 occasions while a \ncollege student.  After graduating from college, the unsworn summary claims Applicant \nsaid he did not use marijuana because it was not accessible to him. Applicant told the \ninvestigator that his future intent with regard to marijuana use was to not use marijuana \nor any illegal drugs because he does not want to jeopardize his career. (Item 6 at 3) \n \nIn response to interrogatories, notarized by Applicant on September 10, 2008, \nApplicant states that his last use of illegal drugs was in September 2007. (Item 5, \nsection 1.d) He also admits to using marijuana in September 2007 in his response to \nthe SOR. (Item 3, SOR \u00b6 2.a) \n \nNo evidence was submitted pertaining to Applicant\u2019s duty performance or other \nwhole person factors. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG &24:       \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) & 25(a) (any drug \nabuse) applies to Applicant\u2019s case. He illegally used marijuana from May 1995 to at \nleast September 2007.  While the record evidence does not indicate Applicant was a \nhabitual user, his marijuana use cannot be considered a one-time experimental event. \nHe used marijuana on several occasions while in high school and college. He used \nmarijuana on at least three occasions after graduating from college (i.e. March 2002, \nSeptember/October 2006, and September 2007) \n \nApplicant admits that he used marijuana after being granted a security clearance \nin November 2001.  DI DC \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance) applies.   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nOn two occasions, Applicant stated that he did not intend to use illegal marijuana \nin the future, only to revert to marijuana use.  On April 1, 2002, he stated that he no \nlonger intended to use marijuana, only to use marijuana again on one occasion in \nSeptember/October 2006. On June 11, 2007, he told an investigator conducting his \nbackground investigation that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. Three \nmonths later in September 2007, he used marijuana. His failure to follow through with \nhis intentions to refrain from illegal drug use raises DI DC \u00b6 25(h) (expressed intent to \ncontinue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue \ndrug use).          \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) \n\u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant used \nmarijuana on numerous occasions after being granted a security clearance. He \nexpressed an intent to refrain from further marijuana use on two occasions, only to \ndecide to use marijuana despite his expressed intentions. While Applicant self-disclosed \nhis September 2006 marijuana use to his security office, he used marijuana again in \nSeptember 2007 as evidenced by his answer to interrogatories on September 10, 2008, \nand his admission to SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant\u2019s continued use of marijuana after \nexpressing an intent to refrain from further use raises questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability.  \n \n \nThe second mitigating condition that potentially applies is FC MC & 26(b) (a \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation \nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment \nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.) Although \nApplicant states he does not intend to use marijuana ever again, he has made this \nassertion several times over the past seven years. However, he seems to use \nmarijuana if he socializes with a friend who happens to have marijuana. I cannot \nconclude Applicant no longer associates with friends who use marijuana. Although he \nhas not used marijuana for close to two years, I cannot conclude that an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence has occurred because of Applicant\u2019s history of continued marijuana \nuse contrary to his expressed intentions not to use marijuana in the future. \n \n  \nApplicant has not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThere are specific disqualifying conditions which may be raised. Applicant\u2019s \nstatement to an authorized investigator for the Department of Defense on June 11, \n2007, that he did not use marijuana after college graduation in June 2000 to October \n2006 when he, in fact, used marijuana in August 2001 and March 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \nraises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative). However, Applicant previously disclosed his August 2001 and March \n2002 marijuana use in a signed, sworn statement, dated April 1, 2002. Considering that \nhe previously disclosed his post-college drug use to the government prior to his June \n11, 2007, interview, I conclude that his falsification was not material.  Personal Conduct \nMitigating Condition (PC MC) \u00b6 17 (c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies with respect to the allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f.  \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group) applies. Applicant\u2019s concealment of his marijuana use, in \nparticular, while holding a security clearance made him vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation or duress.    \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(f) (violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment) applies. Applicant was aware \nof his employer\u2019s policy of no illegal drug use. In September 2006, he signed a \nstatement notifying his employer that he would not use illegal drugs. He used marijuana \napproximately one month later.  He also admits to using marijuana in September 2007. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern may be mitigated. The following Personal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) does not apply. While Applicant should be commended for self-\ndisclosing his illegal marijuana use in October 2006, it was not the first time that he \nused illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. In fact he admits to using \nmarijuana in September 2007, close to one year after his self disclosure. He continued \nto use marijuana after making statements in 2002 and 2007 that he no longer intended \nto use illegal drugs. Given his past conduct of reverting back to marijuana use despite \nexpressing intentions to the contrary, his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment \nremain in question. \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) does not apply. Applicant \nself disclosed his October 2006 illegal drug use to his security office. However, he used \nmarijuana approximately one year later in September 2007.  His continued use of \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance demonstrates unreliable and untrustworthy \nbehavior.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) applies. While Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use while holding a security clearance made him vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, he is no longer vulnerable because he fully disclosed his past \nmarijuana use during his security investigation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has history of recreational \nmarijuana use over a period of eight years. He used marijuana on several occasions \nafter having been granted a security clearance and after expressing his intentions to \nrefrain from further illegal drug use. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised under drug involvement and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
