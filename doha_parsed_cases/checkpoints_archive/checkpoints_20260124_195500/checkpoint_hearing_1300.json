The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 5, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 11, 2019. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on November 6, 2019, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on December 3, 2019.  The Government offered seven exhibits, referred to \nas Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. The \nApplicant offered eleven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through K, which \nwere admitted without objection.  Applicant also testified on her own behalf. The record \n\n \n2 \n \nremained open until close of business on December 17, 2019, to allow Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted eight \nexhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 8, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on December 11, 2019. \n \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and divorced with three adult children.  She has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in information technology.  She holds the positon of journeyman for a \ndefense contractor.  She seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her \nemployment in the defense industry.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 17 delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $66,150.  Her student loan debt totals approximately $53,000 of the total.  \nThe remaining debt is miscellaneous consumer and medical debt.  Applicant also failed \nto timely file her Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016.  She \nwas indebted to the state for back taxes owed for tax years 2016 and 2017.  In her \nAnswer, Applicant admits each of the allegations and provides explanations.  Credit \nreports of the Applicant dated November 3, 2014; June 21, 2017; August 2, 2018; and \nAugust 28, 2019, reflect that each of these debts was at one point owing.  (Government \nExhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7.)  \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Navy for twenty years from \n1984 until 2004, when she was honorably discharged.  Her military record shows that \nshe experienced financial difficulties then.  She applied for and obtained a security \nclearance while in the military in 1989.  In 1992, due to financial difficulties, her security \nclearance was suspended for about a 90-day period, and was then reinstated.  (Tr. p. \n41.)  After she retired, she became a full-time college student, using her GI bill, and \nworked two jobs.   She states that ever since she retired from the Navy, she has owed \ntaxes.  (Tr. p. 44.)  \n \n \nApplicant admits that she failed to file her Federal income tax returns on time.  \nShe has no good excuse for not filing her income tax returns on time other than poor \ntime management, and anticipating that she would owe taxes that she did not have the \nmoney to pay.  Applicant has at times lived beyond her means.  Since her interview in \n2018 concerning her security clearance, she has been diligent about paying her bills on \ntime and living within her means.  She now follows a budget and keeps a monthly \nbudget book to keep close track of her bills.  Each month she records all of her bills and \nwhere her money goes.  After paying all of her monthly expenses, she has about $500 \nleft in discretionary funds.  Applicant has worked for a defense contractor for about \ntwelve years.  A security clearance is necessary for her position.   \n \n \nAllegations 1.a. through 1.j., concern a number of student loans Applicant \nobtained in order to complete her college degree.  Applicant provided a copy of a letter \nshe received regarding her student loan consolidation application to lower her monthly \n\n \n3 \n \npayments on her student loans.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  In June 2018, she entered a \nloan rehabilitation program and completed the program in February 2019.  On October \n2019, due to financial hardship, Applicant filed a general forbearance request that was \napproved.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  Since 2008, Applicant has made payments, off and \non, toward her student loans, and has been in forbearance once before.  Her latest \nagreement will allow her to pay $104 monthly for ten years to pay off her student loan of \n$53,000.  (Tr. pp. 64-65.)      \n \n \nAllegation 1.k., is a debt owed to a department store that was charged off in the \namount of $573.  Applicant has settled the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and Tr. p. 67.) \n \n \nAllegation 1.l., is a debt owed to a creditor on an account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $175.  Applicant settled this debt on August 9, 2019.  (Tr. \npp. 67-68 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n \n \nAllegation 1.m., is a debt owed to a creditor for account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $4,706.  Applicant proposed a settlement offer \nof $1,416.32 that was accepted to resolve the debt for less than originally owed.  \nPayments were made in the amount of $50 beginning December 13, 2019, and then \nevery month thereafter until June 12, 2020, in the amount of $227.72 monthly at which \ntime the matter will be settled.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 5.)   \n \n \nAllegation 1.n., is a debt owed to a creditor that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $870.  Applicant settled this account for $434.94 on August 7, \n2019.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.) \n \n \nAllegation 1.o., is a medical bill that was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $782.  Applicant has settled this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 4.) \n \n \nAllegation 1.p., is a debt owed to a creditor for an account placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $600.  Applicant settled the debt for $389.90 on September \n11, 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I.) \n \n \nAllegation 1.q., is a medical bill that was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $69.  Applicant has settled this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  \n \n \nAllegation 1.r., concern Applicant\u2019s failure to file her Federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, in a timely fashion.  Applicant has now filed these \nreturns, paid any Federal taxes owed, and has provided copies of these tax returns.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)  \n \n \nAllegations 1s. and 1.t., concern Applicant\u2019s delinquent back taxes owed to the \nstate for tax year 2017 in the amount of $520, and for tax year 2016 in the amount of \n$528.  Applicant has since paid all of her state back taxes in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K.)  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant is not normally provided a performance evaluation, she asked \nher supervisor for one and was provided it.  Her performance evaluation dated \n\n \n4 \n \nDecember 17, 2019, reflects that she \u201cmeets\u201d and \u201cexceeds\u201d the goals and objectives of \nher job.  She also excels at resolving issues and situations with little support from her \nsupervisor.  It is also recommended that she take some classes to improve her abilities \nand skillset on emerging technology.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 3.)  \n \n \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s mother, who resides with the Applicant, and who the \nApplicant takes care of, alludes to Applicant\u2019s hard working nature, trustworthiness, \nreliability and good judgment.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 6.) \n \n \nApplicant also provided a receipt for payment of a debt that was not alleged in \nthe SOR to show good faith.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n5 \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant took out student loans and lived beyond her means, which prevented \nher from being able to pay her bills.  She now clearly understands that in order to \nremain employed in the defense industry she must live within her means and pay her \nbills on time.  She must also file her tax returns on time and pay the required taxes \nowed each year.  Because she was unable to pay her debts and taxes and became \ndelinquently indebted, the evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant served honorably in the Navy for twenty years.  Since retiring she went \nto college and obtained her Bachelor\u2019s degree.  She is now working for a defense \ncontractor and is still desiring to contribute to her country.  Applicant\u2019s poor time \nmanagement and spending beyond her means in the past caused her to acquire more \ndebt than she could afford to pay.  Since 2018, after her security clearance interview, \nshe has seemed to gain a better understanding of the importance of paying her bills on \ntime, filing her income tax returns in a timely fashion, and paying her taxes.  She has \npaid off much of her delinquent debt.  Although she is now in forbearance with regard to \nher student loans, she has the discretionary funds available to pay them when it is lifted.  \nHer finances have been stabilizing, and she is making regular monthly payments toward \nher delinquent debts.  She has completely paid off her Federal and state taxes.  She \nhas also filed all of the Federal and state income tax returns in question.  She has acted \nreasonably and responsibly under the circumstances.  She has significantly reduced her \ndebt and continues to work toward doing so.  Applicant is now on the correct financial \npath.  There are clear indications that her financial problems of the past are being \nresolved and are under control.  She has also demonstrated a good-faith effort to \nresolve her debts. The Financial Considerations concern has been mitigated.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  Applicant is a \nhonorably retired Navy Veteran who has worked for a defense contractor for the past \ntwelve years. She supports her elderly mother who resides with her.  Applicant is a hard \nworker and has made some poor decisions in the past regarding her finances.  She now \nunderstands that she must be responsible with her financial affairs in every aspect of \nher life in order to hold and maintain a security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.t.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He served in the British Army from 1977 to his \nretirement in October 2012. (SOR 1.a) He was deployed to a number of locations and \nearned periodic promotions. He was a lieutenant colonel at the time of his retirement. (GE \n1 at 16-17; Tr. 11, 29-30) \nFrom 1996 until his retirement in 2012, Applicant held a British equivalent of a U.S. \ntop secret security clearance. The clearance was essential for access to meetings in the \nUnited States with U.S. federal agencies, U.S. Army installations, and geographic data \ncenters. As his military career evolved, Applicant\u2019s initial working relationship with U.S. \ncounterparts began in 1996 when he worked in the intelligence community at the British \nMinistry of Defense. The ministry had a U.S. liaison office. While deploying to several \ndestinations abroad, the information Applicant collected was shared only with \ncounterparts in the U.S. intelligence community. (GE 1 at 227; Tr. 37-38) \nIn the 1999 to 2002 time period, Applicant transferred to operational-oriented \ndeployments where he travelled to different countries to provide assistance at the various \nembassies. A substantial number of deployments were at various locations in Africa, \nwhich became his area of expertise. At the end of this deployment, he was promoted to \nlieutenant colonel. (Tr. 32, 36) \nFrom 2002 to 2005, Applicant (employed as a British Army officer) was stationed \nat his first job in the U.S. working with American, British, Canadian, Australian, and New \nZealand counterparts in the administration of several projects. He also traveled to various \ncountries for conferences and workshops. (Tr. 32, 36) \nFrom February to August 2006, Applicant attended the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) Defense College and received the equivalent of a master\u2019s degree \nin military-oriented international studies.

(GE 1 at 13, \n156-173; Tr. 30-31) \nFrom the end of 2006 to 2010, Applicant was assigned to an Army base (Fort \nBenning, Georgia) in the Southeastern United States, then a base (Fort Campbell, \nKentucky) in the U.S. Midwest, then a base in the middle Atlantic (Fort Bragg, North \nCarolina), or all the bases on a staggered basis, where, as Senior British Liaison Officer, \nhe would perform liaison duties by filtering information from the U.S. armor units, infantry \nunits, and Special Forces to their counterparts in the United Kingdom. He also participated \nin pre-deployment training and technology development preparation for the U.S. \ndepartments and their U.K. counterparts. Applicant performed these liaison duties until \n2010. He attended several joint business meetings with U.K. and U.S. personnel or with \nofficials from the British Ministry of Defense during the period. Applicant submitted several \ncharacter references from U.S. military officers who served with him at the U.S. Army \nbases during the period. (GE 1 at 22, 176- 187; Tr. 32-33) \nIn 2010, Applicant knew he would be retiring in 2012, so he decided to accept two \nback-to-back operational deployments. The first was the Chief of Operations for a U.S. \njoint task force located in Djibouti, Africa. Applicant was one of two foreign-based officers \nat that location where he served until July 2011. After receiving some supplemental \ntraining in the second half of 2011, Applicant (employed by the British Army) was deployed \nto South Sudan, Africa, to serve as Chief of Joint Operations to the United Nations (UN) \nMission, and also a special representative to UN Secretary General. He served there from \nDecember 2011 to May 2012. In October 2012, Applicant (age 55) retired from the British \nArmy as a lieutenant colonel. His British security clearance terminated upon his \nretirement. (GE 1 at 16-24, 196-210; Tr. 35-39, 59-60) \nFollowing his military retirement in October 2012, Applicant was self-employed in \nthe United States as a consultant in international risk and crisis management until April \n2016. He had no clientele and earned no income. He devoted this period to researching \nand developing case studies related to international crisis management in Africa, his field \nof expertise. He and his wife paid their living expenses with his British military pension, \nthe sale of his U.K. home in June 2012, and his wife\u2019s real estate earnings. (GE 1 at 15; \nTr. 65-69) \nSince April 2016, Applicant has been employed as a senior national security \nadviser with a U.S. defense contractor, working for the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction \nAgency. He was hired for the position because his employer was searching for an African \nexpert with instructional capabilities and technical expertise. His primary responsibilities \nare to: (1) help guide programs with partner countries in Africa; (2) help those countries \ndevelop counter-proliferation strategies against weapons of mass destruction; and (3) \nwork in his capacity as senior instructor with other U.S. agencies to deliver training to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate the various threats in the partner countries. Applicant never had any security or \ndisciplinary problems while in the British Army, or working with his American counterparts, \nor at his current employment. He has never been pressured or coerced because of his \nposition. He has never received emails requesting information about his employment. In \nhis current position, he receives regular training on how to handle outside contacts. Before \nhe embarks on foreign duty travel, he submits pre-departure forms and on his return, he \nreceives post-travel debriefings. Applicant\u2019s last trip to the United Kingdom was to see his \ntwo daughters in 2017; he has no plans to return. (GE 1 at 14; Tr. 38, 70-71, 87-89) \nApplicant was asked about his listed British contacts (identified in his July 2016 e-\nQIP) who served with him while he was in the British Army. As senior British liaison officer, \nApplicant supervised a British warrant officer (currently a captain) while at Fort Benning \nin 2006. Applicant, who previously contacted this individual by email or social media once \nor twice a year, has had no contact for two years. Applicant speculated that he may have \nretired recently. (GE 1 at 25; Tr. 43-45) \nApplicant provided yearly evaluations for a British major, who was an exchange \nofficer with the U.S. Army and a technical staff writer at Fort Benning in 2010. This \nindividual has retired from the British Army and joined a private company in the United \nKingdom. Applicant described his social media contact with this individual as intermittent, \nwith his last contact of the individual at a June 2019 charity event. (GE 1 at 27; Tr. 44-45) \nAnother British lieutenant colonel was part of Applicant\u2019s team in 2009 working as \nan instructor at the armor location in Fort Knox, Kentucky. Applicant contacted him by \nsocial media once or twice a year, with his last contact in 2018. The lieutenant colonel \nhas been deployed to another duty location for the past two years. (GE 1 at 27; Tr. 45-\n46) \nAnother British major was Applicant\u2019s exchange officer assigned to a combat unit \nat Fort Campbell, Kentucky in 2009. Applicant has infrequent contact once or twice a year \nand last saw him on social media in June 2019. He is retired and currently employed as \na motivational speaker for small businesses in the U.K. (GE 1 at 27-28; Tr. 46-47) \nApplicant explained that his contact with the next British soldier began in 1992 \nwhen this soldier was his junior operations officer. Applicant believes he is still serving in \nthe British Army. Applicant had infrequent email contact and last time Applicant saw him \nwas at a restaurant four or five years ago. (GE 1 at 30; Tr. 48-49) \nApplicant has known the next British officer since 1985. The individual was \nApplicant\u2019s junior operating officer and logistic lead. Applicant believes that he is still \nserving in the British Army at another location as a military advisor. Applicant emailed this \nindividual one or two times a year. Applicant\u2019s last social media contact was one or two \nyears ago.

Applicant and this officer have remained friends, with Applicant \ncontacting him quarterly. He is the only person that knows Applicant works for his present \nemployer. He and his wife reside with Applicant during their yearly U.S. visits. None of the \naforementioned British officers know Applicant is applying for a security clearance or have \nasked about his work in the United States.

(GE 1 at 117-120; Tr. 50-53) \nWhile working at the British Ministry of Defense in the intelligence community \nApplicant in 1996, Applicant met a male British civilian analyst in 1997. This analyst is still \nemployed by the British government. Though Applicant characterized their relationship as \nfriendly, with Applicant contacting him quarterly in 2016, Applicant\u2019s contact has become \nless frequent because the analyst is married and raising a child. (GE 1 at 111-113; Tr. 54) \nA female British civilian analyst and Applicant initially worked together at British \nMinistry of Defense in 1996. In 2016, the female analyst was still working at the ministry \nand Applicant saw her occasionally when he traveled through the United Kingdom. In \n2016, Applicant contacted her quarterly through social media contact. The last time he \nsaw her was at a dinner with a mutual friend (U.S. citizen) in 2018. This same mutual \nfriend informed the two British civilian analysts that Applicant was contracting for the U.S. \nDefense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Applicant surmised that the female analyst \nknew he was applying for a security clearance. The mutual friend (U.S. citizen) in the \nprevious paragraph is currently working for a federal agency. She knows that Applicant is \napplying for a security clearance (GE 1 at 111-114; Tr. 53-57) \nUpon his retirement at age 55 from the British Army in October 2012, Applicant \nbegan receiving a military pension (SOR 1.b) based on his military service. After \nconducting a review of the pension system in 2005, the British Ministry of Defense \nchanged the payout structure of the system by providing active Army service personnel \nthe option of remaining in the existing pension system or transferring to a new system. \nApplicant opted for the new system allowing him to collect a tax-free amount of money at \nretirement and taking a reduced pension for 10 years, then receiving another lump sum \nat age 65 (SOR 2.d), followed by a full pension. The lump sum amount to be distributed \nin 2022 will be approximately $200,000 (SOR 2.d). His wife\u2019s 60% survivorship interest is \ndoubled under the new pension system.

In fact, our clients, who all have high-level \nclearances, routinely request [Applicant] by name to assist them with \nplanning or to accompany them on missions. This is a clear reflection of \ntheir trust in his judgment and value. (AE B) \nReference C, a retired 3-star general in the U.S. Army, with 35 years of service, is \ncurrently the chief executive officer of a military support organization serving injured \nservice members. In late 2006, when he was Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army at \nFort Benning, Georgia, he met Applicant, the Senior British Liaison Officer to the U.S. \nArmy Infantry, who was assigned to the same base and other bases in the Midwest and \nNortheastern part of the United States. Applicant consistently demonstrated exceptional \nability as a leader in executing his job responsibilities. Reference C strongly believes that \nApplicant qualifies for a security clearance. (AE C) \nReference D, a U.S. citizen, has been friends with Applicant for about 20 years. As \nApplicant was nearing retirement from the military, he repeatedly mentioned his affinity \nfor the United States and the privilege of applying his expertise to mission projects for the \nU.S. Government. (AE D) \nReference E, a retired U.S. Army colonel, has known Applicant since serving with \nhim in 2008 at Fort Benning. As Applicant was reaching military retirement, his thoughts \nabout becoming a U.S. citizen increased. He encouraged his two daughters to consider \nU.S. citizenship. Reference E recommends Applicant for a security clearance.

When reference F was an FBI agent, she worked in \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism division. She worked with counterparts from \nseveral allied countries, with the U.K. being America\u2019s closest ally. The FBI counterparts \nhad dual citizenship and also U.S. security clearances. In recommending Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance, Reference F writes: \nAs an FBI Special Agent, I\u2019ve worked extensively in Counterintelligence and \nCounterterrorism. In that capacity[,] I have worked bi-laterally with services \nfrom the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; the UK being our closest \nally.

These individuals also still have family in \nthose countries and have dual citizenship; and yet hold the highest US \nsecurity clearance. These individuals, like [Applicant] enhance the FBI just \nas [Applicant] enhances the DTRA/ICP. (AE F) \nReference G, a retired colonel from the U.S. Army, has spent 30 years in the \nmilitary. He met Applicant in August 2007 at Fort Benning, Georgia. Reference G and \nApplicant were both liaison officers to the commanding general of the infantry school. \nThey interacted daily to weekly until reference G was reassigned in 2009. They continued \ntheir friendship through social media. Applicant is a loyal American citizen who has no \npreference for another country. Reference G endorses Applicant\u2019s security clearance \napplication. (AE G) \nReference H, a colonel in the U.S. Army, has known Applicant since 2007 when \nhe was the Senior British Liaison Officer at Fort Benning, Georgia. Applicant earned a \nreputation of providing detailed advice in the coordination of British and U.S. staff to \nensure integration of priorities for the U.K. and U.S. staffs. His participation with the \ninstructional programs of U.S. Army\u2019s Officer Candidate School (OCS) was invaluable. \nReference H believes Applicant qualifies for a security clearance. (AE H) \nReference I is a retired colonel with 31 years of service in the U.S. Army. As with \nseveral of the above references, he met Applicant in 2008 at the U.S. Army base in Fort \nBenning, Georgia. Applicant was the Senior British Liaison Officer and reference I was \npart of a training unit. They worked together occasionally in Infantry Center events to ease \nthe transition for newly commissioned officers, new infantry officers, and new officer \ncandidates. Reference I learned that Applicant developed a reputation for attention to \ndetail and dedication to mission projects. Reference I has kept in contact with Applicant \nthrough social media. He considers Applicant trustworthy and a loyal American who \nmerits a security clearance. (AE I) \nApplicant\u2019s wife since 2003 and a naturalized U.S. citizen, believes that Applicant \nis an honorable person with high integrity. In addition to his retirement account with his \nemployer, he has an income retirement account (IRA). He received the U.S. Meritorious \nService Medal in 2011. He donates to several U.S. charitable organizations. Applicant\u2019s \nwife has been living in the United States since 2002. (AE J) \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 United Kingdom \nThe United Kingdom, a constitutional monarchy, has a foreign policy that \nemphasizes close collaboration with the United States, its strongest ally. The United \nKingdom and the United States have been the allies in almost every regional or worldwide \nconflict except Vietnam. The two countries have similar cultures, a common language, \nand democratic principles that have helped sustain their longstanding and friendly \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelationship. Both countries share extensive links in their international relations that \nextend from commercial contacts to political and defense cooperation. The two countries \nbelong to several international organizations advocating world peace and security. The \ntwo countries consistently consult each other on foreign policies and objectives while \npromoting mutual security policy goals. The United Kingdom was a founding member of \nNATO. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nForeign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9. When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a \npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she \nmay provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States. Foreign involvement raises concerns \nabout an individual's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is \nin conflict with U.S. national interests or when the individual acts to \nconceal it. By itself ; the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another \ncountry is not disqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict \nor attempt at concealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise \nof any right orprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or \nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued \nby any country other than the United States; \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of \nemployment, position, or political office in a foreign \ngovernment or military organization; and \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts \nwith U.S. national security interests; \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests \nin another country in violation of U.S. law;  \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions. \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship to the United Kingdom and the United States \nestablishes AG \u00b6 10(a). He was born in Rhodesia, a U.K. colony in southern Africa. His \nservice in the British Army from 1977 to October 2012 falls within the scope of AG \u00b6 \n10(d)(1). However, AG \u00b6 10(d)(2) does not apply as there is no evidence his British military \nservice ever conflicted with U.S national security interests before or since his retirement \nfrom the British military in October 2012. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(b) nor 10(c) apply because \nApplicant surrendered his U.K. passport in April 2015, and there is no record evidence \nindicating that he used his U.K. passport after he was issued U.S. passport in April 2014. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 11 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the \nforeign citizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n(d) the exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen; \n(e) the exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do \nnot present a national security concern; \n(f) the foreign preference, if detected, involves a foreign country, entity, \nor association that poses a low national security risk; \n(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, \nor the employment or service was otherwise consented to as required \nby U.S. law; and \n(h) any potentially disqualifying activity took place after receiving the \napproval by the agency head or designee. \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security interests \nand there is no evidence that Applicant has acted in a way that indicates a preference for \na foreign country over the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a) and 11(b) apply. Applicant has not \nexpressed a willingness to renounce his U.K. citizenship. However, there is no objective \nevidence that his foreign citizenship is in conflict with U.S. national security interests. AG \n11(c) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s 35 years of military service entitled him to a military pension after his \ndischarge in October 2012. When he reaches 65 years of age, he will be entitled to the \nU.K.\u2019s version of U.S. Social Security. The current and future military pension payments \nwere activated in October 2012 based on Applicant\u2019s service in the British Army. Both the \nmilitary pension and Applicant\u2019s future entitlement to the British retirement fund occurred \nbefore he became a U.S. citizen and do not present a national security concern. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n11(d) and 11(e) apply. Lastly, the Government\u2019s administrative notice documents and \nrecord evidence show that the foreign preference poses a negligible national security risk. \nAG \u00b6 11(f) applies. Finally, based on GE 1, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the character \nendorsements, it is reasonable to infer that Applicant\u2019s military service with his American \ncounterparts, including assignment to U.S. installations, during a large portion of his \nmilitary career was authorized under U.S. law. AG \u00b6 11(g) applies. \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation;  \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value of or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAssessments of foreign contacts under AG \u00b6 6 should include the type of \ngovernment in the foreign country where the contacts are located. The risk of coercion is \nsignificantly greater in a country with an authoritarian government, or when the country \ntargets U.S. citizens for protected information, or when the country is associated with \nterrorism. The distinction between friendly and unfriendly nations should be made \ncarefully because friendly nations have committed espionage against the United States. \nThe United Kingdom, a constitutional democracy, does not target U.S. citizens for \nprotected information and, like the United States, is a victim and not a sponsor of \nterrorism. \nThe Government\u2019s position (as presented in their administrative notice \nmemorandum, HE 1) in this case is that the heightened risk of foreign influence concern \n(AG \u00b6 7(a)) emanates from Applicant\u2019s status as a retired British military officer with a \nforeign bank account, a military pension and pension annuity, his continuing contacts with \nhis brother (a retired British officer) and other active and retired British officers, including \ntwo high-ranking officers, rather than the specific conditions of the United Kingdom. The \nGovernment\u2019s position appears in ISCR Case No. 17-03026 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, \n2019. However, in that case Applicant\u2019s contacts to other retired and active British military \nofficers were substantive allegations in the SOR. The only substantive allegation in this \ncase regarding military contacts is Applicant\u2019s brother who retired in 2017 as a British \nmilitary officer (SOR 2.a). Applicant\u2019s continuing contacts with active and retired British \nofficers, other than his brother, were not alleged in the SOR, and may not be an \nindependent basis for denying his application for a security clearance. These continuing \ncontacts may be considered to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility; to decide whether a \nparticular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence in extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; or in the whole person analysis. ISCR Case No. \n03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I have considered the \nunalleged contact with active and retired British officers for these limited purposes. \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn March 4, 2019, the administrative judge found in his decision after remand of \nthe above-cited case that a heightened risk of foreign influence under AG \u00b6 7(a) was not \nestablished. \u201cThe amicable and cooperative relationships between the United States and \nthe United Kingdom and their armed forces and shared ideals and democratic practices \nare inconsistent with the manipulative measures contemplated by AG \u00b6 7(a).\u201d See, ISCR \nCase No. 17-03026, Remand Decision at 9. I agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion and adopt \nit in this case. Applicant\u2019s status as a retired British military officer, and his continuing \ncontacts with his brother, a British military officer (SOR 2.a) who has been retired for two \nyears, do not create a heightened risk of foreign influence under AG \u00b6 7(a). Even though \nApplicant maintains infrequent to regular contacts with retired and active duty British \nmilitary officers, I find those contacts raise no security concerns given the close \nrelationship the United States has to the United Kingdom. In addition, I conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s British financial interests do not subject him to a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence under AG \u00b6 7(f). \nApplicant\u2019s continuing regular contacts with his brother, a retired British military \nofficer (SOR 2.a), create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b) between his desire \nto safeguard protected information and technology and his desire to help his brother. The \npotential conflict is sufficiently mitigated with his brother\u2019s retirement in 2017. There is \nnothing problematic about Applicant\u2019s contacts with his two British daughters. The oldest \ndaughter is on a sabbatical from her human relations job, and the youngest daughter has \njust received her bachelor\u2019s degree in business. There is no evidence indicating that they \nare affiliated with any foreign government. \nApplicant\u2019s British bank account of about $2,000 (SOR 2.c) and his British pension \nannuity of $200,000 (SOR 2.d) are his remaining British financial interests. The bank \naccount receives and temporarily holds Applicant\u2019s monthly military pension payments \n(SOR 1.b) until he transfers the payment to a U.S. bank account a few days later. The \npension annuity represents a lump sum payment under the British military pension system \nrevised in 2005, authorizing him to draw a reduced pension benefit until 2022 (age 65), \nwhen he receives a lump sum. The U.K. financial interests could subject Applicant to a \nheightened risk of foreign influence as defined by AG \u00b6 7(f). Though the total amount of \nforeign financial interests are not insignificant, the combined value of the British bank \naccount and pension annuity is less than 24% of Applicant\u2019s total financial assets in the \nUnited States. In sum, the foreign financial interests do not result in a conflict of interest \nthat could be used to successfully influence or pressure Applicant. Because the financial \ninterests are located in the United Kingdom, a longstanding and close ally of America, AG \n\u00b6 8(f) applies. \nIn his July 2016 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed the names of nine British military \nofficers (including two high-ranking officers) that he served with during his career. \nApplicant complied with the reporting requirements regarding the reporting of contacts. \nAG \u00b6 8(e) applies. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence and foreign preference \nguidelines in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access \nto classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nFrom 1977 to October 2012, Applicant served in the British Army. As indicated in \nthe factual findings, from 1996 to 2012, he participated in joint operations in some capacity \nwith American counterparts. Between 2002 and 2005, he was stationed at his first job in \nthe United States working with western allies on various projects. Between 2006 and \n2010, he was the senior British liaison officer at several Army forts in the Eastern and \nMidwestern United States. Based on their interaction with Applicant during those years, \nfive retired and active military officers recommended him for a security clearance. (AE C, \nE, G, H, I, J) \nApplicant decided to immigrate to the United States in 2010. Following two \noperational deployments from 2010 to 2011 (Chief of Operations of a U.S. task force), \nand from 2011 to 2012 (Chief of Joint Operations at the UN Mission), Applicant retired in \nOctober 2012. \nAfter becoming a U.S. citizen in April 2014, Applicant\u2019s employment supervisor \nsince he was hired in April 2016, described Applicant as the \u201cmodel\u201d employee. The \nsupervisor directed special attention to Applicant\u2019s dedication to national security and his \nunswerving commitment to the mission. Applicant\u2019s supervisor recommends him for a \nsecurity clearance. (AE B) A colleague and former FBI agent, recommends Applicant for \na security clearance based on his organizational skills, as well as his expertise as a \nsubject matter expert on Africa issues. Considering the evidence from an overall \ncommonsense point of view, Applicant has met his burden of mitigating the security \nconcerns based on the guidelines for foreign preference and foreign influence. \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline C): \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B):  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She is a high school graduate. She has never been married and has no children. She has been working for her current employer and security sponsor since October 2002. She is a level three (senior) research assistant. In 2003, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) granted Applicant eligibility for a position of trust, and she has held it to present. In her responses to Sections 22 (Police Record) and 24 (Use of Alcohol) of her 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed a history of alcohol-related offenses. The background investigation provided additional details about the security concerns alleged in the SOR. Applicant admitted all of the Guideline G allegations with some clarifications (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.g), and denied all of the Guideline J allegations (SOR 2.a \u2013 2.d). Her SOR admissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: 1. In 2006, Applicant was charged with drinking an alcoholic beverage in a retail area and second degree assault. Both charges were nolle prosequi. (SOR 1.a; GE 3). 2.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/31/2020 \nDecision \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has a history of alcohol abuse, marked by four driving while impaired \n(DWI)-driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol convictions, and numerous traffic \noffenses. Her last alcohol-related offense occurred in 2017. She has established a \npattern of abstinence, modified behavior, and rehabilitation. Alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 5, 2017, \nseeking a clearance required for her position with a federal contractor. After reviewing \nthe information gathered during the background investigation, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on June 21, 2019, alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and J (criminal conduct). \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 11, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nDOHA assigned the case to me on November 20, 2019. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on February 4, 2020, setting the hearing for February 20, 2020. At the hearing, \nthe Government offered 13 exhibits (GE 1 through 13). Applicant testified and submitted \n\n \n2 \n \n \ntwo exhibits (AE 1 and 2). AE 2 was received post-hearing. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 28, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She is a high school \ngraduate. She has never been married and has no children. She has been working for \nher current employer and security sponsor since October 2002. She is a level three \n(senior) research assistant. In 2003, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ngranted Applicant eligibility for a position of trust, and she has held it to present. \n \nIn her responses to Sections 22 (Police Record) and 24 (Use of Alcohol) of her \n2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed a history of alcohol-related offenses. The background \ninvestigation provided additional details about the security concerns alleged in the SOR. \n \nApplicant admitted all of the Guideline G allegations with some clarifications \n(SOR 1.a \u2013 1.g), and denied all of the Guideline J allegations (SOR 2.a \u2013 2.d). Her SOR \nadmissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n1. In 2006, Applicant was charged with drinking an alcoholic beverage in a retail \narea and second degree assault. Both charges were nolle prosequi. (SOR 1.a; GE 3).  \n \n2. In February 2008, Applicant was charged with driving while impaired by \nalcohol, assault second degree, disorderly conduct, and failure to obey a lawful order. \nShe pleaded guilty to the charge of driving while impaired by alcohol, and was adjudged \nprobation before judgment. The probation was extended until December 2009. (SOR \n1.b; GE 4.a, 4.b, and 4.c) She was required to remain abstinent during the probation \nperiod. She successfully complete her probation. \n \n3. Between April and May 2008, Applicant received alcohol-related counseling (a \nsix week, 12 hour education program) and was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder - \nmild. (SOR 1.c; GE 11) \n \n4. In January 2011, Applicant was arrested for driving while impaired by alcohol, \nand she pleaded guilty to the offense. She was placed on supervised probation. (SOR \n1.d; GE 5)  \n \n5. Between March and October 2011, Applicant received alcohol-related \ncounseling (a 26-week treatment program) and was diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder - severe. She was required to remain abstinent during the probation period. \n(SOR 1.e; GE 11) \n \n6. In June 2014, Applicant was arrested for driving while impaired by alcohol. \nShe was found guilty of the offense in February 2015, and was sentenced to 60 days \n\n \n3 \n \n \nconfinement (58 days suspended), placed on a weekender\u2019s work program, and on \nsupervised probation and parole. (SOR 1.f; GE 6.a - 6.c) \n \n7. Between August and September 2014, Applicant successfully participated in a \n28-day residential recovery and treatment program. In December 2015, she completed \nthe subsequent 48-week aftercare group counseling program. (GE 12) \n \n8. In April 2017, Applicant was arrested for driving while under the influence of \nalcohol. She was found guilty of the offense in February 2018, and was sentenced to \none-year of supervised probation. She was also charged with failure to display her \ndriver\u2019s license, failure to drive in right half, failure to stop at a stop sign, failure to drive \nto curb upon signal by police, and taking a left turn from improper position. All of these \nrelated traffic offenses were placed on a STET (inactive) docket following Applicant\u2019s \nguilty plea to DUI. (SOR 1.g; GE 7.a, 7.b) \n \n9. In June 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving a vehicle not \nequipped with an ignition interlock. She pleaded not guilty, and the charge was later \nnolle prosequi. She also was charged with driving on a suspended license. She pleaded \nguilty and was found guilty of the charge in January 2018. She was sentenced to one-\nyear of confinement (suspended for 30 days). She appealed the sentence to the Circuit \nCourt, apparently requesting a consolidation of other pending traffic offenses. The \nCircuit Court considered the appeal and entered its verdict in March 2018. Applicant \nwas sentenced to two-years of supervised probation with conditions, and a $1,000 fine, \nsuspended. (GE 8, 10) \n \n10. In September 2017, Applicant was charged with failure to display her driver\u2019s \nlicense to a police officer, driving on a suspended license, and driving without a license. \nAll charges were nolle prosequi, apparently, as a result of a consolidation of traffic \noffenses and plea agreement concerning the offenses and court proceedings discussed \nin paragraph 9, above. (GE 8, 9, and 10) \n \n11. In April 2018, Applicant was admitted to an outpatient recovery center and \ntreatment program sponsored by the state. During the rehabilitation phase, she \nattended three-hour meetings, three times a week, for a total of 20-30 sessions over a \nperiod of two months. During the continued care phase, she attended 75 group therapy \nsessions, once a week, in addition to Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meetings. There is no \nevidence of her return to alcohol use during the treatment program, as evidenced by her \nnegative drug and alcohol screens, the last one taken in November 2019. Applicant was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate-severe. She is considered to have made \nexcellent progress while in the treatment program. Her prognosis for continued sobriety \nis considered to be good with her continued investment in community meetings and \nutilizing a sober support network. (See GE 13, AE 1, and AE 2) \n \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleged the alcohol-related offenses alleged \nunder Guideline G (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g). For the sake of brevity, my findings \n\n \n4 \n \n \nof facts related to all of the offenses alleged under Guideline G, above, are incorporated \ninto my findings under Guideline J. \n \nSOR 2.b alleged that in June 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nchanging lanes where prohibited, driving a vehicle not equipped with an ignition \ninterlock, and driving on suspended license. The allegation of \u201cchanging lanes where \nprohibited\u201d is not established by the documentary evidence. The other two traffic \noffenses are established by the evidence and are discussed above in paragraph 8. \n \nSOR 2.c alleged that in September 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith failure to display her driver\u2019s license to a police officer, driving on a suspended \nlicense, and driving without a license. These charges are established by the evidence \nand discussed in paragraph 10, above. \n \nSOR 2.d alleged that in January 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndriving a vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock and driving on suspended \nlicense. These two traffic offenses did not occur in January 2018. As discussed above in \nparagraphs 9 and 10, these offenses occurred in June 2017. The court adjudicated the \noffenses in January \u2013 March 2018. (GE 8, 9, 10) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of two witnesses \u201cWM\u201d and \u201cWA\u201d. \nWM is Applicant\u2019s onsite program manager at the federal facility where she works. WM \nhas supervised Applicant since 2003. WM testified that through the years, Applicant has \nbeen instrumental in doing all the purchasing, preparation, and setting up the facilities to \naccomplish their mission. Applicant is also in charge of training all of the new lower-level \nresearch assistants. She described Applicant's work as intricate, and requiring planning, \ndedication, attention to detail, and reliability. \n \nIn 17 years, WM never had any trouble with Applicant showing up to work late or \nnot doing her job. She is liked by the staff and their customers. There has never been \nany alcohol-related incidents at work. \n \nApplicant was candid with WM and disclosed her alcohol-related problems. WM \nwas surprised about Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems because there was no indication in \nher work performance that she was having any problems. Applicant always comes to \nwork on time, gets along well with coworkers and clients. WM would like Applicant to get \nher clearance and to come back to work. She believes it would be detrimental to her \ndepartment and the research mission if Applicant was removed from her position. (Tr. \n68-69) \n \nWA has been Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor since 2006. They have daily contact \nand interact with each other several times a day. She described Applicant as \u201cone of my \nmost important employees because she knows everything and does everything.\u201d WA \nconsiders Applicant to be an extremely reliable and responsible person, not only within \nthe work environment, but also when taking care of her team members and her family. \nWA considers Applicant to be and essential member of the team. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has oversight of logistics, training, equipment (purchasing and \nmaintenance), and the trouble shooting of unexpected problems. She is a reliable \ncustodian of controlled substances. Applicant disclosed her alcohol-related problems to \nWA when she was incarcerated as a result of one of her DWI convictions. WA has \nfrequently followed up with Applicant about her attendance to meetings and participating \nin the therapy program. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant presented three favorable reference statements from \ncolleagues and friends. The references consider Applicant to be highly skilled, \nknowledgeable, conscientious, ethical, dedicated to the mission, extremely dependable, \nreliable, and punctual. Applicant displays a high level of attention to detail regarding her \nduties. She is considered to be one of the top research assistants, and the go-to person \nfor mentoring new staff. All of the references endorsed Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nclearance without reservations. \n \nApplicant credibly expressed remorse for her alcohol-related misconduct. She \nunderstands that she needs help to control her alcohol consumption. She has learned a \nhard lesson and promised to be responsible in the future.  \n \nApplicant testified that she has been abstinent since May 2017. She is grateful \nfor the intensive treatment she received at the outpatient recovery center and treatment \nprogram sponsored by the state between 2018 and November 2019. She was given \nmedications and intensive therapy to develop the tools needed to stop consuming \nalcohol. She believes that the treatment she received at prior counseling-rehabilitation \nfacilities was superficial, requiring only for her to show up, and did not assist her with \nher alcohol problems. She attributed her alcohol problems to a coping mechanism to \ndeal with the loss of family members, and her emotional and financial problems. \n \nApplicant has made lifestyle changes to stop her from consuming alcohol. She is \nnow living with her family. Her family provides the emotional support she needs to \nremain abstinent. She believes that she has been working very hard in her recovery. \nShe is committed to remaining sober, being healthy, and helping others with similar \nproblems. She is concerned about not getting her clearance, losing her job, and not \nbeing able to provide financial support for her elderly parents and siblings. (Tr. 61-62) \nApplicant noted that her past alcohol consumption caused financial problems that led to \nher losing her house in a foreclosure. Applicant\u2019s family depends on her income and \nshe does not want to fail or let her family down. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol abuse covering the period from 2006 through \n2017. Her four DUI-DWI convictions and numerous alcohol-related traffic offenses \ndemonstrate that she has consumed alcohol excessively and to the point of impaired \njudgment. She was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. The record establishes the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides for mitigating conditions that may be applicable to this case:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and the individual has successfully \ncompleted a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last DUI-DWI offense occurred in April 2017, and there is no \nevidence of any alcohol-related misconduct after 2017. Between April and November \n2018, Applicant successfully participated in an intensive alcohol detoxification and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrehabilitation program. She has continued with aftercare treatment and made lifestyle \nchanges because she wanted to end the problems related to her alcohol consumption. \nShe is now residing with her family. They provide her with the environment and support \nshe needs to remain sober. I find that Applicant has demonstrated that her excessive \nconsumption of alcohol and her alcohol-related criminal behavior are unlikely to recur.  \n \nI considered that Applicant participated in alcohol counseling programs in 2008, \n2011, and 2014, and relapsed each time after a short period of abstinence following the \ncompletion of the counseling programs. Applicant credibly explained that those \neducational or counseling programs were not as effective as the last program she \nattended in 2018. She described the last program as more intensive, with medications \nto help her stop drinking, and extensive therapy sessions. Moreover, Applicant noted \nthat her past alcohol consumption caused financial problems that led to her losing her \nhouse in a foreclosure. Applicant\u2019s family depends on her income and she does not \nwant to fail or let her family down. \n \nApplicant loves her job. She is very concerned about her eligibility for a clearance \nand being able to continue working as a research assistant for her employer of 17 \nyears. She is also compelled to continue her sobriety by her parents\u2019 and siblings \nfinancial dependence on her. I believe that it is unlikely that Applicant will engage in any \nfuture alcohol-related misconduct. She credibly promised to avoid any further alcohol-\nrelated incidents. More importantly, as a result of the clearance process, she clearly \nunderstands that her eligibility for a clearance and her job depend on she remaining \nsober. \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-term supervisors consider her to be extremely dependable, \ndedicated, reliable, punctual, trustworthy, and a great asset. She displayed leadership \nby mentoring and training new research assistants. I find that Applicant has \ndemonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that the \nquestionable judgment associated with his alcohol-related misconduct is behind her.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleged the alcohol-related offenses alleged \nunder Guideline G (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g). For the sake of brevity, my findings \nand conclusions related to all of the offenses alleged under Guideline G, above, are \nincorporated into my findings under Guideline J. \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal involvement is directly related to her alcohol \nconsumption. She has four DUI-DWI convictions and was involved in numerous traffic \noffenses. Her driver\u2019s license was suspended numerous time as a result of her alcohol-\n\n \n9 \n \n \nrelated offenses. Moreover, she was cited several times for driving without a license. \nShe was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. Applicant\u2019s behavior raises the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline could be mitigated under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 32:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nFor the same reasons articulated under my discussion of the Guideline G \nmitigating conditions, incorporated herein, I find that the above mitigating conditions \napply to this case and mitigate the Guideline J security concerns. Applicant has \nestablished a reputation for being trustworthy, loyal, and a great asset. She displayed \nleadership, and she is considered to be dependable and reliable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of these factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \nApplicant, 46, has been working for her employer, a federal contractor, since \n2003. Two character witnesses described her as an excellent employee who is \ndedicated to mission accomplishment. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant should have been more responsible consuming alcohol and obeying \nthe traffic laws. Notwithstanding, I believe that after 2017, she has demonstrated a \npattern of modified behavior and rehabilitation. Applicant is fully aware of the security \nconcerns raised by her alcohol consumption and related criminal behavior. She \npromised to remain sober and to obey the traffic laws to ensure that she continues to be \neligible for a clearance. She understands that if she is involved in any additional alcohol-\nrelated misconduct her clearance eligibility could be denied. The alcohol consumption \nand criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking access to classified information for the first time. He is employed as an electrical engineer with a federal contractor that does business in the defense industry. (Exhibits A, B, and C) He has never married and has no children. Applicant was a top student in high school, which he completed in 2006. He then attended a large, public university on scholarship to study electrical engineering. He dropped out after his second year after losing a scholarship due to poor academic performance. He attributed his difficulties to feeling overwhelmed by the large university community and the large classes with hundreds of students. His second attempt to study electrical engineering, albeit at a different university, ended after one semester. In 2009, after due consideration, he enrolled at a smaller state university with the goal of becoming a high school science teacher. He excelled, graduated cum laude, and was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Education (Science Education/Physics) in May 2012. (Exhibits E, F, and H) Applicant began his first job teaching high school in August 2012. He resigned in December 2012 after being informed of allegations that he engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old female student from a different school in an adjacent state. (Exhibits 3 and 4) About six months later in June 2013, in response to an official investigation, he elected to voluntarily surrender his certificate",

He did not make deliberately false or \nmisleading statements about the nature of his relationship with the minor student when \nhe completed a security clearance application in 2017 or during his background \ninvestigation in 2018. The questionable judgment he exercised in 2012 is mitigated as \nminor misconduct and by the passage of time without recurrence. Accordingly, this case \nis decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non July 28, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on March 20, 2019, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \n\n \n2 \n \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline E for personal conduct. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 11, 2019. He provided a three-page \nmemorandum in which he admitted resigning from his job as a teacher due to the \nrelationship with a minor, but he denied the two falsification allegations.   \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on August 1, 2019, and then reassigned \nto me on August 9, 2019. The hearing took place as scheduled on September 24, 2019. \nDepartment Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1 -\n4. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A - I. Other \nthan Applicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nOctober 2, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking access to classified \ninformation for the first time. He is employed as an electrical engineer with a federal \ncontractor that does business in the defense industry. (Exhibits A, B, and C) He has \nnever married and has no children.  \n  \nApplicant was a top student in high school, which he completed in 2006. He then \nattended a large, public university on scholarship to study electrical engineering. He \ndropped out after his second year after losing a scholarship due to poor academic \nperformance. He attributed his difficulties to feeling overwhelmed by the large university \ncommunity and the large classes with hundreds of students. His second attempt to \nstudy electrical engineering, albeit at a different university, ended after one semester. In \n2009, after due consideration, he enrolled at a smaller state university with the goal of \nbecoming a high school science teacher. He excelled, graduated cum laude, and was \nawarded a Bachelor of Science in Education (Science Education/Physics) in May 2012. \n(Exhibits E, F, and H) \n \nApplicant began his first job teaching high school in August 2012. He resigned in \nDecember 2012 after being informed of allegations that he engaged in an inappropriate \nrelationship with a 17-year-old female student from a different school in an adjacent \nstate. (Exhibits 3 and 4) About six months later in June 2013, in response to an official \ninvestigation, he elected to voluntarily surrender his certificate to practice as an \neducator in the state. (Exhibits 3 and 4) He was prohibited from applying for a new \ncertificate or reinstatement for three years. No criminal charges were brought against \nApplicant and he was never interviewed by law enforcement.  \n \nAbout 18 months later in August 2014, Applicant returned to his alma mater with \na renewed commitment to study electrical engineering. He excelled, graduated magna \ncum laude, and was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in May \n\n \n3 \n \n2017. (Exhibits D, F and G) He began his current job a few months later in July 2017, \nand he completed a security clearance application the same month. (Exhibit 1) \n \nIn response to questions about his employment history, Applicant disclosed his \nresignation from his job as a high school science teacher in December 2012. He stated \nthat he left the job by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct. \nHe then provided a lengthy explanation of the circumstances surrounding his \nresignation: \n \nAt the time I was 24 years old, and in late October of 2012 I became \ninvolved in a close, non-physical relationship with a girl in another state \nwho was 17. The extent of our relationship was texting, and meeting for \nlunch occasionally. She knew who I was, she knew my age, and I knew \nhers. I believed that there was no conflict for my position, since the girl \nneither lived in the state nor was my student, but the school saw it as a \nviolation of the state ethics policy for teachers. They asked me to leave \nwith pay while they investigated the incident. The investigation into the \nmatter returned only that there was an emotional relationship, nothing \nmore. No charges were brought [against] me, but they did decide that, \nbeing an emotional relationship with a minor, it was in violation of state \nethics rules for teachers. I was told I could have a public hearing on the \nissue to determine if I could keep my position, or I could resign from my \nposition. I chose to resign. At the end of the school year, the Board of \nEducation made the decision to relieve me of my [state] teaching license, \non the grounds that I violated their ethics policy, and I was prevented from \nteaching in [the state] for a period of three years. That time is now \ncomplete, and I am free to reapply for a teaching position in [the state] if I \nso choose. (Exhibit 1 at 29)  \n \nThe incident was reviewed and discussed during Applicant\u2019s 2018 background \ninvestigation. During an interview, which was summarized in written form, he described \nthe relationship with the minor student as \u201cfriendly and not physical.\u201d (Exhibit 2 at 5) His \noverall description of the relationship was consistent with the description in his 2017 \nsecurity clearance application. \n \nApplicant believes he did not engage in a physical relationship with the minor \nstudent because there was no sexual activity between them. He explained that \u201ca \nphysical relationship would involve sex at the very least and probably lots of kissing, a \nlot of kissing, a lot of touching. And we did none of that, so the relationship, a friendship \nwas largely just texting. We had occasionally - - held hands once at a movie that we \nwent to.\u201d (Tr. 34-35) He admits they held hands on occasion and there was a single kiss \nwhen they ended the relationship. (Tr. 63-64) He described the kiss as a quick, friendly \nkiss as opposed to a romantic kiss. (Tr. 36) They had formed an emotional bond and felt \nclose to each other, but there was no sexual activity, and that was the extent of their \nrelationship during October - December 2012.   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions:  \n                                                          \n1\n \n 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nAddressing the two falsification allegations first, the disqualifying conditions at \nAG \u00b6 16(a) and AG \u00b6 16(b) do not apply here. I am not persuaded that Applicant made \ndeliberately false, deceptive, or misleading statements in his 2017 security clearance \napplication or during the 2018 background investigation when he described the \nrelationship with the minor student as a non-physical friendship. The extent of the \nphysical contact or touching between Applicant and the minor student was quite limited; \nnamely, the occasional hand-holding and a single kiss goodbye. The primary activities \nduring their relatively brief relationship was talking when meeting for lunch and \nengaging in electronic or digital communications. In addition, Applicant gave an \nextensive account of the circumstances surrounding the relationship and the resulting \njob loss in both his security clearance application and during the background \ninvestigation, as noted in the findings of fact. Given all these facts and circumstances, \nApplicant\u2019s description of the relationship with the minor student as a non-physical \nfriendship was not objectively unreasonable. Accordingly, his description of the \nrelationship was not deliberately false, deceptive, or misleading.   \n \n \nTurning next to the underlying misconduct, Applicant certainly exercised \nquestionable judgment when he allowed himself as a 24-year-old first year teacher to \nhave a close, emotional friendship with a 17-year-old minor high school student, \nregardless that she was a student in another school in an adjacent state. It was a line \nhe should not have crossed. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. Nevertheless, his questionable \njudgment in 2012 is mitigated as minor misconduct and by the passage of time without \nrecurrence. He is now eligible to reapply for a teaching certificate. Moreover, he used \nthe incident to redirect his life back to electrical engineering, he obtained the required \nbachelor\u2019s degree with high honors, and he is now employed in the field. These matters \n\n \n6 \n \nare considered as evidence of successful rehabilitation, and Applicant is credited \naccordingly. Overall, the mitigating condition found at AG \u00b6 17(c) applies.  \n   \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts and \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility granted.  \n \n \n \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.         \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn November 3, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 10, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \n\n \n2                                        \n \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines B, C, F, and E. (HE 2) On July \n11, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3) On October \n17, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR adding an \nadditional SOR allegation in \u00b6 3.c under Guideline E. (HE 5) In an undated response, \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 3.c. (HE 5)  \n \nOn November 13, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On November \n26, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On December 31, 2019, DOHA issued a notice, \nsetting Applicant\u2019s hearing for January 8, 2020. (HE 1) Applicant waived his right to 15 \ndays of notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. (Tr. 11) The hearing was held \nas scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 9 exhibits; Applicant offered 19 \nexhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 17, 19-20; GE 1-9; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE S) On January 16, 2020, \nDOHA received a transcript of the hearing.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Nigeria.

(Tr. 18; GE 9) The parties \nagreed that I could also take administrative notice of information from the State \nDepartment website pertaining to Nigeria. (Tr. 18-19) \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

(GE 3 at 2) In August 2016, he was issued a Nigerian passport. (GE 3 at 2) He \nwas issued the Nigerian passport to enable him to visit Nigeria without obtaining a Nigerian \nvisa. (Tr. 28, 43; GE 3 at 2-3)  At his hearing, he said he presented his Nigerian and United \nStates passports when he went to Nigeria and his U.S. passport when he entered the \nUnited States. (Tr. 42-44) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used his Nigerian passport in lieu of his United \nStates passport to exit and enter the United States in about December 2011, May 2015, \nand August 2016. (SOR response to \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c) It also alleges that he intends to \ncontinue using his Nigerian passport in lieu of his United States passport to exit and enter \nthe United States so long as it is authorized under security rules. (SOR answer to \u00b6 2.d at \n4; GE 3 at 2) Applicant said he used his Nigerian passport in 2011, 2015, and 2016; \nhowever, he did not initially explain how he used it. (Tr. 26-27)  \n \nApplicant visited Nigeria as follows: from December 2011, to January 2012; from \nMay 2015, to June 2015; and from August 2016 to September 2016. (GE 1) In 2013, \nApplicant sent about $25,000 withdrawn from his retirement fund to his father to help his \nfather pay for home repairs. (Tr. 40-42; GE 3 at 7) In July 2016, he paid $14,000 for his \nfather\u2019s funeral. (Tr. 41; GE 3 at 7) He has not traveled to Nigeria after 2016. (Tr. 24, 60-\n61) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was born in Panama, and she is a U.S. citizen. (GE 1) Both of \nher parents are U.S. citizens, and her father was serving in Panama with the U.S. Army \nwhen she was born. (GE 1) Applicant votes in U.S. elections. (AE L; SOR response at 4) \nApplicant\u2019s child was born in the United States and resides in the United States. (GE 1) \nApplicant has been a resident of the United States for 25 years. (SOR response at 4) \nApplicant denied that he has any preference for Nigeria. (SOR response at 4) Applicant is \nwilling to renounce his Nigerian citizenship if security officials request that he do so.

(SOR response to \u00b6 3.b; GE 7) He was not convicted of any \noffense as a result of the April 2004 altercation with his spouse. (SOR response at 6) \nApplicant was unable to remember or unwilling to disclose details of the April 2004 \naltercation with his spouse at his hearing. (Tr. 31, 54) \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant and his spouse had another physical altercation. She was \na petty officer first class, and Applicant and his spouse were living on base in government \nhousing overseas. (GE 6 at 9) They were in bed, and she was insulting him. (GE 6 at 9) \nApplicant described the physical altercation to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \n(NCIS) as follows: \n \nAt some point, [she] started to try to push me out of the bed with her leg. \nShe was lying on her side as she was trying to push me out of the bed. She \nwas not able to get me out of the bed, but she kept on saying things to me \nto hurt me, belittle me, and make me mad. [She] was lying face down on \nher stomach, and I got on top of her to hold her down by lying on her with \nmy body. I was trying to stop her from continuing to say things to me so I \ngrabbed her with my hands by her face and head. I kept telling her to shut \nup. [She] was struggling the whole time. I did not twist or turn [her] by her \nhead. I am sure she got the mark on her face when I was holding her by the \nhead, but I do not know how she got the other marks, shown [in the photos]. \n. . . I knew she was going to call security, so I unplugged the phone from \nthe wall. (GE 6 at 9-10)  \n \nApplicant admitted that he laid on top of his spouse and grabbed her face hard \nenough to leave marks on her skin. (See SOR response to \u00b6 3.a at 5 (admitting to mutual \nphysical contacts and unhealthy marital conflicts) The NCIS report of investigation \nindicates Applicant and his spouse engaged in a physical altercation, and they both \nsustained bruises. (GE 6) Applicant admitting pinning his spouse to the bed and grabbing \nher by the face and head. She had \u201cbruises and abrasions to her chest, shoulder, and \nface.\u201d (GE 6 at 2, 5) Applicant had \u201ca small injury\u201d to his neck and thumb. (AE 6 at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s commander ordered him to move out of base housing until further notice. (AE \n6 at 5) Applicant told NCIS that there were two prior incidents involving the police, one \ninvolving pushing in 2004, and one involving a verbal argument (no physical contact) in \n2006. (AE 6 at 5, 11) No adverse inference is drawn from the incident in 2006. He received \nmarital counseling. (SOR response at 5-6) He was not convicted of a crime. (SOR \nresponse at 5; GE 6) Applicant was unable to remember or unwilling to disclose details of \nthe June 2007 altercation with his spouse at his hearing. (Tr. 30, 54) \n \nOn July 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the domestic violence allegations in the \nSOR. Applicant said, \u201c[a]fter going to counseling and working together as a team, my wife \nand I came out strong and closer than ever before. We have found healthy ways to handle \nconflict, so I can say with utmost confidence that the behaviors from the past will not recur.\u201d \n(Tr. 54-56; SOR response at 6) \n\n \n6                                        \n \n \nIn August 2019, Applicant was upset with his spouse because he believed she was \nhaving an extramarital affair. (Tr. 32-33) Applicant and his spouse argued for several \nhours. (Unless another citation is indicated, the information in this paragraph is from a \npolice report, GE 5 at 4, 6-9) They engaged in mutual shoving. (Tr. 67) She took a photo \nalbum into the kitchen and began burning photographs. (Tr. 67) His spouse said Applicant \npulled her hair, pushed her into the sink, grabbed her crotch, and made negative \ncomments about her crotch. (Id. at 4, 6) Applicant said he could have pulled her hair; \nhowever, he did not remember pulling her hair. (Tr. 67-68) She responded by calling the \npolice. Applicant admitted the mutual pushing, and that he pushed her away from the stove \nbecause she was trying to burn photos of his deceased father. (Id. at 4)  \n \nThe police arrested Applicant for the August 2019 altercation, and Applicant was \ncharged with assault and battery. (Id. at 4, 9) Applicant told the magistrate \u201che pushed her \nby the stove, and also that he may have pulled her hair.\u201d (Id. at 4) The disposition \ninformation relating to Applicant\u2019s assault and battery charge is not part of the record. \nApplicant said he did not understand whether the court proceeding included a plea of \nguilty. (Tr. 57, 64) On December 2, 2019, Applicant paid $450 to enable him to begin a \ncourt-ordered 18-week domestic violence course. (Tr. 33-34, 57-58; AE K) Applicant said \nhe started the course. (Tr. 34) Applicant said he will be on probation until October 2020. \n(Tr. 58) He might be able to have the charges dismissed. (Tr. 66) \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nApplicant is currently unemployed, and he was unemployed from July 2017, to \nJanuary 2018, and from June 2006, to August 2007. (Tr. 28, 44-45; GE 1; GE 2 at 3) \nApplicant said he was unable to pay some of his debts because of unemployment. (Tr. 35-\n36) He has a 70 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Tr. 29) \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling $34,013 as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 4.a alleges Applicant has a charged-off credit-card debt for $20,140. \nApplicant\u2019s June 27, 2019 Equifax credit report indicates this debt was $5,879 past due, \nand was reported delinquent in May 2017. (AE D at 21) On November 15, 2019, the \ncreditor wrote the debt was settled for $12,175, and the debt is resolved.

(AE D at 24-25) He had multiple \naccounts in \u201cpays as agreed status,\u201d including a mortgage for about $696,000. (AE D at \n33-35) In July 2019, Applicant received financial counseling and generated a budget.

(AE E at 3-4; AE S at 3-4) According to his budget, his spouse pays part of the \nmortgage. (AE E at 3-4; AE S at 3-4) Applicant said he withdrew $50,000 from his Thrift \nSavings Plan account and used the funds to pay all of his delinquent debts.

Although \nNigeria\u2019s economy has become more diversified, crude oil sales have continued to be the \nmain source of export earnings and government revenues. Despite persistent structural \nweaknesses such as a deficient transportation infrastructure, the Nigerian economy grew \nbriskly for the decade ending in 2013. The growth rate slowed in 2014, owing in large part \nto the fall in oil prices, and in 2016 and 2017 Nigeria experienced its first recession in over \ntwo decades before rebounding in 2018. The gains from economic growth have been \nuneven; more than 60% of the population lives in poverty. \n \nThe United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, with U.S. foreign direct \ninvestment concentrated largely in the petroleum/mining and wholesale trade sectors. At \n$2.2 billion in 2017, Nigeria is the second largest U.S. export destination in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The United States and Nigeria have a bilateral trade and investment framework \nagreement. In 2017, the two-way trade in goods between the United States and Nigeria \ntotaled over $9 billion. . . .  Nigeria and the United States belong to a number of the same \ninternational organizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, \n\n \n8                                        \n \n \nWorld Bank, and World Trade Organization. Nigeria also is an observer to the \nOrganization of American States. \n \nNigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states and the Federal Capital \nTerritory. In 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress party \nwas elected to a four-year term in the first successful democratic transfer of power from \na sitting president in the country\u2019s history. In February 2019, he was re-elected for a \nsecond term. Notwithstanding important steps forward on consolidating democracy, \nNigeria continues to face the formidable challenges of terrorist attacks, inter-communal \nconflicts, crime, kidnapping, and public mistrust of the government.  \n \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Nigeria is Level 3: Reconsider \nTravel due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and maritime crimes; and \nLevel 4: Do Not Travel to Borno and Yobe States and Northern Adamawa State due to \nterrorism. (emphasis in original) The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to provide \nemergency services to U.S. citizens beyond Abuja and Lagos and their immediate \nsurrounding areas. U.S. Government employees are subject to movement constraints as \nsecurity conditions warrant. Both Abuja and Lagos are assessed by the Department of \nState as being high-threat locations for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. \nGovernment interests. U.S. Government personnel are currently prohibited from traveling \nto Borno due to terrorist threats against United States and European citizens located in \nBorno. \n \nBoko Haram, and ISIS-West Africa, both of which are designated Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations, are active in Nigeria. Boko Haram seeks to replace the Nigerian \ngovernment with an Islamic state, establish an Islamic caliphate across Africa, avenge \nmilitary offenses against the group, and destroy any political or social activity associated \nwith Western society. It conducts attacks primarily on civilian and regional military targets. \nISIS-West Africa also seek to implement its strict interpretation of Sharia and replace the \nNigerian government with an Islamic state. \n \nBoko Haram and ISIS-West Africa continued to conduct attacks against \ngovernment and security forces in the northeast, which resulted in deaths, injuries, \nabductions, and the capture and destruction of property. Boko Haram attacks did not \nappear to discriminate between civilians and government officials, whereas ISIS-West \nAfrica tended to generally focus on government and security forces, while trying to \ncultivate stronger ties with local communities, including by providing limited social \nservices. The Nigerian military has expanded its presence in parts of northeastern \nNigeria, but the northeast remains an active zone of combat, as Boko Haram and ISIS-\nWest Africa insurgents continue to carry out attacks. \n \nWhile Boko Haram no longer controls as much territory as it once did, the two \ninsurgencies nevertheless maintain the ability to stage forces in rural areas and launch \nattacks against civilian and military targets across the northeast. Boko Haram continued \nto employ indiscriminate suicide bombings targeting the local civilian populations. ISIS-\nWest Africa targeted civilians with attacks and kidnappings less frequently than Boko \nHaram, but employed targeted acts of violence and intimidation against civilians in order \n\n \n9                                        \n \n \nto expand its area of influence and gain control over critical economic resources. As part \nof a violent and deliberate campaign, ISIS-West Africa also targeted government figures, \ntraditional leaders, and contractors. Both groups have carried out more than 600 to 700 \nattacks in Nigeria using small arms, captured military equipment, suicide bombers, \nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs), vehicle-borne (VB) IEDs, ambushes, and \nkidnappings.  \n \nIn 2018, Boko Haram recruited and forcefully conscripted child soldiers, and it \ncarried out scores of suicide bombings, many by young women and girls forced into \nservice. The group conducted abductions and subjected many abducted women and girls \nto sexual and gender-based violence, including forced marriage and rape. The Nigerian \ngovernment investigated attacks by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa and took steps to \nprosecute their members, although the majority of suspected insurgent group supporters \nwere held in military custody without charge. \n \nOther human rights issues reported in Nigeria during 2018 included unlawful and \narbitrary killings, forced disappearances, and torture by both government and non-state \nactors; prolonged arbitrary detention in life-threatening conditions, particularly in \ngovernment detention facilities; harsh and life-threatening civilian detentions in military \nfacilities, often based on flimsy or no evidence; and infringement on citizens\u2019 privacy \nrights. The government took steps to investigate alleged abuses but fewer steps to \nprosecute officials who committed violations. Impunity remained widespread at all levels \nof government.     \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n10                                        \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n\n \n11                                        \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and three siblings are citizens of Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s mother \nlives with Applicant in the United States. Applicant\u2019s three siblings are residents of \nNigeria. Applicant has frequent contacts with his siblings.  \n  \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Nigeria primarily \nbecause of terrorists and criminals. Terrorists have killed hundreds of Nigerians in the last \nfive years. The Nigerian government has made progress against the terrorists in recent \nyears; however, terrorism continues to be a serious problem. \n\n \n12                                        \n \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a foreign country \nis not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his \nor her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (reversing \ngrant of security clearance because of problematic annual visits of applicant\u2019s father to \nIran and ownership of property in Germany).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002)). \n    \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government are \namong the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-\n02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). \nAnother important factor is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with the \nUnited States. These elements are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion or \ninducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence-collection operations against the United States. The terrorism situation in \nNigeria places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with any family member living in or visiting Nigeria does not pose a security \nrisk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and concerns about assisting a relative living in or \nvisiting Nigeria.  \n \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 \nn. 18 (App. Bd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country raise a security \nconcern: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on \ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an \napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign \ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a \n\n \n13                                        \n \n \npotential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to exploit in an effort \nto get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an applicant  \n-- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, \nor through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile \nto the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at \n5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical \nfields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. \n27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing \nTaiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in Nigeria seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Nigeria has a significant problem \nwith terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in that country \u201ccould be a means through \nwhich Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology \nand who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Nigeria or visiting that \ncountry create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on \nhis family in Nigeria in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. \nThese relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence \nof Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Nigeria and has raised the issue of potential \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, and further \ninquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n\n \n14                                        \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Nigeria, and she is a lawful permanent resident of \nthe United States. She lives with Applicant in the United States. His siblings are citizens \nand residents of Nigeria. Applicant assured his siblings have no connection to the Nigerian \ngovernment. Applicant has frequent contacts with his mother and siblings. Applicant most \nrecently went to Nigeria in 2016 for his father\u2019s funeral. AG \u00b6 8(a) cannot reasonably apply \nbecause of the closeness of his ties to family members with Nigerian citizenship or \nresidency or both. \n \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant connections to the United \nStates. He was born in the United States. He lived in the United States for the last 25 \nyears. He honorably served in the U.S. Navy for eight years, and he was a U.S. \nGovernment employee for more than 10 years. He is married to a U.S. citizen who is also \na veteran, having served in the U.S. Navy for several years. Applicant and his spouse own \na home in the United States, and he has bank accounts and credit cards in the United \nStates. His child is a U.S. citizen and resident of the United States. There is no evidence \nof ongoing financial connections to Nigeria. Applicant has shown his patriotism, loyalty, \nand fidelity to the United States during his support to DOD while serving in the Navy and \nduring his federal civilian employment.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Nigeria or that have significant contacts with residents of Nigeria. \nApplicant has close relationships with family in that country, and they are at risk from \ncriminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of the Nigeria government.  \n\n \n15                                        \n \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to the United States are much more significant \nthan his and his mother\u2019s connections to their relatives living in Nigeria. Applicant \u201chas \nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that [he] can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b) \napplies. Foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nForeign Preference \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the security concern about foreign preference stating: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying including, \u201c(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the \nU.S.\u201d The SOR alleges that Applicant used his Nigerian passport in lieu of his United \nStates passport to exit and enter the United States in about December 2011, May 2015, \nand August 2016, and he intends to continue using his Nigerian passport in lieu of his \nUnited States passport to exit and enter the United States. Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations. At his hearing, he said he presented both passports when he entered the \nUnited States. \n \nIf Applicant solely used his Nigerian passport to enter the United States, he would \nhave needed a U.S. visa. \u201cAll travelers entering the United States from all other countries \nneed a passport upon arrival (regardless of their country of citizenship). Permanent \nresidents and foreign nationals may also need a U.S. visa. You must apply for a visa \nbefore you start your trip.\u201d U.S. Government website, https://www.usa.gov/enter-us.    \n \n\u201cU.S. citizens don\u2019t need a U.S. visa for travel, but when planning travel abroad \nmay need a visa issued by the embassy of the country they wish to visit.\u201d See Department \nof State website, https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html. Applicant had a \nU.S. passport and a Nigerian passport. He apparently used his Nigerian passport so that \nhe would not need a visa issued by Nigeria when he visited Nigeria. He did not explain \nwhy he would present a Nigerian passport when entering and exiting the United States. \nBecause Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, the government\u2019s evidence meets the \nsubstantial evidence test, and consideration of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n\n \n16                                        \n \n \nAG \u00b6 11 states conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case \nincluding, \u201c(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests\u201d; and \u201c(e) the exercise of \nthe entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do not present a national security \nconcern.\u201d \n \nAssuming Applicant used his Nigerian passport to enter or exit the United States, \nApplicant said he is willing to renounce his Nigerian citizenship if necessary to alleviate \nsecurity concerns. He most recently used his Nigerian passport in 2016, and he was \nunaware that use of his Nigerian passport might cause a security concern. He said he is \nwilling to turn-in his Nigerian passport or not use it to enter or exit the United States to \ncomply with security requirements. His past use of a Nigerian passport under these \ncircumstances does not show a preference for Nigeria. AG \u00b6 11(c) applies, and AG \u00b6 \n11(e) partially applies. Foreign preference security concerns are mitigated.  \n  \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \n15. The Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure \nto cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations; and \n \n\n \n17                                        \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant engaged in physical altercations with his spouse in 2004, 2007, and \nAugust 2019. Applicant was charged as a result of the August 2019 altercation with \nassault and battery, a criminal offense that could have been alleged under Guideline J. \nThe 2007 incident occurred outside the United States and may not have been a criminal \noffense under foreign law. The facts involved in the 2004 incident are unclear. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s pattern of engaging in domestic altercations with his spouse, \nespecially the most recent altercation, show questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules. Such conduct adversely affects his \nprofessional and community standing.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n\n \n18                                        \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s August 2019 altercation \nwith his spouse resulted in his arrest for assault and battery. This altercation occurred \nafter he responded to the SOR and indicated future domestic violence incidents would \nnot occur. He is on probation and has not completed domestic violence counseling. He \nhas not completed the rehabilitation process. Future inappropriate behavior is likely to \noccur. His behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c).  \n \n \n \n\n \n19                                        \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-\n01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n\n \n20                                        \n \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \nApplicant was unemployed, which is a circumstance outside of his control that \nadversely affected his finances. He showed his good faith by resolving all of the SOR \ndebts. His credit reports reflect that he has paid many debts on terms acceptable to his \ncreditors. There is sufficient assurance his financial problems are resolved, under control, \nand will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, he established that financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines B, C, \nE, and F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old health support specialist. He was born in the United \nStates. He lived in Nigeria from age 2 to 20. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1998 to \n2006. He received an honorable discharge as a petty officer third class. During his Navy \nservice, he received the following awards: Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal; \nMeritorious Unit Commendation (2); National Defense Service Medal; Navy Good Conduct \nMedal (2); and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. After leaving the Navy, Applicant \nworked for the federal government for almost 11 years (2007 to 2017) in the field of health \ncare. At the time he left federal civil service employment, he was a GS 14 Public Health \nAnalyst. In 2003, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in healthcare services, and in 2006, he \nreceived a dual master\u2019s degree in healthcare administration and business administration. \nHe is working towards a Ph.D. in healthcare services. Applicant married in 2003. His \nspouse and child are U.S. citizens.   \n \nIn 2019, Applicant received an excellent annual performance evaluation. Five co-\nworkers and/or friends provided letters supporting Applicant\u2019s access to classified \n\n \n21                                        \n \n \ninformation. The general sense of their letters is that Applicant is trustworthy, professional, \ndiligent, highly motivated, an exceptional leader, helpful, intelligent, and innovative. \nApplicant provides important contributions to mission accomplishment. The letters did not \nindicate his character references were aware of the contents of the SOR. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Nigeria must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers in those countries. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical \nsituation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Nigeria is a dangerous \nplace because of violence from terrorists and criminals, and the Nigeria government does \nnot respect the full spectrum of human rights. Terrorists continue to threaten the interests \nof the United States and those who cooperate and assist the United States.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Nigerian family has no connection to the Nigerian government or \nterrorists. See ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) (reversing grant of \nsecurity clearance because of connections to Nigerian government). While the \ngovernment has no obligation to present evidence of such a connection, such evidence \nhas important security implications. Id. Applicant has not visited Nigeria since his father\u2019s \ndeath in 2016. He has strong connections to the United States: 25 years residence in the \nUnited States; property in the United States; spouse, child, and mother reside in the \nUnited States; Applicant, spouse, and child are U.S. citizens; spouse is not a citizen of \nNigeria; eight years of honorable active duty Navy service; and more than 10 years of \nfederal government civilian service. \n \nThe three domestic disturbances in 2004, 2007, and 2019 involving Applicant and \nhis spouse provide persuasive evidence that access to classified information is not \nwarranted at this time. Applicant was most recently arrested in August 2019 for assault \nand battery upon his spouse. He previously promised in his SOR response that such \naltercations would not recur. He is currently on probation. He has enrolled in, but not \ncompleted counseling. His domestic violence incidents constitute \u201c[c]onduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules,\u201d \nand this conduct raises unresolved questions about his \u201creliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d AG \u00b6 15. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

(Government Exhibit 1.)  On May 2, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \ndetailing \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF, \nFinancial \nConsiderations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 3, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 4, 2019.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing November 6, 2019, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 4, 2019.  The Government \noffered nine exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered eight exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \ncalled three witnesses and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on December 17, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 47 years old, divorced and is living with his ex-girlfriend.  He has two \nchildren from a previous marriage.  He has a high school diploma and six months of \ncollege.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Welder.  He is seeking to obtain \na security clearance in connection with his employment.    \n \n \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  \n \n \nThe SOR identified seven delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,184, \nshowing a history of financial problems.  Applicant admits each of the allegations set \nforth in the SOR under this guideline.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated November 3, \n2017; and January 9, 2019, confirm the outstanding debts.  (Government Exhibits 8 and \n9.)  Applicant began working for his current employer in 2017.           \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant was convicted of Attempted Murder and was sentenced to \nthirteen years in Federal prison.  He served 85% of his sentence, and was released for \ngood time served in 2007.  While in prison, Applicant took welding classes, and from \n1999 to 2004, worked as a prison welder earning minimum wages.  These monies were \nsent to his ex-wife to pay for child support.  Upon his release from prison, Applicant was \nplaced on parole for three years.  About six months after being released from prison, \nApplicant met his 11 year old daughter for the first time since her birth.  With her coming \ninto his life, he spent money to help her with school supplies and other things she \nneeded.  In addition, because the Applicant had good credit, he was solicited by \ncreditors who sent him credit cards.  He took advantage of this situation.  He also \npurchased a car for his son, who was 4 years old when Applicant went to prison, and \nwas 15 years old when Applicant was released.  In 2012, Applicant suffered a heart \nattack which caused his employer to eliminate his overtime hours and ultimately \nreduced his income.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)  As a result, Applicant accumulated debt \nthat he could not afford to pay.    \n \n \nApplicant and his girlfriend inherited a house from a sick and elderly man that \nthey took care of before he died.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)  Accordingly to the Applicant, \nthe deed to the house was placed in the Applicant and his girlfriend\u2019s name, the house \nis paid off, and has equity of about $450,000.  (Tr. p. 95.)  Applicant hopes to obtain a \nloan against the house in order to pay off his delinquent debts.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  \n\n \n3 \n \nSince the man had no will or trust, the house must go through probate and Applicant \nhas not been able to leverage it to obtain a loan. \n \n \n1.a.  A delinquent auto loan was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$11,672.  Applicant explained that he contacted the creditor and told them that he could \nno longer make the monthly payments of $550.  He gave the car back to the creditor, \nthey sold it at auction and Applicant owes the deficiency amount of $11,672.  In June or \nJuly 2019, Applicant made two payments of $200 each toward the debt but the creditor \nwanted a larger payment, and so he stopped the payments.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E, and \nTr. pp. 66-68.)     \n \n \n1.b.  A delinquent credit card debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $6,145.  Applicant contacted the creditor to make monthly payments of $50 \nmonthly, but the creditor would not accept such a low payment.  Thus, the debt remains \nowing.  (Tr. p. 72.) \n          \n \n1.c.  A delinquent credit card debt was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$5,042.  Applicant started making payments of $100 monthly which increased to $200 \nmonthly.  Applicant has reduced the debt to about $3,992.37.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D, \nand Tr. pp. 74-75.)    \n \n1.d.  A delinquent credit card debt was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$3,433.  Applicant allowed his ex-wife to use his credit card to take their son on vacation \nand other things, and she did not pay the bill.  Applicant realizes that it is his \nresponsibility, but has not paid it yet.  Applicant offered to pay the creditor $50 monthly, \nbut the creditor rejected the offer.  Applicant plans to pay it when he gets a loan against \nthe house he inherited.  (Tr. p.p. 76-77.) \n \n1.e.  A delinquent credit card debt was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$1,827.  Applicant does not know for sure if it has been paid or not.  (Tr. p. 78.)  He \noffered to pay the creditor $50 monthly, but the offer was rejected by the creditor.  \nApplicant stated that he is in the process of getting a loan against the house he \ninherited to pay off this debt.  (Tr. p. 79.)           \n \n1.f.  A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $440.  \nApplicant is not sure whether he has paid the debt yet.  He offered to pay the creditor \n$50 monthly but the offer was rejected by the creditor.  Applicant intends on paying the \ndebt when he gets the loan against the house he inherited.  (Tr. pp. 79- 82) \n \n1.g.  A delinquent debt owed to an electronics store was past due in in the \napproximate amount of $1,625.    Applicant has not yet paid the debt, but intends on \ndoing so when he gets the loan against the house he inherited.  (Tr. p. 87.) \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \n\n \n4 \n \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant was charged with Attempted Murder, Aggravated Mayhem, \nTorture, two counts of Kidnapping and Assault with a Deadly Weapon.  Applicant was \nconvicted of Attempted Murder and sentenced to thirteen years in prison.  (Government \nExhibit 7.)    \n \n \nApplicant currently resides with his girlfriend in the house that they both inherited.  \nApplicant broke up with his girlfriend.  In about July 2018, she moved her new boyfriend, \nand some of her other friends into the house to live.  Applicant explained that on this \noccasion they were partying, and he was upset because they were not helping to pay \nany of the household bills.  Applicant got into an argument with his ex-girlfriend.  He \nstated that he started to work on some of the construction that was already in progress, \nnamely hit the wall which caused a mirror to fall and break, and threw a bookshelf.  At \nthat time, a fight ensued and the police were called.  The police saw blood on the floor.  \nApplicant was arrested.   On October 5, 2018, Applicant was charged with one count of \nBattery, against his ex-girlfriend, and one count of vandalism, against his other \ngirlfriend.  On October 9, 2018, the charges were dropped.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and \nB, and Government Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.) \n \n \nThree witnesses testified favorably on behalf of the Applicant, including his direct \nsupervisor, the shop foreman, and a coworker.  They all consider the Applicant to be \nhonest, reliable and trustworthy.  They have witnessed his outstanding work product, \ngood character and consider him to be an asset to the team.  They all hold security \nclearances and highly recommend him for one.  They are aware of his past misconduct \nand why he is before this administrative judge.  (Tr.  p. 21 \u2013 37.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n\n \n6 \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts that he could not pay.  The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each one of them set forth below:    \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not yet obtained the loan against his house that he plans to use to \npay his debts.  Except for one debt, the others remain owing.  He has not demonstrated \nthat his financial problems have been resolved, or are being resolved, or that they are \nunlikely to recur.  The mitigating conditions do not apply.  Accordingly, this guideline is \nfound for against Applicant.   \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \n(1) Untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; and \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nIt is noted that Applicant\u2019s conviction for Attempted Murder occurred over twenty-\nfour years ago.  Since then, he has obviously worked hard to get his life back in order. \nHe is commended for his progress.  However, despite this progress, Applicant has \ncontinued to make some poor decisions that have adversely impacted his ability to \nobtain a security clearance.  As recently as July 2018, Applicant was involved in a \nserious domestic altercation where the police were called to the home, and he was \narrested for Battery and Vandalism.  Although the matter was ultimately dismissed, \nincidents of this sort can never ever be affiliated with the Applicant.  His overall \ncharacter and conduct must consistently show pristine honesty, integrity, good judgment \nand reliability.  Applicant\u2019s recent misconduct indicates questionable judgment, \nunreliability, and untrustworthiness, characteristics of an individual who does not meet \nthe qualifications for access to classified information.  None of mitigating conditions are \napplicable.  Accordingly, this guideline is found against the Applicant.   \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n\n \n9 \n \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is a 47 year-old \nman who has served eleven years in prison and who is now trying to put his life back \ntogether.  He is currently working in the defense industry and would like the privilege of \nholding a security clearance.  He is recognized for the achievements he has made, but \nmuch more work is needed.  He must continue to mature and show the level of good \njudgment and responsibility required of an individual who is trusted with the national \nsecrets.  In 2018, just two years ago, Applicant was involved with police encounters \nwherein he was arrested for Battery and Vandalism upon his ex-girlfriends, one with \nwhom he still resides.  At this time, Applicant has not demonstrated that he can be \ntrusted with the national secrets.   This is not an individual with whom the Government \ncan be confident to know that he will always follow rules and regulations, and do the \nright thing, even when no one is looking.  He is not qualified for access to classified \ninformation, nor is it clear that the information will be properly protected.  Applicant does \nnot meet the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations and Personal \nConduct security concerns.    \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.k., 1.p., and 1.q., which she denied. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 and 11.) She has been employed with the defense contractor since November of 2016. (GX 1 at page 11.) She is married, but has no children.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 7, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 13, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non September16, 2019, scheduling the hearing for October 8, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 6, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered two \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and B. The record was left \nopen until November 15, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. On November \n\n \n2 \n \n13, 2019, Applicant offered additional documentation, which are marked as Post-\nHearing Exhibits (PHXs) A~Q, and admitted into evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on October 17, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.k., 1.p., and 1.q., \nwhich she denied. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 11.) She has been employed with the defense contractor since November of 2016. \n(GX 1 at page 11.) She is married, but has no children. (TR at page 20 line 9 to page 22 \nline 12, and GX 1 at pages 22~28.) Applicant attributes her current financial difficulties \nto periods of unemployment, and health issues for both herself and her husband. (TR at \npage 22 line 13 to page 25 line 25.) She is well respect at work. (PHX Q.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.m. In January of 2015, Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy. (TR at page 26 lines 1~25,  at page 38 lines 1~5, and GX 2.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that she is indebted to Creditor A for a past-due debt of \nabout $9,707. (TR at page 21 lines 1~25.) Applicant has submitted documentation \nshowing she has contacted Creditor A about setting up a payment plan to address this \nadmitted past-due debt, but little else. (PHX A.) This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor B for a past-due debt of \nabout $1,724. (TR at page 28 line 12 to page 30 line 18.) Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation showing she has paid this admitted past-due debt with a \u201czero balance.\u201d \n(AppX A.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor C for a past-due debt of \nabout $1,412. (TR at page 30 line 19 to page 31 line 14.) Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation showing she is making monthly payments of $143 towards this admitted \npast-due debt. (AppX B, and PHX C.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor D for a past-due debt of \nabout $1,196. (TR at page 31 line 15 to page 32 line 20.) Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation showing she is making monthly payments of $209 towards this admitted \npast-due debt. (PHX D.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admits that she is indebted to Creditor E for a past-due debt of \nabout $1,114. (TR at page 32 line 21 to page 33 line 11.) Applicant has submitted \nnothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admits that she is indebted to Creditor F for a past-due debt of \nabout $1,025. (TR at page 33 line 22 to page 34 line 21.) Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation showing she has contacted Creditor F about setting up a payment plan \nto address this admitted past-due debt, but little else. (PHX F.) This allegation is found \nagainst Applicant. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor G for a past-due debt of \nabout $895. (TR at page 34 line 15 to page 35 line 12.) Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation showing she is making monthly payments of $50 towards this admitted \npast-due debt. (PHX G.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.h. and 1.j. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor H for past-due \ndebts totaling about $940. (TR at page 35 line 13 to page 36 line 13.) Applicant has \nsubmitted documentation showing she is making monthly payments of $51 towards \nthese admitted past-due debts. (PHX G and J.) These allegations are found for \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor J for a past-due debt of \nabout $714. (TR at page 36 line 14 to page 37 line 2.) Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation showing she is making monthly payments of $137 towards this admitted \npast-due debt. (PHX J.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.k. Applicant denies that she is indebted to Creditor K for a past-due debt of \nabout $162. (TR at page 37 lines 3~12.) As this alleged past-due debt does not appear \non any of the Government\u2019s credit reports, this allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.l. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor L for a past-due debt of \nabout $140. (TR at page 37 lines 13~25.) Applicant has submitted documentation \nshowing she has authorized two $50 payments in settlement of this past-due debt. \n(PHX L.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.m. The Chapter 7 Bankruptcy has already been discussed, above. \n \n \n1.n. Applicant admits that she is indebted to Creditor N for a past-due debt of \nabout $583. (TR at page 38 lines 6~25.) Applicant has submitted nothing further in this \nregard. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.o. Applicant admits that she is indebted to Creditor O for a past-due debt of \nabout $523. (TR at page 39 line 1 to page 40 line 18.) Applicant has submitted nothing \nfurther in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.p. Applicant initially denied that she was indebted to Creditor P for a past-due \ndebt of about $208. (TR at page 40 lines 19~24.) Applicant has now submitted \ndocumentation showing she has authorized payments to resolve this past-due debt. \n(PHX P.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1.q. Applicant denies that she is indebted to Creditor Q for a past-due debt of \nabout $124. (TR at page 41 lines 1~7.) As this alleged past-due debt does not appear \non any of the Government\u2019s credit reports, this allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. She has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Although Applicant has made an effort to address much of her past-due \nindebtedness, she still has in excess of $12,000 of past-due indebtedness. \nFurthermore, she has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. The Financial Considerations \nguideline is found against Applicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant performs well and is \nrespected in the workplace. However, overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b.~1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e. and 1.f.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g.~1.l.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.o.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p.~1.q.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He made multiple deliberately false statements about \nhis background during the security clearance process. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non December 5, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on March 12, 2019, after reviewing the application \nand the information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \n\n \n2 \n \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline E for personal conduct \n(falsification). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 3, 2019. He provided a four-page \nmemorandum in which he admitted four of the seven falsification allegations. He \nprovided explanations for the three allegations he did not admit.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on August 9, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on September 26, 2019. Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, \nwhich were admitted as Exhibits 1-3. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which \nwere admitted as Exhibits A-H. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 11, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee who is seeking access to classified \ninformation pursuant to a job offer from a federal contractor to work as a linguist. He is \ncurrently employed in the insurance industry. His employment history includes \nhonorable military service. (Exhibits A and B) He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ninternational business in August 2018. (Exhibit C). He has never married and has no \nchildren.   \n \nApplicant described himself as a \u201cwar baby,\u201d his parents are natives of Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, he was born in Germany where his mother and an older brother had fled \nas refugees, and his father joined them later. (Tr. 32-34) The family immigrated to the \nUnited States in 1999. His father is now deceased. He completed high school in 2011 \nand enlisted in the Army National Guard that same year because he felt an obligation to \nserve his adopted country.   \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits making multiple deliberately false \nstatements about his background during the security clearance process. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.f, and 1.g). Each is discussed briefly below.  \n \nFirst, Applicant made a false statement about his employment history on his \n2017 security clearance application when he omitted that he had been disciplined by the \nArmy National Guard after he tested positive for marijuana in March 2014. The \ndiscipline consisted of a counseling session from his first sergeant, being placed into a \nnon-promotable status, attendance at a drug-counseling session, and completion of an \nonline drug course. (Tr. 35-37) He was not disciplined under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ).  \n \nSecond, Applicant made a false and misleading statement about his employment \nhistory on his security clearance application when he omitted he had been terminated \nfrom a part-time job as a sales coordinator for a hotel. Instead, he stated on his security \nclearance application that he left the job due to a conflict of interest in that he was \ndating his supervisor. He was terminated or fired due to theft of two complimentary \ntickets for a college basketball game.   \n\n \n3 \n \nThird, Applicant made a false statement during a December 2017 background \ninvestigation interview when he omitted testing positive for marijuana during his service \nwith the Army National Guard. He was asked several times if there was any adverse \nevent he could recall. Only when specifically confronted about the 2014 positive drug \ntest did he admit it.    \n \nFourth, Applicant made a false statement during a December 2017 background \ninvestigation interview when he denied or could not recall that he may have been \nterminated or fired from his employment with the hotel in 2014. Only when specifically \nconfronted about his termination for theft of the basketball tickets did he admit to the \nincident, which he did not consider serious or significant due to the low value of the \ntickets. \n \nApplicant denied the falsification allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. The \nthree matters are discussed briefly below. \n \nFirst, Applicant made a false statement about his employment history on his \nsecurity clearance application when he denied leaving the job at the hotel due to any of \nthe following events: (1) fired; (2) quit after being told you would be fired; (3) left by \nmutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct; or (4) left by mutual \nagreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. As discussed above, he left \nthis job when he was fired for theft of the basketball tickets. His convoluted explanation \nthat his answer to the question was not deliberately false is not credible. \n \nSecond, Applicant did not make a false statement about his history of drug use \non his security clearance application when he disclosed the single use of marijuana, but \nprovided an incorrect date of 2012 instead of the correct date of 2014. Accordingly, his \nfailure to list the 2014 date on his security clearance application was not a deliberately \nfalse statement.  \n \nThird, Applicant made a false statement about his history of drug use on his \nsecurity clearance when he denied ever being ordered, advised, or asked to seeking \ncounseling or treatment as a result of using illegal drugs or controlled substances. He \nanswered the question in the negative and did not disclose the counseling session \nrequired by the Army National Guard in 2014. He explained that since he was not \nrequired to attend a rehabilitation program or a hospital, he felt the counseling required \nby the Army National Guard did not pertain to this question. Applicant\u2019s explanation is \nnot credible.    \n  \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n4 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, the following disqualifying conditions apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n\n \n5 \n \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative.  \n \n \nAs set forth in the findings of fact, Applicant made multiple deliberately false \nstatements during the security clearance process. He omitted derogatory information \nabout his background when he completed his security clearance application, and he \nwas less than candid during his background investigation.  \n \n \nIn mitigation, I have considered all the favorable information Applicant presented, \nincluding Exhibits A-H. I specifically note the numerous favorable letters of \nrecommendation. I have also considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, and \nnone apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. Making deliberately false statements during the security \nclearance process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily explained away, excused, \nor otherwise mitigated. Based on the record, Applicant\u2019s misconduct is far too serious to \nbe mitigated.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I gave particular \nconsideration to his honorable military service. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Scholtes, Esq. \n06/18/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to revoke his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant has a history \nof marijuana use to include drug use after being granted access to classified \ninformation. He also has a history of deliberately making false statements to the \ngovernment about his history of marijuana use. He failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his misconduct. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nActing under under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as \namended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal \nconduct guidelines on March 26, 2019. DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and \nrecommended that the case be submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) administrative judge for a determination whether to deny his security clearance.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and a decision on the written record. On \nApril 18, 2019, Department Counsel requested a hearing under \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the \nAdditional Procedural Guidance of the Directive and sent Applicant a letter informing \nhim of the request. At the hearing, convened on August 28, 2019, I admitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, without objection. I also admitted the discovery \nletter as Hearing Exhibit 1. Applicant testified at the hearing, as did his wife. After the \nhearing, Applicant timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were \nadmitted without objection. The cover letter is appended to the record as HE III. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on September 9, 2019.   \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nOn April 19, 2019, the Government served Applicant with three proposed \namendments to the SOR. Applicant did not object. Accordingly, the SOR was amended \nas follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is amended to allege that Applicant used marijuana on various \noccasions between at October 2012 and April 2017 while granted access \nto classified information.  \n \nApplicant admitted this allegation. \n \nThe SOR was further amended to add two allegations under \u00b6 2. Personal \nConduct, as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: Applicant deliberately falsified material facts during a February \n6, 2018 interview with an authorized investigator from the DOD. \nSpecifically, Applicant reported to the investigator that he only used \nmarijuana on two occasions in the preceding seven years in March 2016 \nand April 2017. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: Applicant deliberately falsified material facts in response to \nDOHA interrogatories he signed on February 22, 2019, reporting that he \nonly used marijuana two times, once in March 2016 and once in April \n2017.  \n \n \nApplicant denied both allegations. The proposed amendments and Applicant\u2019s \nanswers are attached to the record as HE II.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 36, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting \ncompany, as a cyber-security expert since April 2019. His current position requires \npublic trust eligibility. He completed his most recent security clearance application in \nFebruary 2017, while employed at his previous job. Applicant was first granted access \nto classified information during his military service between in 2008 and 2012. The SOR \n\n \n3 \n \nin this case arises from Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while having access to classified \ninformation. (GE 1, 4) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant described his history of marijuana use. He stated that \nhe used the drug on six occasions. (Tr. 22) He first used marijuana in high school with \nhis future brother-in-law in 1997. (Tr. 22-23). The second time he used marijuana was \nduring his first year in college in 2001. (Tr. 23)  Applicant testified that his third use of \nmarijuana occurred in 2008, one month before he enlisted in the Army. (Tr. 24-25). \n \nApplicant completed his first security clearance application in January 2008, \nsigning and attesting that all of the disclosures were true. (GE 3) In response to \nquestions seeking information about his illegal drug use in the seven years preceding \nthe application, Applicant reported that he used marijuana on two occasions in January \n2008. (GE 3) In the additional comments section of the question, Applicant indicated \nthat he used marijuana, \u201cjust to try it.\u201d (GE 3) However, during his 2008 subject \ninterview with a background investigator, Applicant denied any prior drug use. At the \nhearing, he claimed that his recruiter advised him to withhold the information. (Tr. 28) \nApplicant eventually admitted prior drug use during a second subject interview, which \noccurred in June 2008. (Tr. 28-29) Applicant admitted that because of the \nmisinformation he disclosed during the first interview, he had difficulty obtaining a \nsecurity clearance. He was eventually granted a SECRET clearance. He testified that \nafter that experience, he understood the prohibition against using marijuana after being \ngranted access to classified information. (Tr. 65) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not use illegal drugs while he served on active duty \nin the Army. There is no evidence in the record to contradict this testimony. After \nseparating from the military, he worked for a federal contracting company at a location \nin Afghanistan. The job required a security clearance. Applicant testified that his fourth \nuse of marijuana occurred in October 2012, while he was home on a two-week \nvacation. (29) He returned to his job in Afghanistan, which ended in April 2013. He \nworked in private industry for another year before accepting a position with a federal \ncontracting company in April 2014, which also required a security clearance. Applicant \ntestified that he used marijuana for the fifth time in March 2016 while on a trip with a \nfamily member. (30-31) He did not report either the 2012 or his 2016 instances of \nmarijuana use to his respective security officers.  \n  \n \nOn the February 2017 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he \n\u201csmoked marijuana a few times in the past seven years.\u201d He listed his first use as \noccurring in October 2012 and his most recent use as being in March 2016. Regarding \nhis intent to use marijuana in the future, Applicant wrote, \u201cI no longer have any desire to \nsmoke [m]arijuana. [I]t really no longer does anything for me.\u201d (GE 1) \n \n \nDuring his subject interview in February 2018, Applicant admitted the he \npurchased and ingested an edible marijuana product in April 2017, while vacationing in \na state where marijuana use is legal. (GE 2) At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he \nknew that the purchase and use of the drug in any form, including edibles, was \nprohibited for security clearance holders. (Tr. 34) He decided to use the drug, because \n\n \n4 \n \nhe thought it would be fun to do so in a state where consumption was legal. (GE 2) \nApplicant then told the background investigator that he did not intend to use marijuana \nagain in the future. During the interview, Applicant also corrected his dates of marijuana \nuse. He explained to the investigator that he was unsure why he listed October 2012 as \nhis first date of use. He reported his first date of marijuana use as March 2016 with a \ndate of last use occurring in April 2017. He did not disclose the April 2017 drug use to \nhis security officer. (GE 2) \n \n \nIn February 2019, Applicant responded to a set of DOHA interrogatories \nregarding his use of illegal drugs. (GE 2) In response to the question, \u201cHave you EVER \nused illegal any drugs or controlled substances? Use includes injection, snorting, \ninhaling, swallowing, experimenting with, or otherwise consuming any drug or controlled \nsubstance.\u201d Applicant responded affirmatively and listed that he used marijuana on two \noccasions, once in March 2016 and again in April 2017. In response to the question \nasking if the February 2018 interview summary prepared by the background investigator \nwas accurate, Applicant indicated that it was not, noting: \n \nThe two instances of marijuana use are accurate as listed, however it \nstates on page 11 that I plan on using marijuana again and that is not \naccurate. Also, my address was misspelled\u2026 \n \nAt the hearing, he claimed that the interview summary contained further inaccuracies, \nbut that he did not correct them when given the opportunity in response to the February \n2019 interrogatories because he was more concerned about the details of his most \nrecent marijuana use. He also explained that he did not intentionally falsify his \ninterrogatory responses regarding the number of times he used marijuana because he \nhad disclosed them previously and considered them to be a part of his adjudicative \nrecord. (Tr. 44-48) \n \nIn response to questions from Department Counsel at the hearing, Applicant \ntestified that his use of marijuana in high school may have been over the course of one \nor two instances, but no more. (Tr. 59) He also admitted that he used marijuana more \nthan once in college. He estimated that he used the drug ten times between 2001 and \nearly 2002. (Tr. 59-60). He confirmed his one-time use in 2008 before entering the \nmilitary (Tr. 61-62). Applicant admitted his 2012 marijuana use while he was on a short \nvacation from his overseas job, and that it was possible he used the drug over the \ncourse of two days, not one as previously reported. (Tr. 66) When asked about the \nconflicting disclosures in the 2017 security clearance application in which he reported \nthat he had used marijuana a few times in the past seven years, but only listed two \ninstances of use, Applicant stated that he understood the concerns raised by the \ninconsistency, but could not explain his choice of wording. (Tr. 68-69) \n \nApplicant testified that his use of marijuana while having a security clearance \nwas a mistake. He reiterated his intent not to use the drug in the future, citing the \nchanges in his life caused by becoming a father in 2018. Applicant\u2019s wife testified at the \nhearing, describing Applicant has trustworthy and reliable. She echoed Applicant\u2019s \nstatements about marijuana use being incompatible with their new roles as parents. \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant submitted two character letters that described him as a reliable and \ntrustworthy professional.  Applicant also testified that since 2015 he has been working in \nthe cybersecurity field. He believes that having a clearance is integral to his success in \nthe field and that would preclude any future marijuana use. (Tr.53-59, 77, 80-94) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (See, AG \u00b6 24.) The record \nestablishes that Applicant has a history of drug use, dating back almost 20 years (1997 \n\u2013 2017). He admitted using marijuana on at least three occasions after being granted \naccess to classified information in 2008. His most recent use occurred in April 2017, two \nmonths after completing his most recent security clearance application in which he \nstated his intent not to use marijuana in the future. Drug involvement and substance \nmisuse disqualifying conditions \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d and \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal \ndrug use while granted access to classified information\u2026,\u201d apply.  \n \nThe favorable information in the record including: Applicant\u2019s lifestyle changes in \nsupport of abstinence, the positive character testimony from his wife, and the two \ncharacter references, do not mitigate the drug involvement concern. Applicant\u2019s illegal \ndrug use is not mitigated by the passage of time and continues to reflect negatively on \nhis ongoing security worthiness. His use of illegal drugs while having a security \nclearance shows a lapse in judgment that cannot be considered minor. He acted in \ndisregard of federal law and of the voluntary fiduciary relationship he entered into with \nthe government when he became a clearance holder. Although he has stated he will not \nuse marijuana in the future, his past actions indicate otherwise. As a result, his promise \nto abstain from marijuana use in the future carries little weight. None of the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug use is also cross-alleged under the personal conduct guideline.  \nHis use of illegal drugs shows questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, which raises concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to safeguard classified information. (See AG \u00b6 15) Personal conduct \nconcerns also stem from Applicant\u2019s statements regarding his history of marijuana use. \nApplicant\u2019s hearing testimony is inconsistent with the disclosures he made on two \nsecurity clearance applications, during two background interviews, in response to \nDOHA interrogatories, and his answer to the SOR. The number of inconsistent \nstatements over the last ten years is sufficient evidence of Applicant\u2019s intent to mislead \nthe government about the extent of his marijuana use. The evidence supports a finding \nthat AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate . . . falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire . . . or form used to conduct investigations . . . [or] determine national \nsecurity eligibility . . .\u201d and \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an . . . investigator . . . involved in making a \nrecommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination,\u201d apply.  \n \nNone of the personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s \nfalsifications are not minor. He has a long history of making false statements to the \n\n \n7 \n \ngovernment that are material to a determination of his security worthiness. Concerns \nabout his judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and honesty are ongoing. Based on the \nrecord, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current security worthiness. In \nreaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nSecurity clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather are predictive \njudgments about a person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and \npresent circumstances. (Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988.) The \nevidence supports a negative whole-person assessment indicating that Applicant lacks \nthe judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of those granted access to \nclassified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.c: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

He did not intentionally falsify a \ngovernment questionnaire as alleged. His request for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on February 15, 2016. (Government Exhibit 1.) On June 26, 2019, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign \nInfluence), C (Foreign Preference), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \n \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, \neffective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nSeptember 24, 2019. The case was assigned to me on September 25, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October \n18, 2019, scheduling the hearing for November 7, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Government also submitted Government Exhibit 4 for \nAdministrative Notice. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He requested the record \nremain open for the submission of additional evidence. He submitted Applicant Exhibits \nA through G in a timely manner, which were all admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 19, 2019. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Republic of the Philippines (the Philippines). Department Counsel \nprovided a five-page summary of the facts, supported by six Government documents \npertaining to the Philippines, identified as Government Exhibit 4. The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the \nfacts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n(Tr. 12-13.) \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, with explanations. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and married, with one child. He is applying for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment with a \ndefense contractor as a hazardous material technician.  \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and  \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline C (Foreign Preference) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in Paragraph 1 of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor clearance because he has foreign contacts or interests that may result in divided \nallegiance. The Government further alleged in Paragraph 2 of the SOR that Applicant is \nineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference for \nanother country over the United States. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was born in the Philippines in 1971. He immigrated to the United \nStates, along with his family, in 1988. Applicant joined the US Navy in 1989. He was \nnaturalized as an American citizen in 1993. Applicant retired from the Navy as a Master \nat Arms First Class (E-6) in 2009. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 9 and 15; Tr. 14-\n15.) \n \n \nApplicant met his wife while stationed in the United States. They were married in \n1994. She is also a naturalized American citizen of Filipino ancestry. Their son was born \nin the United States in 2001, and is about to join the US Navy. Applicant\u2019s wife, son and \nfather, also an American citizen, all currently live in the Philippines. Once his son enlists \nin the Navy, the plan is for Applicant\u2019s wife to join Applicant in the country where he \ncurrently works. Eventually, Applicant and his wife plan to return to the United States as \ntheir primary residence. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 17 and 18; Tr. 15-16.) \n \n \nApplicant and his family moved to the Philippines after his retirement in 2009. \nApplicant reacquired Philippine citizenship in 2009, in expectation of living full-time in \nthe Philippines. He lived in the Philippines with his family until 2015, when he went to \nwork for the Navy as a contractor in another country. When in the Philippines during that \nperiod, Applicant went to school. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 12, Government \nExhibit 2 at 7; Tr. 17-18.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, with minimal help from Applicant, ran a chicken rotisserie stand \nbusiness in the Philippines for about three years. The business closed in 2015 or 2016 \ndue to unprofitability. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 20A; Tr. 18-19.)  \n \n \nWhile living in the Philippines, Applicant and his wife bought a house and some \nland. The house is worth approximately $138,000. The land is worth about $32,000. \nApplicant plans to sell the land, since he and his wife have decided not to build on it. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 20A; Tr. 19-21.) \n \n \nIn connection with the business, and the properties they purchased, Applicant \nand his wife had three bank accounts in the Philippines. None of the accounts had a lot \nof money, and at least one of them has been closed. (Government Exhibit 2 at 8; \nApplicant Exhibits F and G; Tr. 22.) \n \n \nApplicant realized that he would have to renounce his Philippine citizenship when \nhe went back to work with the Navy. To that end, he renounced that citizenship in the \npresence of his security officer on February 10, 2016 He also had his Philippine \ncitizenship document destroyed, and verified his allegiance only to the United States. \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 6, Government Exhibit 3; Tr. 21-22.) \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of his most recent American passport, valid from April \n2013 to April 2023. That passport showed many Filipino visa stamps during the period \nApplicant still had dual citizenship with the Philippines. (Applicant Exhibit C.) \n \n \n \n\n4 \nParagraph 3 \u2013 Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he made intentional misstatements on an Electronic Questionnaire \nfor Investigations Processing he filled out on February 15, 2016. (Government Exhibit \n1.) Applicant argued that any misstatements he made on the form were mistakes and \nunintentional on his part. \n3.a. Section 17 of Government Exhibit 1 concerns Applicant\u2019s marital status. In\nanswering that question Applicant properly identified his spouse, that she was born in \nthe Philippines, and was an American citizen. The questionnaire also asked, \u201cProvide \nyour spouse\u2019s country(ies) of citizenship.\u201d Applicant stated that his wife was an \nAmerican citizen. He did not further identify her as also being a dual citizen of the \nPhilippines. Applicant testified that he misread the questionnaire on that point, noting \nthat it is formatted differently than Section 10 of Government Exhibit 1, which concerned \nApplicant\u2019s dual or multiple citizenship information. (Tr. 23-25.) \n3.b. Section 20A of Government Exhibit 1 concerns Applicant\u2019s foreign activities.\nUnder that section, he identified his wife as the owner of the chicken rotisserie stand \ndescribed above. Applicant did not identify himself as being a co-owner. Applicant was \ninterviewed by an investigator for the State Department on June 29, 2016. In that \ninterview he identified the business, stated it was not doing well financially, and that his \nwife was going to close it down. Applicant\u2019s involvement in this business was passive \nand minimal. (Government Exhibit 2 at 7-8; Tr. 25, 33.) \n3.c. Section 20A goes on to ask about foreign property that is owned by\nApplicant. He properly identified the house as belonging to himself and his wife. He \nstated that the additional property was owned by his cohabitant. Applicant testified that \nhe was confused by this answer himself, since it was obviously wrong. Applicant told \nthe State Department investigator in June 2016 that the additional property was owned \nby himself and his wife, as shown in the Report of Investigation (ROI). (Government \nExhibit 2 at 8; Tr. 25-27.) \n3.d. Finally, Section 20A asks about any bank accounts Applicant may have in a\nforeign country. Applicant did not identify the three bank accounts he and his wife had in \nthe Philippines. Applicant fully identified these accounts during his June 2016 interview, \nafter admitting to the interviewer that he should have listed them. Applicant testified that \nhe overlooked the specific part of the question that concerned foreign bank accounts. \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 8; Tr. 27-29.) \nMitigation \nApplicant had a successful 20-year career in the Navy. He received many \npersonal decorations. In addition, he has been successful after his return to the Navy as \na civilian employee, as shown by positive evaluations and commendations. (Applicant \nExhibits A, B, and E.) \n\n \n5 \n \nThe Philippines \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The Philippines is a multi-party \nconstitutional republic. There are terroristic threats in several parts of the Philippines, \nparticularly in the south. In addition, there are allegations of human rights abuses by \nmembers of the security forces. \n  \nThe State Department\u2019s \u201cU.S. Relations With the Philippines: Bilateral Relations \nFact Sheet\u201d states:  \n \nU.S.-Philippine relations are based on strong historical and cultural \nlinkages and a shared commitment to democracy and human rights. The \n1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty provides a strong foundation \nfor our robust security partnership, which began during World War II. \nStrong people-to-people ties and economic cooperation provide additional \navenues to engage on a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues. \nThe U.S.-Philippine Bilateral Strategic Dialogue is the annual forum for \nforward planning across the spectrum of our relationship. There are more \nthan four million U.S. citizens of Philippine ancestry in the United States, \nand more than 350,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines, including a large \nnumber of United States veterans. An estimated 650,000 U.S. citizens \nvisit the Philippines each year. . . . Manila is home to the only Veterans \nAdministration regional office outside the United States. (United States \nDepartment of State, U.S. Relations With the Philippines: Bilateral \nRelations \nFact \nSheet, \nhttps://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-the-\nphilippines/ (last updated January 21, 2020).) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n6 \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife and father live in the Philippines. Applicant attended school in \nthe Philippines between 2009 and 2015. He and his wife also own property in the \nPhilippines, have bank accounts there, and owned a small business. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe Philippines has significant internal terrorism threats that operate contrary to \nU.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country have the \npotential to generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The mere possession of close \nfamily ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \n\n \n8 \n \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant is a proud American citizen and Navy veteran. His son is joining the \nU.S. Navy. Applicant\u2019s wife will join him outside the Philippines once their son enlists. \nThe small business his wife owned and managed has closed, thereby vitiating any \nsecurity concerns. The amount of money in the foreign bank accounts is minimal, and \nthey are being closed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (f) apply. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s family lives in the Philippines. \nIn this particular case, I find that Applicant has mitigated the security significance arising \nfrom their presence for the following reasons. The Philippines is a long-time ally of the \nUnited States, with a large American veteran population, of which Applicant was a part. \nApplicant has completely mitigated the security significance of the presence of his \nrelations in the Philippines. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline C (Foreign Preference) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself, the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt of \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or \n\n \n9 \n \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to obtain recognition of \nforeign citizenship. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in another country. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 including: \n \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n \n(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; \n \n(e) the exercise of the entitlement or benefits of foreign citizenship do not \npresent a national security concern; and \n \n(f) the foreign preference, if detected, involves a foreign country, entity or \nassociation that poses a low national security risk. \n \n \nApplicant decided to move back to the Philippines after retirement from the Navy \nand resume citizenship in that country. This is not an uncommon act. Once he decided \nto go back to work for the U.S. Navy, he renounced his Philippine citizenship and \nreaffirmed his loyalty to the United States. There is no allegation of an attempt by \nApplicant to conceal the fact of his citizenship in the Philippines. Nor was any evidence \nproduced showing that there was any conduct on Applicant\u2019s part that would show a \nconflict between his loyalties and interests between the Philippines and the United \nStates. As stated earlier, the Philippines is an ally of the United States with a strong \nAmerican veteran community. All the mitigating conditions apply. Paragraph 2 is found \nfor Applicant. \n \nParagraph 3 \u2013 Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \n\n \n10 \n \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility, or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nThe following mitigating condition is applicable under AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answers on his security clearance questionnaire were not complete. \nHowever, I find they were not intentionally deceptive for the following reasons. First of \nall, with respect to allegations 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c, it is noted that Applicant\u2019s answers, \nwhile incomplete, put the Government on notice concerning those issues. Applicant \nproperly identified his wife as a foreign-born American, that she owned a foreign \nbusiness, and that a \u201ccohabitant\u201d related to him owned property in the Philippines. \nWhen questioned by a State Department investigator Applicant readily provided the \ncomplete and accurate information. Therefore, concerning those questions, I find there \nwas no deliberate attempt to omit, conceal or falsify the information. \n \n \nTurning to allegation 3.d, Applicant corrected the record during his interview with \na State Department investigator. He fully disclosed information about the three bank \naccounts, the activity on the accounts, and the minimal amount of money in the \naccounts. This was four months after filling the questionnaire out, and was his first \nofficial opportunity to review and correct his answers. Under the particular \ncircumstances of this case, his actions amount to a prompt, good-faith effort to correct \nthe record. Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his misstatements on \nGovernment Exhibit 1. Paragraph 3 is found for Applicant. \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B, C, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant has shown himself to be a talented and patriotic American citizen, Navy \nveteran, and member of the defense industry. He can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States due to his overwhelming sense of loyalty \nto the United States; and has minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence, Foreign \nPreference, and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3: Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Ott, Esq. \n04/16/2020 \nDecision \nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant fully mitigated the Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference concerns \ncreated by her contacts and connections with Turkey. Based upon a review of the record \nas a whole, national security eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nHistory of Case \nOn September 11, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 2, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C (Foreign \nPreference. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines for national security \neligibility effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 8, 2019 (Answer). She admitted \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b, with some explanations. She \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f, because those circumstances had changed. \nShe also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on July 29, 2019. DOHA issued \na Notice of Hearing on August 9, 2019, setting the hearing for September 12, 2019. On \nthat date, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into evidence. \nApplicant called three witnesses, testified on her own behalf, and offered Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I took administrative \nnotice of relevant facts concerning the Republic of Turkey, which were set forth in the \nGovernment\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice. I left the record open until October 12, \n2019, to permit additional submissions. Applicant timely submitted additional written \nevidence, which was marked AE B and admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 23, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. She was born and lived in Turkey until age 26, when she \nmoved to the United States for three and a half years to work, on an L-1 visa, for a Turkish \naerospace company in collaboration with a major U.S. defense contractor on a NATO \nforeign military sales contract. She met her husband, who is a native-born U.S. citizen, \nthrough their work during that period. He moved to Turkey for work in 2007, and they \nbegan dating after she moved back to Turkey in 2008. They married in Turkey in 2010, \nand have no children. They moved back to the United States in 2012, and she became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in November 2012. (GE 1; GE 2; AE B.) \n \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautical engineering at a Turkish \nuniversity in 2001. She has never been employed in military or civil service for any \ngovernment. She worked, supporting NATO contracts, for two different Turkish aerospace \ncompanies from 2003 to 2012, and was granted Turkish and NATO security clearances \nin connection with that work. After she and her husband returned to the United States, \nshe was unemployed until resolving her legal employment status, for immigration \npurposes, and then resumed employment in her area of expertise. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 39, \n79-80, 96, 101-103.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is 87 years old. He is a lifelong citizen and resident of Turkey, \nand now lives alone in the family\u2019s condominium flat. He retired in 1996 from his position \nas a personnel manager at the Turkish Ministry of Health. Applicant\u2019s mother passed \naway in 2014, at which point she, as her parent\u2019s only child, automatically inherited 75% \nownership in the family flat. After recent exchange-rate fluctuations and an assessment \nof the local real estate market, the flat is estimated to be worth between $36,000 and \n$54,000. Applicant will eventually inherit her father\u2019s 25% interest in the flat, and she \nintends to sell it at that point. She has no intention of returning to Turkey, other than her \nannual visits to see her father and check on his welfare. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. \n43-46, 53, 80-84, 99.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nSeveral years ago, Applicant set up cable and cell phone services for her father\u2019s \nuse. She arranged to make automatic payments from her account in a Turkish bank, \nbecause he did not know how to do that. During her last visit to see her father in Turkey, \nshe arranged for the payments to be made from his account, and closed hers, to avoid \ngenerating perceived security clearance concerns. The former payments were modest, \nand he does not depend on her for financial support in his retirement. She also closed, or \nwithdrew all funds, from her other bank accounts in Turkey. All of her financial assets are \nnow held in the United States. (Answer; Tr. 46-47, 85-88.) \n \n \nApplicant listed four longtime friends from Turkey on her e-QIP. They are former \ncoworkers she and her husband met and socialized with during their time working in \nTurkey. They have only occasional and casual contact now, primarily discussing family \nevents or sharing a meal when she is in Turkey to visit her father. They do not discuss \neach other\u2019s work, and Applicant feels no obligation toward any of them beyond extending \ncommon courtesies. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 38-39, 47-51, 84-85.) \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant traveled to the closest Turkish consulate, which is located in a \nCanadian city across the border, with some friends for a getaway weekend and to vote in \nthe Turkish election held that year. She traveled using her U.S. passport, but used her \nTurkish identity card to document her eligibility to vote in the election. She did this \nbecause she read a number of U.S. Government statements indicating the importance of \nthe election results for U.S.-Turkish relations, and wanted to vote in favor of the outcome \npreferred by the United States. She has no intention to vote in any future Turkish \nelections, and has voted in every U.S. election since she gained citizenship and eligibility \nto vote. (Answer; GE 2; Tr. 40-42, 57-58, 88-91.) \n \n \nFrom about 2003 to 2011, while Applicant worked for a Turkish aerospace \ncompany involved in aircraft procurement programs in support of NATO, she held both \nTurkish and NATO security clearances. These clearances were required for her NATO-\nrelated employment, and lapsed after she left that employment for a better job, then \nmoved to the United States with her husband. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 39, 102-103.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband and two of her current coworkers testified concerning her \nexcellent character, integrity, and dedicated loyalty to the United States as her adopted \ncountry. She is an assiduous rule follower and complies with all measures and procedures \ninvolving protected, sensitive, and classified information. She has immersed herself in \nworkplace, community, and national cultural events, customs, and practices. Five other \nfriends and coworkers wrote letters expressing similar observations. Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony was direct, open, and impressive. (AE A; Tr. 37-103.)    \n   \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npublications concerning the Republic of Turkey, as outlined on pages 2 through 5 of HE \nII, including the following: Turkey is a constitutional republic. It is a member of NATO and \nthe counter-ISIL coalition. On February 5, 2019, the United States and Turkey issued a \njoint statement reaffirming the strategic importance of their relationship, and committed \nto addressing shared concerns as allies. There are some conditions in Turkey that are \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nproblematic, including ongoing activities by terrorist organizations, expanded state police \npowers implemented to address them, and reports of some significant human rights \nissues. (HE II.)    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 requires that the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties.  \n \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three of them are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n \nApplicant has commendable connections and feelings of familial obligation with \nher 87-year-old father, who is a lifelong resident and citizen of Turkey. She also has \nnormal, and freely disclosed, casual relationships with former coworkers in Turkey and \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ntheir families. She used to have modest bank accounts in Turkey, which have all been \nemptied and closed. She retains the inherited 75% ownership interest in the family \ncondominium flat, where her father continues to live and holds the remaining 25% interest \nas a matter of Turkish law. The full value of this flat is probably less than $50,000, and \nshe intends to sell it when her father no longer lives there. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise potential concerns under these disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to prove mitigation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns. \nThose with potential application in mitigating the security concerns in this case are: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant fully established that it is unlikely that she could be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government and those \nof the United States as a consequence of her commendable relationship with her father, \nor with her casual friends in Turkey. Those connections create no significant potential for \nconflict of interest or risk of coercion, exploitation, manipulation, or pressure. She has \nwithdrawn all of her financial assets from her former Turkish accounts, and she only \nretains her modest inherited ownership interest in her parents\u2019 family flat so her father \ncan continue to live there in retirement. Accordingly, Applicant fully established mitigation \nof all foreign influence concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), (c), and (f). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nGuideline C \u2013 Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern for this Guideline is found in AG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself, the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. (Emphasis in original.) \n \n \nA comprehensive review of the facts in this case yielded no evidence that would \nraise any of the disqualifying conditions that are set forth in AG \u00b6 10. Applicant\u2019s exercise \nof her right to vote in a Turkish election is expressly excluded by the above-quoted \nlanguage, and was only done to advance what she perceived to be the U.S. interest in \nthe outcome. Her possession of Turkish and NATO security clearances from 2003 to \n2011, while working in support of a NATO program and before her marriage to a U.S. \ncitizen and naturalization, raises no concerns. There is no need to list the foreign \npreference mitigating conditions, but any concerns under this guideline would be fully \nmitigated under those listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 11 (a) through (f). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The security concerns alleged in the SOR \ndo not arise from any questionable conduct by Applicant, but rather circumstances that \nare normal results of her commendable relationships with her father and former \ncoworkers, \nresponsible \nfinancial \nmanagement, \nand \nimpressive \nprofessional \naccomplishments. Applicant is a mature person, and a proud naturalized U.S. citizen. \nThere is no evidence or allegation that she has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States. She fully alleviated any formerly significant potential \nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant fully met her \nburden to mitigate the foreign influence, and any foreign preference, security concerns \nraised by the facts of this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no doubt as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. National security eligibility is granted. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nDAVID M. WHITE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 19, 2019, scheduling the hearing for \nSeptember 11, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6 were \nmarked and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-I, which were marked and admitted without objection. (He \nprovided AE A-F with his Answer). I held the record open until September 25, 2019, to \nenable him the opportunity to submit additional information. He timely submitted several \ndocuments, which are marked as AE J-M and admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 20, 2019.  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice (AN) of certain \nfacts about Colombia. The supporting documentation is marked as AN I. The relevant \nfacts are addressed in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 \n2.c), with narrative explanations. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He and his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen from \nColombia, have been married for 14 years. He has an adult son from a prior marriage. \nAfter graduating from college in 1983, he spent 28 years in the U.S. Air Force, retiring in \n2011 as a lieutenant colonel. In the Air Force, he attended postgraduate school and \nextensive language training, and had a clearance. Since May 2019, Applicant has \nworked for a private company chartered by a state government to provide assistance to \nthe state in veterans\u2019 and defense issues. He earns a $78,000 annual salary. (Tr. 41, \n87-89, 107, 118-119; AE J-M) He has been sponsored for a clearance by a prospective \nemployer in the defense industry. (Tr. 37-42, 50-51; GE 1) \n \nThe Guideline B allegations concern Applicant\u2019s in-laws. They include his wife\u2019s \nparents (SOR \u00b6 2.c), two brothers-in-law (one of whom is an officer in the Colombian \nArmy) (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and a sister-in-law (who is employed by the Colombian military as a \ncivilian psychologist). (SOR \u00b6 2.b) (Tr. 122-123) \n \nApplicant met his wife in 2003, while he was assigned in Colombia as a foreign \narea officer. Her father was the pastor of the church he attended there. Applicant \nmarried his wife in 2005. She became a permanent U.S. resident in 2006, and a U.S. \ncitizen in 2010. (Tr. 10, 41, 62-64, 122-124) Applicant and his wife also lived in \nColombia, with her parents, from May 2017 to May 2019, as discussed further below. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nNow that Applicant and his wife have returned to the United States, he has about \nmonthly contact with her family members. (Tr. 117) \n \nApplicant disclosed his wife\u2019s family during his prior background investigation, in \n2008. (GE 2; Tr. 67) Subsequently, in 2012, his sister-in-law married a Colombian Army \nofficer. Applicant and his wife attended their wedding and his promotion ceremony. \nThey had frequent contact when they all lived in the same city in Colombia, but had less \ncontact once the brother-in-law was transferred elsewhere in the country. (Tr. 113-116) \nApplicant\u2019s other brother-in-law (his wife\u2019s brother) is a businessman in Colombia. (Tr. \n122)  \n \n \nThe record also reflects that, when he was a foreign area officer assigned in \nColombia, Applicant had assignments in which he would have had regular, professional \ncontact with officers in the Colombian military. (GE 6)  \n \n \nApplicant faced mandatory retirement from the Air Force in late 2011. (Tr. 72-74) \nHe had difficulty finding civilian employment after he retired. He testified that this was \ndue, in part, to the economic recession and the impact of the 2012-2013 budget \nsequestration, furlough, and government shutdown, upon employment in the defense \nindustry. (Tr. 41-43, 98-100)  \n \nApplicant testified that he earned about $100,000 base pay in the Air Force. He \nreceives 70% in retirement income ($70,000), but 50% of that goes to his former wife, \nso he saw a significant drop in income after he retired. Beginning in 2012, he also \nearned $650 a month (now $685) in disability pay. (Tr. 71-72)  \n \n \nApplicant was briefly employed in 2012 at a $95,000 annual salary but was laid \noff in August 2012 when the contract ended. (Tr. 78-79, 104) He eventually found work \nat a start-up company, but his monthly income varied and was significantly less than \nwhat he earned as an Air Force officer.  \n \nApplicant was initially a \u201c1099\u201d (contractor) employee with the start-up company. \nFor several years, this led him to incur a larger tax burden than he expected. He took \nsteps to address the issue, and completed a repayment plan with the IRS in 2017. He \nhas no other tax issues, and there is no allegation relating to past-due taxes in the SOR. \n(Tr. 57-60, 100-102; AE D)  \n \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s loss of income, he also fell behind on monthly debts, \nincluding his mortgage. He used credit cards to pay for necessary expenses, such as \nfood, gas, and medical expenses. (Tr. 43) Facing foreclosure in 2015, he was able to \nstabilize his mortgage and bring it current through a state-run mortgage assistance \nprogram. (Tr. 43-48, 80-82, 124-126; GE 5) \n \n \nApplicant was laid off from the start-up company in April 2017. Despite his \nefforts, he was unable to find stable employment. He sold the family home, and \nrelocated with his wife to Colombia. They moved in with her parents. He did this to lower \n\n \n4 \n \n \nexpenses and to take advantage of a beneficial currency exchange rate while he \ncontinued to seek full-time employment in the United States. (Tr. 46-49, 83-84; GE 5)  \n \nApplicant had $90,000 in proceeds from the sale of the family home. He used \n$60,000 to begin to pay his debts, starting with his IRS debt and his other accounts. He \ntestified that (along with his tax debt) he had as many as 17 past-due debts, of which 12 \nare now paid off. (AE A, AE B, AE C, AE E; Tr. 54-59, 82-87) He testified that he settled \nmost of those debts between June and November 2017. He received 1099 forms from \nthe IRS for several accounts, and claimed the forgiven amounts as income. (Tr. 96-97, \n124-126; AE C) \n \nWhile in Colombia, Applicant did volunteer work at his wife\u2019s family\u2019s church, but \nhe did not seek paid employment. He said he did not want to establish concrete ties \nthere because he intended to return to the U.S. Since he was not working, he lived off of \nhis military retirement and VA disability income. (Tr. 48-53, 82-87, 106-107; AE A) \n \nApplicant and his wife lived in Colombia for two years, from May 2017 to May \n2019. He returned to the U.S. occasionally, such as for medical appointments and his \nbackground interview. He testified that, without full-time employment, there was little he \ncould do to address the remaining debts, as he wanted to save money to finance his \neventual return to the U.S. He pursued credit counseling, and was advised either to file \nbankruptcy, or to pursue his current course of action. (Tr. 105-111, 120) \n \n \nThe five debts alleged in the SOR total about $48,000. They are listed on \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports from September 2017 and February 2019. (GE 3, GE \n4) He testified that the SOR debts are what remains from his original debt load of 17 \nconsumer debts and his debt to the IRS.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($20,085) is a charged-off credit card account. Shortly before the \nhearing, Applicant arranged to settle the debt for $8,500, paying $250 a month from \nSeptember 2019 until June 2022. He had made two prior payments earlier in 2019, \nlowering the balance to $19,585. (AE G; Tr. 90-92) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($14,812) and 1.c ($7,686) are charged-off credit card accounts, and \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($4,807) is a credit card debt in collection. Applicant said he used the \naccounts to pay living expenses like food, gas, and medical bills. He contacted the \ncreditors in 2017 but could not work out repayment plans that left him enough money in \nsavings to relocate back to the U.S. He has not contacted them to arrange a payment \nplan since beginning his new job, but intends to do so. (Tr. 93-94)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($706) is a credit-card account in collection. Applicant intends to \nresolve this debt next, given its relatively small size. (Tr. 94-95) \n \nApplicant\u2019s accounts and his wife\u2019s accounts are otherwise current, and he has \nincurred no new debts. (Tr. 60-61, AE F; GE 3) Applicant plans on addressing the SOR \ndebts one at a time. (Answer; AE A; Tr. 54-57) He expects to be able to do so more \n\n \n5 \n \n \naggressively once he identifies his monthly expenses and income stream after his \nrecent transition back to employment in the U.S. (Tr. 126) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he always intended to return from Colombia once he \nfound a job in the U.S. He never intended to live there as long as he did, and does not \nintend to return to live there permanently in the future. (Tr. 121) \n \n \nThe chief executive officer of Applicant\u2019s sponsor for a clearance provided a \nrecommendation letter. He is a retired Navy captain who had a high-level intelligence \nposition at U.S. Central Command. The reference has known Applicant since 2004, \nwhen Applicant served under him in highly classified roles. Applicant has his utmost \ntrust and confidence, and highest recommendation for a clearance. (AE H; Tr. 69) \n \n \nAnother reference has known Applicant since 2013, when they began working \ntogether. He asserted that Applicant has demonstrated unwavering commitment and \nloyalty to the nation, and still upholds the oath Applicant took years ago upon entering \nthe Air Force. (AE I; Tr. 69) \n \nColombia \n \n \nWith its Administrative Notice filing (AN I), the Government included information \nfrom the U.S. Department of State as of August 2018 about the United States\u2019 relations \nwith Colombia. The information in that document is substantially similar to more recent \ninformation, available on the State Department website.  \n \nI take administrative notice of the updated facts, consistent with my obligation to \nmake assessments based on timely information in cases involving foreign influence. \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) (\u201cDecisions in Guideline B \ncases should be made to the greatest extent possible in the context of current political \nconditions in the country at issue.\u201d) The information is detailed as follows:  \n \nWith the support of the United States, Colombia has transformed itself \nover the past 20 years from a fragile state to a vibrant democracy with a \ngrowing, market-oriented economy.  \n \nIn 2016, the Government of Colombia signed a peace accord with the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), ending more than half \na century of conflict. \n \nThe United States is committed to cooperating with Colombia to \nundermine the transnational criminal organizations whose activities, \nespecially narcotrafficking, are devastating to the citizens of Colombia and \nof the United States.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIn addition, the State Department advises on its website that U.S. citizens considering \ntravel to Colombia should exercise increased caution, given the risk of crime, terrorism, \nand kidnapping.  \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nclassified information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or classified information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and   \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding [classified] information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. It \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be \nconsidered.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s family connections to Colombia include his wife\u2019s parents, two \nbrothers-in-law, and a sister-in-law. The sister-in-law and one brother-in-law are \nemployed by the Colombian military. These connections raise a \u201cpotential conflict of \ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or classified information \nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology\u201d under AG \u00b6 7(b). A heightened risk is also \nestablished, given the administrative notice facts about Colombia and the State \nDepartment\u2019s travel advisory. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) therefore apply.  \n \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant and his wife lived with her parents in Colombia for two years, from May \n2017 to May 2019, while Applicant was unemployed. They are clearly close to her \nfamily, even if their contact has lessened now that they have returned to the U.S. AG \u00b6 \n8(c) does not apply.  \n \nHowever, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) do apply, and mitigate the \nGuideline B security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s family connections to Colombia. \nPerhaps most importantly in this regard, I give significant weight to Applicant\u2019s long \nexperience not only as an Air Force officer in general, but as an intelligence officer and \nforeign area officer in particular. Someone with Applicant\u2019s professional background is \nparticularly attuned to the possibility of foreign influence, coercive or otherwise, thus \nlessening the risk of any such susceptibility.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nColombia is also undergoing transformation. This creates an atmosphere that is \nnot without risk. However, there is no indication in the record that either Applicant or his \nwife\u2019s family have been adversely affected by the ongoing security risks in Colombia as \nnoted by the State Department. Indeed, Applicant lived in Colombia for two years, \nwithout incident. He also served there during his Air Force career and had professional \ncontact with the Colombian military. While some elements of heightened risk exist, \nApplicant\u2019s personal circumstances significantly lessen the chances that he might be \nsubject to exploitation, coercion, or duress through his relationship with his Colombian \nin-laws. AG \u00b6 8(a) therefore applies.  \nWhile Applicant and his wife have understandably strong connections to her \nparents and family members in Colombia, this is outweighed by Applicant\u2019s long career \nin the Air Force, as an intelligence officer and foreign area officer, with a clearance. With \nthat background, Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe best interests of the United States. Applicant met his burden of persuasion in \nestablishing that AG \u00b6 8(b) applies to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns \narising in this case. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, security, and ability to protect \nclassified or classified information. Financial distress can also be caused \nor exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation.1 \n \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns under the \nfinancial considerations guideline. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \n \nApplicant incurred numerous financial delinquencies after retiring from the Air \nForce, a period in which he had extended difficulty finding steady employment. The five \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR are established, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, security, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nAfter Applicant retired from the Air Force in 2011, he had significant difficulty \nfinding gainful employment. In 2012, he worked briefly on a short-term contract. He then \njoined a start-up company and had sporadic income for several years. He was initially a \n1099 contractor employee, which led to unforeseen tax implications. He fell behind on \nnumerous financial obligations including his federal taxes, his mortgage, and a large \nnumber of consumer debts. He also began using credit cards to pay necessary \nexpenses.  \nApplicant was facing foreclosure, but refinanced his mortgage through a state-\nrun assistance program. When he was laid off in 2017, he sold the home, realizing \n$90,000 in proceeds. Without imminent job prospects in the United States, he decided \nto relocate temporarily to Colombia with his wife, and move in with her parents. He did \nthis to cut expenses. He used about $60,000 of the home sale proceeds to resolve his \nfederal tax debt and several of his other delinquencies. He did this in 2017, keeping \nsome of the proceeds in reserve.  \nApplicant testified, and documented, that he had as many as 17 delinquent debts \n(as well as the tax debt), of which 5 debts remain in the SOR. The Government took \nissue in closing argument with the fact that Applicant did not seek employment in \nColombia, and thus was not able to address his debts during that time. However, as \n\n \n11 \n \n \nApplicant noted, he did not expect to remain there as long as he did, and he did not \nwant to establish any more ties there than necessary. Indeed, as he also noted in his \nclosing argument, to do so might have expanded the potential for foreign influence \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s ties to his family in Colombia which already existed.  \nApplicant, in short, made a judgment call about how to best address his financial \nsituation. His decision process, while not without risks and consequences, was not \nunreasonable. The Appeal Board has held that it is not necessary to pay off all the \ndebts alleged in the SOR, nor is it required that they be paid off in any particular way. \nWhat is required is only that an Applicant have a reasonable plan to pay off his debts, \nand have taken some steps towards execution of that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n09-08462 at 3 (App. Bd. May 3, 2011). I find that the record evidence supports this \nconclusion here.  \nIn doing so, I consider that the SOR is essentially a  \u201csnapshot\u201d of Applicant\u2019s \ndebts, and I must also consider the whole picture, not only of the debts alleged, but also \nthe debts that were previously resolved, such as the 12 other debts Applicant resolved, \nwhen he was able to do so, his tax debt, and his mortgage. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d) \ntherefore apply. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing, so AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. But given \nApplicant\u2019s overall record of addressing his debts when he has been able to do so, I \nconsider it likely that, having reestablished life in the United States, with gainful \nemployment, Applicant will continue to address his delinquencies in a responsible way. \nThe ongoing nature of the debts therefore does not cast doubt on his current judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ndetermination of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant presented a credible case in mitigation and in support of his application \nfor access to classified information. I observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and I found him to \nbe a credible witness. As noted above, I give significant weight in this case to \nApplicant\u2019s long career in the Air Force as an officer with an intelligence background in \nfinding the security concerns in this case mitigated under both guidelines alleged, and \nunder the whole-person concept. After carefully weighing the evidence, both favorable \nand unfavorable, and considering the whole-person factors set forth in AG \u00b6 2(d), I find \nthat Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his family connections to \nColombia, and by his financial issues. The record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for access to classified information. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising in this case.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline 2:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \nFebruary 10, 2020 \nDecision \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines E (personal \nconduct), F (financial considerations), and J (criminal conduct). In December 2015, \nApplicant was fired by her employer for her misuse of her company credit card, theft of \ncompany credit cards issued to other employees, and theft of cash from a co-worker. \nApplicant also failed to timely pay her federal taxes for tax years (TY) 2014 through 2017 \nand owes about $8,600 of back taxes to her state government for TY 2015 through 2017. \nIn addition, she is indebted to approximately ten creditors in a total amount of about \n$14,000. She presented insufficient evidence in mitigation of the security concerns raised \nby her conduct and financial delinquencies. National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 16, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking to renew a previously granted clearance. On April 23, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines E, F, and J. The DOD CAF \nacted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n\n2 \n \n(February 20, 1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) effective for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 24, 2019, and requested a hearing. On \nAugust 15, 2019, she provided a supplemental answer to the SOR and changed her \nposition about a hearing. Instead of a hearing, she elected to have her case decided on \nthe written record. In her supplemental answer, she admitted with some explanations \nmany of the SOR allegations and provided a detailed response to the allegations about \nher misconduct as an employee (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), which she admitted, and the cross-\nallegation regarding her criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.a), which she also admitted. In \naddition, she claimed to have paid her past-due federal taxes and three of the 13 debts \nalleged in the SOR, but provided no documentary evidence to support her claim. \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case in a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM), dated August 30, 2019, which included nine attached documents \nidentified as Items 1-9. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who \nwas afforded an opportunity to file within 30 days of her receipt of the FORM any \nobjections and to submit a written response and documents to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised by the SOR allegations. Applicant received the \nFORM on September 12, 2019. She did not submit any objections or a response. I have \nmarked Items 1 through 9 attached to the FORM as Government Exhibit (GE) 1-9, \nrespectively. In the absence of any objection from Applicant, I have admitted all of the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence into the record. The case was assigned to me on November 21, \n2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in her response to the SOR allegations \nin my findings of fact, and I have noted her comments in mitigation. Applicant\u2019s personal \ninformation is extracted from GE 4, her SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a \nparenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nthe Government\u2019s FORM, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 37, has worked as a junior configuration manager for a federal \ncontractor since March 2018. She received a high school diploma and has some college \ncredits, but she has not earned a degree. She enlisted in the U.S. Navy in June 2000 and \nserved until December 2009, when she was honorably discharged. She has married \ntwice, first in 2002, and then in 2009. Her first marriage ended in divorce in 2006. She \nhas one minor child. She was granted a secret clearance in 2000 and a top secret \nclearance in 2003 while in the Navy, but does not presently hold a clearance. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant experienced significant financial problems in 2015. The cause of these \nproblems is not in the record. She borrowed money from family and friends. She found a \npotential source of a loan online and pursued a request for a loan of $18,000. It turned \nout that the online lender was running a scam and somehow convinced Applicant to pay \nover $100,000 in \u201cfees\u201d via wire transfers to various recipients in African countries. It is \nnot apparent from the record how Applicant secured that much money to pay the fees. \nShe claims that she was being coerced with threats of arrest if she did not honor her \ncommitment to pay the fees. In essence, Applicant paid $100,000 in blackmail over a \nnumber of months in 2015 to avoid \u201carrest,\u201d which would mean her family would learn \nwhat she had done. \n \n \nOne source of the funds Applicant used to pay her blackmailer (the Scam Artist) \nwas her company credit card. She incurred about $16,000 in unauthorized charges \npurchasing gift cards, which she converted into cash. She also surreptitiously took \ncompany credit cards from the wallets of co-workers and purchased gift cards on those \ncredit cards to raise cash.  \n \n \nWhen her employer discovered her misconduct, it terminated her in December \n2015 for her \u201cgross misconduct in connection with [her] misappropriation and abuse of \ncorporate credit cards.\u201d After she lost her job, she defaulted on her home mortgage and \nthe lender foreclosed on her home. Since her theft occurred on Navy property, the Navy \nCriminal Investigation Service (NCIS) investigated and sought charges under two federal \ncriminal statutes. The record is incomplete regarding the disposition of the charges. (GE \n3, 5, 6, 7 at 4.) \n \nSOR Allegations, Evidence, and Findings \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges in SOR \u00b6 1.a Applicant\u2019s December 2015 \ntermination of employment and the reasons for her employer\u2019s actions described above. \nIt also alleges in SOR \u00b6 1.b her involvement in the fraudulent loan and the extraordinary \namount of fees she paid, supposedly in an effort to secure an $18,000 loan, using money \npaid to her on an insurance claim, personal credit cards, and loans from family members, \namong many sources. The allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a involving theft are cross-alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 3.a under Guideline J. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted her criminal misconduct in her supplemental SOR answer. She \nnotes that she stopped paying the Scam Artist in December 2015. She wrote that she did \nnot take cash from her co-worker, but understood that her denial was not believed \nbecause she admitted removing the company credit cards from the wallets of her co-\nworkers. She repaid the $180. Her employer did not seek reimbursement of the charges \nshe put on her company credit card. She regrets her mistakes in 2015 and feels remorse \nover what she did and the damage she caused herself and her family. (GE 3; GE 5 at 3; \nGE 7.) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant owes a total of about $46,000 to the IRS and \nher state government, as well as a number of commercial creditors. Applicant\u2019s responses \n\n4 \n \nto the Government\u2019s interrogatories confirm the SOR allegations regarding her tax debts, \nas of March 15, 2019. As noted, she claimed in her supplemental answer to the SOR that \nshe has paid her federal tax debts of about $10,000 for TY 2014 through 2017. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a-2.d.) She provided no documentary evidence to support her claims that she has paid \nher federal tax delinquencies. (GE 3 at 12-13; GE 5 at 7, 8.) \n \n \nApplicant also claimed that she was in the process of setting up a payment plan to \npay about $8,600 in delinquent taxes owed to her state government for TY 2015 through \n2017. She apparently incurred these tax delinquencies by under withholding on her \nincome or that of her husband, who serves in the U.S. military. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e-2.g.) (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant further claims that she is paying off a credit-card debt of $10,500 \npursuant to a payment plan (SOR \u00b6 2.i.) and has paid three other debts alleged in the \nSOR totaling about $2,400. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.n, 2.p, and 2.t.). Applicant also admitted an SOR \nallegation that her mortgage lender foreclosed on her home after defaulting in 2015. The \nforeclosure was concluded in 2017 and Applicant has no further obligation on that loan. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.h.) The two credit reports in the record establish Applicant\u2019s commercial debts \nas alleged in the SOR. (GE 3; GE 5 at 4; GE 7, GE 8.) \n \n \nAssuming Applicant\u2019s claims are truthful, she still is indebted to 11 creditors in the \ntotal amount of over $22,000. In her supplemental SOR answer, she wrote that she \nintends to pay off these creditors with payment plans as soon as she has paid the one \nshe currently is paying under a payments plan. (GE 3.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable in making a decision. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n5 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR answer, and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord, establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources;  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(f): violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(g): association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes all of the above potentially disqualifying \nconditions. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s behavior leading up to her dismissal by her \nemployer \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, and other characteristics indicating that Applicant may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. This behavior demonstrates a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations and a significant misuse of her employer's resources. Her financial dealings \nwith an obvious criminal that eventually amounted to paying blackmail to keep her \n\n7 \n \nhusband, family, and friends from knowing the truth about her actions, demonstrates her \nvulnerability to exploitation by others. Her conduct also involves activities, which, if known, \ncould affect her personal, professional, and community standing. While the record \nevidence is incomplete regarding a written or recorded commitment as a condition of \nemployment, her employer\u2019s trust in giving her a company credit card was violated by her \nactions. Lastly, association with the Scam Artist through her payments of over $100,000 \nto a person who was obviously engaged in criminal conduct raises serious security \nconcerns. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt \nupon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s offenses were serious, frequent, and recent. While the circumstances \nwere unique, it is foreseeable that she could exercise poor judgment again when facing \nfinancial pressures. Her continued payments of such large sums of money to the Scam \nArtist casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nApplicant has acknowledged her criminal behavior and her irresponsible actions \nthat caused serious financial damage to her family, including the loss of her job and their \nhome. There is no evidence that she obtained any counseling, however. She remains \nunder significant financial pressure with unpaid taxes and debts. The stressors that \ncontributed to her untrustworthy, unreliable, and inappropriate behavior remain, making \nit impossible to conclude that other irresponsible behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) \nis only partially established. \n \n \nApplicant has disclosed her past mistakes to her husband, which reduces her \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. The Scam Artist is still able to contact \n\n8 \n \nher and threaten her. She is not free of any future vulnerability to exploitation. AG \u00b6 17(e) \nis only partially established. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s association with the Scam Artist was initially unwitting, but as it became \nobvious that he was engaged in a criminal scheme, she continued to borrow and then \nsteal funds to meet his blackmail demands. Her association with this criminal continued \nfor many months in 2015 and casts doubt upon her reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand willingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 17(g) is only partially \nestablished.  \n \n \nAs a whole, Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence does not sufficiently mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by her personal conduct. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR answer, and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord, establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); \n19(d) (\u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft . . . \nexpense account fraud . . . and other intentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d); and 19(f) \n(\u201cfailure to . . . pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \n\n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAs noted above, the behavior was not infrequent or did not happen so long ago. It \noccurred under unusual circumstances, but since Applicant continues to experience \nfinancial distress, it cannot be concluded that her financial issues are unlikely to recur. \nMoreover, her behavior casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.  \n \n \nApplicant claims that she has paid her federal tax delinquencies and three of her \ncommercial debts, but has offered no documentary evidence to support her assertions. \nEven if she has paid her federal tax debts and a few other debts, she has numerous large \ndebts remaining, including state tax delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(e) only partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant writes that she has paid her 2014 through 2017 federal taxes. However, \nthe fact that she allowed delinquencies to occur for several years after she had stopped \nmaking blackmail payments to the Scam Artist undercuts the mitigation value of any \npayments she has made since March 2019 when she disclosed her federal and state tax \ndebts in her interrogatory responses. She also owes state taxes in the approximate \namount of $8,600 as of the close of the record for TY 2015 through 2017. AG \u00b6 20(g) only \npartially applies.  \n \n \nAs a whole, Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence does not sufficiently mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by her financial considerations. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR answer and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n\n10 \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of her company credit card, her theft of the corporate credit \ncards of two colleagues, and her admitted crime of stealing cash from a colleague were \nnot minor offenses. They also evidence a pattern of criminal conduct that that casts doubt \non her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are \nestablished. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(b): the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act \nand those pressures are no longer present in the person's life. \n \n \nAs noted above, insufficient time has elapsed since Applicant committed the \ncriminal behavior to eliminate the likelihood that she might commit similar crimes in the \nfuture. The circumstances under which she committed these crimes were unusual, but \nthe underlying cause was Applicant\u2019s financial problems, which are still present. She \nsought a \u201cloan\u201d of $18,000 to solve her family\u2019s financial debts. She presently owes more \nthan that in taxes and consumer debts. Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior casts doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. \n \n \nApplicant was pressured into a situation by the Scam Artist where she felt she had \nno choice but to take funds from her employer and violate her co-workers trust by stealing \nand misusing their corporate credit cards. It took her far too long to realize that she had \nmade the wrong choice. Even though the Scam Artist is still trying to contact her, she has \nmade the right choice to ignore his communications. AG \u00b6 32(b) is established. \n \n \nAs a whole, Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence does not sufficiently mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by her criminal conduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a  \n \n \n\n11 \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, F, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, F, and J and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her personal conduct, financial considerations, and criminal \nconduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.e through 2.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.j through 2.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.q through 2.s:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.t:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.u:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Criminal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n12 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant failed to file income tax returns for thirteen years. He also has \nsubstantial past-due indebtedness. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant has yet to file tax returns for tax years \n2005~2011. He has also only recently addressed one of his five admitted past-due \ndebts. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.  \n: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. through 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact Applicant is 22 years old, and he was born in the United States. He is engaged, and his fianc\u00e9e has a young son who resides with them. He attended school in Iraq and received a high school certificate in 2012, but he does not have a general education diploma. Applicant has worked as a mortgage broker since May 2019. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a DOD security clearance. He is seeking a security clearance to be a linguist for a defense contractor in Iraq, which would increase his salary. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12, 20-23, 26-28, 57-58) Criminal Conduct: In March 2012, Applicant was arrested for domestic assault and battery after he punched his stepmother twice in the face, breaking her nose. He was 14 at the time of the arrest, and as a result he spent a month in juvenile detention. After this incident, Applicant\u2019s father sent him to live in Iraq with Applicant\u2019s aunt.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/19/2020 \nDecision \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, \npersonal conduct, and foreign family members. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \nHistory of Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 7, 2017. \nOn March 14, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), E (Personal \nConduct), and B (Foreign Influence). Applicant answered the SOR on April 26, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge (Answer). I was assigned to the case \non June 20, 2019, and I issued an order to both parties to produce their documentary \nevidence by July 22, 2019. On July 8, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for August 7, 2019. On August \n2, 2019, with Applicant\u2019s approval, the hearing was rescheduled for August 6, 2019.  \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified and requested that the record be held \nopen until August 20, 2019, to allow him time to submit documentation. On August 21, \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n2019, Applicant requested an extension to submit documentation. A new suspense date \nof August 26, 2019, was set without objection. Applicant did not submit documentation. I \nreceived the completed transcript (Tr.) on August 20, 2019, and the record closed on \nAugust 26, 2019. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq. Those facts are set forth in the \nGovernment\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice for Iraq, marked as HE I. These \ndocuments are included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are limited to \nmatters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. Those facts \nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 22 years old, and he was born in the United States. He is engaged, \nand his fianc\u00e9e has a young son who resides with them. He attended school in Iraq and \nreceived a high school certificate in 2012, but he does not have a general education \ndiploma. Applicant has worked as a mortgage broker since May 2019. This is Applicant\u2019s \nfirst application for a DOD security clearance. He is seeking a security clearance to be a \nlinguist for a defense contractor in Iraq, which would increase his salary. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12, \n20-23, 26-28, 57-58)  \nCriminal Conduct: \nIn March 2012, Applicant was arrested for domestic assault and battery after he \npunched his stepmother twice in the face, breaking her nose. He was 14 at the time of \nthe arrest, and as a result he spent a month in juvenile detention. After this incident, \nApplicant\u2019s father sent him to live in Iraq with Applicant\u2019s aunt. (GE 2 at 7; GE 4; GE 3 at \n3-4; GE 4; Tr. 59-61) \nIn October 2013, Applicant was arrested for domestic assault and battery. His \nfather called the police after Applicant broke his father\u2019s car windows. Applicant\u2019s father \ntold the police that Applicant was using marijuana. Applicant was put in a juvenile home \nfor approximately one month after this incident, and the charges were ultimately \ndismissed. (GE 3 at 5; GE 4; GE 5; Tr. 60-61, 68-69) \nIn June 2014, Applicant was arrested for failure to stop after a personal injury \naccident, and failure to have insurance. Applicant struck a motorcycle and fled the scene. \nApplicant and his friend were chasing an individual who took marijuana from Applicant\u2019s \nfriend. Applicant pled guilty in 2015, after he was released from prison for the crime \nalleged in SOR allegation 2.d., and he received six months of probation. Despite his guilty \nplea, Applicant claimed he allowed his friend to drive his vehicle, and he was a passenger \nin his own vehicle. Applicant accepted responsibility for the accident because his friend \nhad a suspended license. (GE 1; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 7; GE 6; Tr. 69-77) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nIn August 2014, Applicant was charged with aggravated assault. Applicant was 17, \nand his brother, who was 14, called the 18-year-old victim multiple times until the victim \nmet Applicant, his brother, and two of their friends in a parking lot. Applicant\u2019s brother \nthrew the first punch, Applicant then punched the victim in the head, but claims he only \npunched him once, and then one of their friends punched the victim once. The victim \nsuffered a broken jaw, a broken nose, required stitches, and reconstructive surgery. \nApplicant pled not guilty. He was tried as an adult, and a jury convicted him. Applicant \nwas sentenced to 365 days in jail. He was released two months early for good behavior. \n(GE 1 at 27-28; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 4; GE 4; GE 7; Tr. 24, 77-88) \n \nIn September 2014, Applicant was arrested for driving while his license was \nsuspended, operation of a vehicle without registration plates, and no insurance. He was \nsentenced to six months of probation. He had just purchased a vehicle from Craig\u2019s List, \nand he was using a screwdriver as a key. At that time, he had a suspended license; \ntherefore, he could not obtain registration plates. The incident occurred before he was \nsentenced for the incident alleged in SOR allegation 2.d. (GE 8; Tr. 89-92) \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant was arrested due to outstanding warrants for driving while \nhis license was suspended, no registration, failure to stop after an accident, and no \ninsurance. The outstanding warrants were related to the September 2014 incident alleged \nin SOR allegation 2.c. Applicant failed to resolve these issues in SOR allegation 2.c due \nto being incarcerated for ten months. Applicant pled guilty to three of the charges, and in \nexchange the other three charges were dropped. He received six months of probation. \n(GE 4; GE 9; Tr. 92-93) \n \nIn May 2016, Applicant was pulled over and ticketed for no insurance and \nregistration violation. He had insurance and registration, but he did not have the \ndocumentation with him at the time of the traffic stop. The charges were eventually \ndismissed. (GE 10; Tr. 93) \n \nIn May 2018, Applicant was ticketed for failure to display a valid license. He did \nhave a valid license, but not on him when he was pulled over by the police. The charge \nwas dismissed. (GE 11; Tr. 93-94) \n \nApplicant has not been arrested or ticketed since 2018, and he has no unresolved \ncriminal issues. (Tr. 58, 89) \nPersonal Conduct  \nAll of the Guideline J allegations were cross alleged under Guideline E.  \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted using marijuana from 2012 until sometime in \n2014, when he went to prison for the crime alleged in SOR allegation 2.d. He used \nmarijuana approximately 20 times in his life, and he sold marijuana for six months to \nfriends. Applicant did not disclose marijuana involvement in his December 2017 SCA, in \nhis January 2018 counterintelligence screening interview (CSI), and in his February 2018 \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nsubject interview. At the hearing, he admitted to lying about his drug involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to self-report his marijuana use was not alleged in the SOR and will not \nbe considered disqualifying in the determination of his security clearance. (GE 1; GE 2 at \n11; GE 3; Tr. 62-67) \nApplicant testified that he has turned his life around in the past several years and \nno longer associates with individuals who use drugs or are involved in criminal activity. \nHe now accepts responsibility for his actions and strives to be a positive person. (Tr. 67-\n68, 76-77, 97-98) \nWhile working at the airport from 2016 to 2018, Applicant was promoted multiple \ntimes. He left this job in July 2018, because he obtained his real estate license and \nbecame a realtor. (Tr. 23-26) \nGuideline B: \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Iraq. In 1991, he fled to the United States as a \nrefugee and was subsequently naturalized. Applicant\u2019s father owns property in Iraq, and \nhe served as a linguist for a defense contractor from approximately 2007 to 2009. \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s sister and her family are citizens and residents of Iraq. (GE 1; GE 2; \nGE 3 at 2; Tr. 29-31, 37-38) \n \nApplicant does not own property or have financial assets in Iraq. Applicant lives in \nhis fianc\u00e9\u2019s home, but does not own any real estate. His assets total approximately \n$5,000. In his CSI, Applicant told the investigator that he had equal loyalties to the US \nand Iraq. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that he would not want to have to choose \nbetween the two countries, but he would choose the US over Iraq. (GE 2; Tr. 30-32) \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She lives near the Kuwait border \nand sells homemade pickles. She has never been associated with the Iraqi government. \nApplicant communicated electronically with her and his cousins once a week until \napproximately two to three years ago. (GE 3 at 3; Tr. 36-37, 44, 46-48) \nApplicant is solely a United States citizen; however, he lived in Iraq with his father \nfrom January 2003 to January 2006. They lived with his father\u2019s sister and her children. \nApplicant\u2019s father sent Applicant to Iraq to live with his aunt in January 2008, and he lived \nwith her for a year. After the arrest listed in SOR allegation 2.a, Applicant\u2019s father sent \nhim to Iraq to live with his aunt from March 2012 until December 2012. (GE 2; Tr. 21, 33-\n37, 39-43, 46)  \n \nApplicant visited Iraq for two weeks in October 2017, and stayed with his aunt for \na day. He went to Iraq for a family wedding. Applicant is not aware of his cousins having \nany ties to the Iraqi government. (GE 1 at 24; GE 2; Tr. 34, 42-43, 53) \n \n \nApplicant does not consider himself to be close to his aunt, despite living with her \nfor three significant periods during his childhood and maintaining weekly electronic \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ncommunications with her and her sons until approximately three years ago. (Tr. 48-49, \n51-52) \nIraq  \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous \nand the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. \ncitizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist \nand insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi \nsecurity forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens \nand western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)   \n  \n  \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include \npress, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. (HE I) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \n \n   \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nApplicant\u2019s eight arrests between 2012 and 2018 establish the above conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised in this case. The \nfollowing two are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nIt has been over a year since Appellant\u2019s last traffic incident. Between 2012 and \n2018, he was arrested and convicted of multiple criminal offenses, including assault \nagainst two separate individuals. His history of traffic violations, indicate a failure to follow \nrules and regulations, and demonstrate a lack of responsible behavior. Given the \nseriousness of several of the convictions and the ongoing nature of his traffic violations, \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) was not established. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that could raise a security concern and \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issues that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nthat the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s behavior since at least 2012 demonstrates questionable judgment, \nunreliability, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, establishing the \nabove condition. AG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. One condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant has not demonstrated that his behavior has significantly changed. At the \nhearing, he admitted to lying about his drug involvement in his: December 2017 SCA; \nJanuary 2018 counterintelligence screening interview (CSI); and February 2018 subject \ninterview. His failure to be honest and forthright with the government multiple times \nregarding his drug involvement, coupled with his history of criminal activity is deeply \nconcerning, and continues to reflect negatively on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Mitigation was not established under AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nApplicant has ongoing familial connections with his aunt in Iraq. Although he \ntestified that he has had no contact with her for approximately two to three years, he lived \nwith her and her family multiple times between 2003 and 2012, and he visited her in 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his aunt creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because of the risk of terrorism in Iraq. The record evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant is a natural-born citizen of the United States; as such, his ties to the \nUnited States are substantial. However, he lived in Iraq with his aunt between 2003 and \n2006, from 2008 to 2009, and for ten months in 2012. He visited her in 2017. These \ncontacts are not casual or infrequent. Additionally, he has not demonstrated that his ties \nand allegiance to Iraq are minimal, or he can be expected to resolve conflict or interest in \nfavor of the U.S. \n \nThe instability and risk of terrorism in Iraq present an unacceptable risk that \nApplicant may be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, or government and the interests of the United States. Mitigation \nwas not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns at issue. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n \n \n \n11 \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nCAROLINE E.

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/18/2020 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nOctober 30, 2017. On March 11, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 18, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On December 4, 2019, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including six \nexhibits. She was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth \nobjections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s \nevidence. She received the FORM on January 2, 2020, and timely submitted her \nresponse, to which the Government did not object. I marked for identification the six \n\n \n2 \n \nexhibits offered by the Government as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 thorough 6. GE 1 and \n2 contain the pleadings in the case. GE 3, 5, and 6 are admitted into evidence. GE 4 is \ndiscussed below. The case was assigned to me on November 26, 2019. \n \nEvidentiary Matter \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a DOD-authorized investigator on September 11, \n2018 in connection with her 2017 SCA. GE 4 is summary of the interview prepared by the \ninvestigator. GE 4 purports to be an accurate summary of the information that Applicant \nprovided to the investigator during the interview. Since GE 4 was not authenticated as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, the Government acknowledged that some of the \ninformation contained therein could be inaccurate or outdated.  \n \nThe Government included in the FORM a notice advising Applicant of her right to \nobject to the admissibility of GE 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated, to comment \non the accuracy of the information contained in the summary, and to make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, or updates necessary to make it clear and accurate. \nApplicant was also notified that if she did not raise any objection to GE 4 in her response \nto the FORM, or if she did not respond to the FORM, she could be considered to have \nwaived any such objection, and GE 4 could be considered as evidence in her case.  \n \nApplicant raised an objection to GE 4 in her FORM response on the basis that the \ninformation therein was not accurate. She asserted several specific facts that were \ninconsistent with the information discussed with the investigator during the interview. The \nGovernment did not object to Applicant\u2019s FORM response or otherwise oppose \nApplicant\u2019s objection to the admission of GE 4. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s objection to GE \n4 is sustained and it will not be considered as evidence in her case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 41, has never married nor had children. She has cohabited with her \nboyfriend since 2016. She earned a high school diploma in 1996, a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2001, and a master\u2019s degree in 2014. She has been employed as a finance director by a \ndefense contractor since July 2010. She maintained a DOD security clearance from about \n2007 or 2008 until she was laid off by her previous employer in May 2010. (GE 3) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant \u201cpurchased and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from approximately January 1998 through at least April 2017.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It \nalso alleged that her purchase and use continued to occur after she had been granted a \nsecurity clearance in approximately 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nbut clarified that she has not purchased marijuana since 2001, only used marijuana twice \nafter 2003, and has not used marijuana since April 2017. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.b on the \nbasis that she never used marijuana while having an active security clearance. (GE 2) \n \nApplicant began experimenting with marijuana and other illegal drugs during high \nschool and college. She continued to use marijuana for several years after college. She \nestimated her frequency of use as follows: cocaine, 10 times between June 1995 and \n\n \n3 \n \nJuly 2000; marijuana, 30 times between January 1998 and January 2003; and ecstasy, \ntwo times between January 1999 and December 1999. She used them in social settings, \nand received them gratis from people with whom she was socializing. She purchased \nmarijuana only on a \u201cfew\u201d occasions, and never in mass quantities or for the purpose of \nredistributing it. She stopped using marijuana in 2003 because she matured and decided \nthat it did not benefit her in anyway. After she stopped using marijuana, she intentionally \navoided situations where marijuana was present. She had no intent to use marijuana or \nother illegal drugs in the future. (GE 5 at 35-36; GE 6) \n \nApplicant used marijuana on two occasions after 2003, once while on vacation on \nan unspecified date in 2014 and once at music festival in April 2017 (for reasons not \nexplained in the record). While she was not in possession of an active security clearance \non either occasion, she was employed by a defense contractor. The record did not specify \nwhether she was subjected to any type of drug-use policy by her employer. She has not \nused marijuana or other illegal drugs since April 2017. (FORM response; GE 2; GE 3 at \n33-34) \n \nApplicant first applied for a DOD security clearance in 2005. During that process, \nshe self-reported the history of her marijuana and other illegal drug use on her 2005 SCA \nand during her 2007 security clearance interview. She was granted a clearance which \nshe maintained until she was laid off in 2010. That clearance did not transfer to her current \nemployer because she did not have a need for a security clearance. She now has a need \nfor a security clearance so her current employer is sponsoring the pending application, \nwhich was initiated in October 2017. She self-reported the history of her marijuana use \nwithin the last seven years on her 2017 SCA and candidly discussed it in her SOR answer \nand FORM response. Her 2014 and 2017 marijuana use occurred prior to her submission \nof the 2017 SCA. (FORM response; GE 2, 3, 5, 6) \n \nIn her subscribed and sworn SOR answer, Applicant reiterated her commitment to \nremain abstinent from marijuana and other illegal drugs. She provided a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of her security clearance \neligibility. She understands the seriousness of illegal drug use and that it is incompatible \nwith the maintenance of a security clearance. She has never used illegal drugs while in \npossession of an active security clearance, and would never do so. She considers herself \na steward of the U.S. government and would never do anything to jeopardize proprietary, \nsensitive, or classified information. (GE 2; FORM response) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n\n \n4 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nThe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \n \nThe SOR alleged facts that rendered the following additional disqualifying \ncondition potentially applicable: AG \u00b6 25 (f) any illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position. Applicant was granted a DOD \nsecurity clearance in about 2007 or 2008, which she maintained until she was laid off in \n2010. That clearance did not transfer to her current employer because she did not have \na need for a security clearance. She now has a need for a security clearance so her \ncurrent employer is sponsoring the pending application. Her marijuana use in 2014 and \n2017 occurred during a period when she did not possess an active security clearance. \nThus, I find that there is insufficient record evidence to apply AG \u00b6 25(f). \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \n\n \n6 \n \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant experimented with marijuana and other illegal drugs throughout high \nschool and college. Her marijuana use continued through her early twenties, when she \nstopped and expressed an intent never to use it in the future. For reasons not explained \nin the record, she used marijuana twice in her late thirties. While she was not in \npossession of an active security clearance on either occasion, she was employed by a \ndefense contractor. However, there was no evidence in the record that she was subjected \nto any type of drug-use policy by her employer.  \n \nApplicant was candid about her drug use during the security clearance process in \n2005 and 2017. She understands that illegal drug use is incompatible with maintaining a \nsecurity clearance. She has never used illegal drugs while in possession of an active \nsecurity clearance, and would never do so. She has not used marijuana in at least two \nyears. To reinforce her commitment to abstain from using marijuana or any other illegal \ndrugs in the future, she provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of her security clearance eligibility.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to use marijuana twice in her early thirties after she had been \ngranted a security clearance and been employed in the defense sector was poor \njudgment. However, the facts and circumstances of her use suggest that it is not likely to \nrecur. Moreover, she was frank about her marijuana use and demonstrated a commitment \nto abstinence. Thus, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s marijuana and other illegal drug use is \nnot likely to recur, and does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher marijuana use. Accordingly, Applicant has carried her burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-39, 46-47, 50-52; GE 1-4; AE C, D) \n \n \nApplicant stopped using marijuana by the time she completed her June 2013 SCA, \nwhich was during \u201cfinals week\u201d of her third year in college. She did not use marijuana \nduring the duration of her summer internships in 2013 and 2014. She resumed using \nmarijuana when she returned to college after completing both internships, and she also \nused marijuana once or twice after her March 2015 graduation. She held a clearance \nduring this period, having been granted one in 2013 (SOR \u00b61.d). She testified that she \nregretted doing so, but she was not thinking long-term. She has not used marijuana since \nshe began working full time in June 2015. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE \n1- 4; AE C, D) \n \n \nApplicant used ecstasy and cocaine from approximately April 2011 to July 2016 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c). She first used ecstasy during her first year in college, while at a concert \nwith her college roommate. All of her ecstasy use occurred while attending concerts. She \nalso first used cocaine during her first year in college, while at a fraternity party with her \ncollege roommate. She used cocaine occasionally throughout college, while attending \nconcerts with friends. The individuals with whom she used ecstasy and cocaine provided \n\n \n3 \n \nthem, and there were occasions in which she contributed money towards their purchase. \nShe used both ecstasy and cocaine twice after graduation; she last used ecstasy in \nJanuary 2016; and she last used cocaine in July 2016. She held a clearance during this \nperiod (SOR \u00b61.d). She decided in 2016 that she never wanted to use ecstasy or cocaine \nagain. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE 1-4; AE C, D)  \n \n \nApplicant reiterated that she regretted using marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine after \nher college graduation. She testified that though she was working full time, she did not \ncontemplate the long-term implications of using drugs while working for her employer and \nholding a security clearance. She first came to understand such implications in 2017, \nwhen she transferred to the division in which she worked as of the date of the hearing \nand underwent the security clearance process again for continued access to classified \ninformation, as further discussed below. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE 1-\n4; AE C) \n \n \nApplicant misused the prescription medication Adderall, not prescribed to her, after \nshe purchased it from friends between April and October 2011; and she misused her \nprescribed Adderall when she gifted or sold it to friends between December 2011 and \nJune 2013 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f). She first used Adderall in April 2011, prior to receiving a \nprescription for it. She was struggling in school and a friend who was prescribed it offered \nit to her as a study aid. She found that it helped her study so she used it several more \ntimes. She also purchased it for her personal use two to three times between the spring \nand fall of 2011. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 57-58; GE 1-4; AE C)  \n \n \nIn the fall of 2011, Applicant sought counseling to explore the possibility of \nreceiving her own Adderall prescription; she received such a prescription when she was \ndiagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She used her prescribed Adderall \nthroughout college. She also gifted and sold some of her Adderall pills to several friends \nduring the week of college exams. She stated in her 2017 security clearance application \n(SCA) and during her 2018 background interview that she had no intent to sell her \nprescription Adderall again in the future. She briefly stopped usage of her prescribed \nAdderall after graduation, and she resumed usage from 2016 to June 2019 while pursuing \nher master\u2019s degree. Though it helped with her learning disability, she testified that she \nhad no intention of taking it again because she did not want to have to take a drug \u201cfor \nthe rest of my life.\u201d (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 57-58; GE 1-4; AE C, D) \n \n \nApplicant was aware of her employer\u2019s policy against illegal drug use. She \nsuccessfully completed drug tests in conjunction with her internships in the summers of \n2013 and 2014, her full-time employment in 2015, and her 2017 transfer to the division in \nwhich she worked as of the date of the hearing. She was subject to random drug testing, \nbut she had not been drug tested since 2016. In June 2019, she signed a statement of \nintent not to illegally use any drugs in the future and that any violation constituted grounds \nfor revocation of her clearance. In April 2019, she was assessed by a psychiatrist and \ndetermined to not be drug dependent. (Tr. at 18-33, 38-46, 50-55, 57, 59; AE C, D, E)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has matured and her priorities have changed. She \ntestified that she socializes primarily with her coworkers \u201cbecause of our similar values.\u201d \n\n \n4 \n \nShe no longer associated with the individuals with whom she had previously used drugs, \nto include her college roommate as well as her then long-term boyfriend. She testified \nthat she terminated her relationship with her boyfriend in April 2019 because he continued \nto behave like an \u201cadolescent teenager and I wanted to be an adult, and he wasn\u2019t getting \nthere with me.\u201d Since 2016, she has been in several situations where drugs were being \nused, and she chose to leave and go home. She was remorseful about her past drug use. \nShe testified that she understood the severity of her actions, she had no intention of \nrepeating the mistakes of her adolescence, and she did not intend to jeopardize her job \nby using illegal drugs or misusing legal drugs. (Tr. at 18-33, 38-46, 50-57, 59-60; AE C, \nD, E) \n \n \nApplicant first completed an SCA in June 2013. She marked \u201cNo\u201d and failed to \ndisclose information regarding her drug use, as discussed above in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.f, in \nresponse to section 23. Section 23 inquired whether she had, in the past seven years: (1) \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances, or (2) intentionally engaged in the \nmisuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were prescribed to \nher or someone else (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b). Applicant testified that when she completed her \n2013 SCA during \u201cfinals week\u201d of her third year in college, she was \u201creally stressed out.\u201d \nShe had not yet begun her summer internship. She testified that the SCA was included \nwith her onboarding paperwork, and she did not truly understand the nature of the SCA \nor the security clearance process. She testified that she confused the SCA with her \nonboarding paperwork, stating: \n \nI didn\u2019t really honestly know the difference between my onboarding \npaperwork and the [SCA]. It kind of seemed like all one bundle of things that \nI had to do just to get an internship. So, I did receive [the SCA] at that time \nback in June or late May of 2013. But I can\u2019t really say that I recognized [the \nonboarding paperwork and the SCA] were two separate entities. \n \n(Tr. at 26-28, 31-33, 35, 37, 47-50, 55-56, 61; GE 2; AE C). \n \n \nApplicant could not recall meeting with a facility security officer (FSO), but rather \nworked on the SCA through an individual from human resources (HR) \u201cwho, frankly, \nrushed me through the process.\u201d She recalled this individual warning her that her \ninternship would be jeopardized if she did not promptly complete the SCA. She testified \nthat she thought that she would not get the internship if she answered \u201cYes\u201d to the relevant \ndrug questions, and she did not understand that her ability to obtain a security clearance \nwould be impacted. She testified that she lacked the resources to better understand that \nshe would not be punished if she told the truth. She also sought the guidance of her \nfather, an attorney, and followed his advice to mark \u201cNo\u201d in response to section 23. She \nultimately chose to not jeopardize her internship. (Tr. at 26-28, 31-33, 35, 37, 47-50, 55-\n56, 61; GE 2; AE C, D) \n \n \nApplicant self-reported information about her past drug use to her FSO in January \n2017, when she transferred to the division in which she worked as of the date of the \nhearing. In turn, her FSO completed an incident history report, as required, on the Joint \nPersonnel Adjudication System (JPAS) database. Applicant also disclosed her past drug \n\n \n5 \n \nuse information on her March 2017 SCA. She also disclosed her past drug use to her \nmanagers and coworkers. She testified that she made a mistake in not disclosing such \ninformation on her 2013 SCA, and she was \u201ctrying to own up to it and trying to correct it.\u201d \nShe acknowledged that fear kept her from disclosing her drug use sooner. As previously \ndiscussed, she reiterated that when she underwent the security clearance process again \nin 2017 for continued access to classified information, she truly understood the \nimplications of her past drug use and her failure to disclose such drug use on her 2013 \nSCA. It was then, that she \u201cknew exactly what it was that . . . was a potential for somebody \nto blackmail me . . . .\u201d She was remorseful about her failure to disclose her drug use on \nher 2013 SCA. (Tr. at 16-18, 21, 55-56, 59; GE 1, 4; AE C).  \n  \n \nApplicant testified that she loves her job and \u201creally just dove in into my career \nsince college.\u201d Her employer rated her performance as \u201cexceeded\u201d expectations in 2015 \nand \u201csignificantly exceeded\u201d expectations from 2016 to 2018. She is involved with various \nprofessional societies devoted to promoting careers in science, technology, engineering, \nand math among young adults. She also enjoys spending time outdoors, exercising, and \ncooking. Numerous character references, to include her manager from 2018 to 2019, \ncoworkers, and friends, describe her as a responsible, honest, and trustworthy individual. \n(Tr. at 18-33, 38-46, 50-57, 59-60; AE C, D, E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n\n \n6 \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 2008 to 2015, and ecstasy and cocaine from 2011 \nto 2016. She used marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine after she was granted a clearance in \n2013. She also misused prescription Adderall not prescribed to her in 2011, and her \nprescribed Adderall between 2011 and 2013. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f) are established. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \nApplicant has taken responsibility for her past drug use, to include such drug use \nthat occurred while holding a clearance. She was remorseful and understood the severity \nof her actions. She has not misused a prescription drug since 2013 and she has not used \nillegal drugs since 2016. She disassociated herself from the individuals with whom she \npreviously used illegal drugs or misused legal drugs, to include her then long-term \nboyfriend as well as her college roommate. She has also changed her social environment. \nThe several instances in which she found herself in a setting where drugs were being \nused, she chose to leave. She also provided a signed statement of intent in June 2019. I \nfind that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are applicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n\n \n8 \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \nApplicant displayed untrustworthiness, questionable judgment, and unreliability \nwhen she chose not to list her relevant misuse of a legal drug and use of illegal drugs, to \ninclude her drug use after she was granted a clearance in 2013, on her 2013 SCA. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(e)(1) are established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \u00b6 AG 17 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant self-reported information about her past drug use to her FSO in January \n2017 and on her March 2017 SCA. She also disclosed her past drug use to her family, \nfriends, managers and coworkers. She made such disclosures because she understood \nthe implications of her past drug use and her failure to disclose such drug use on her \n2013 SCA. She was remorseful and understood the severity of failing to properly disclose \nher drug use on her 2013 SCA. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 AG 17(a), 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are \nestablished. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant was credible, candid, and \nremorseful at her hearing. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns involving personal conduct and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.F:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a security \nclearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He is close to his mother, and a retired Pakistan colonel is his \u201cbest friend.\u201d His \nmother and the retired Pakistan colonel are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Applicant \nserved 24 years in the Pakistan Army, and he is receiving a pension from the Pakistan \ngovernment. He and his spouse have property in Pakistan. His connections to Pakistan \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. Foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.        \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn July 12, 2018, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn June 12, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017.

Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B (foreign influence). (HE 2) On \nAugust 31, 2019, and October 26, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested \na hearing. (HE 3)  \n \nOn December 4, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On December \n18, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On January 17, 2020, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice, setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for February \n5, 2020. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits (GE 1-3); Applicant \ndid not offer any exhibits; there were no objections to GEs 1-3; and all proffered exhibits \nwere admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19) On February 19, 2020, DOHA \nreceived a transcript of the hearing.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Pakistan. (Tr. 19; \nGE 4) Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of those facts concerning \nPakistan, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 19) Administrative or official \nnotice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR \nCase No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice \nat ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice). Most of Department Counsel\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice is quoted without quotation marks and footnotes in the Pakistan \nsection of this decision.  \n \nSome details in this case were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. \nSpecific information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all SOR allegations. (Tr. 20; HE 3) He \nalso provided extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted \nas findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old linguist who intends to return to Afghanistan to continue \nto support U.S. operations. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) He was born in Pakistan. (Tr. 20-21; GE 1) In \n1980, he graduated from high school in Pakistan. (Tr. 6) In 1984, he received a bachelor\u2019s \n\n \n3                                        \n \n \ndegree in Pakistan. (Tr. 6, 21; GE 1) In 2010, he immigrated to the United States from \nPakistan along with his spouse and children. (Tr. 28, 114; HE 3 at 6)  \n \nFrom July 2011 to April 2013, Applicant served as a linguist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 7, \n29; GE 1) His support of the U.S. military exposed him to a risk of injury or death from \ncombat. (Tr. 31-32) For example, around 2012, an improvised explosive device (IED) \nexploded near his Stryker vehicle, and he and other vehicle occupants were tossed around \ninside the vehicle, but Applicant was not injured. (Tr. 45) In January 2019, he returned to \nAfghanistan as a linguist supporting the United States. (Tr. 7, 40, 43-44) Two days before \nhis February 5, 2020 hearing, he returned to the United States, and he planned to return \nto Afghanistan the day after his hearing. (Tr. 42) There is no evidence of criminal offenses, \nuse of illegal drugs, delinquent debts, or security violations. (GE 1) \n \nIn 1987, Applicant married in Pakistan. (Tr. 51; GE 1) His three children were born \nin Pakistan in 1991, 1992, and 1995. (GE 1) In 2016, Applicant, his spouse, and his two \nyoungest children were naturalized as U.S. citizens. (Tr. 28, 55; GE 1; GE 3) His oldest \nson became a U.S. citizen in 2019. (Tr. 56-57) Applicant\u2019s three children and one \ngrandchild live in the United States. (Tr. 51; GE 1) Applicant\u2019s spouse is employed in a \nbabysitting service. (Tr. 54) \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.h, allege Applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and sister-in-law (A) are \ncitizens and residents of Pakistan. SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse owns a home in \nPakistan. Applicant\u2019s mother is 90 years old, and she uses a wheelchair. (Tr. 74-75) She \nis unable to travel because she had a stroke, and her medical condition is \u201cdeclining.\u201d (Tr. \n74-75; HE 3 at 3, 10; GE 1) He provides financial support to his mother. (Tr. 75) His sister \nis a homemaker. (Tr. 82; HE 3 at 4, 11) Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents passed away, and \nApplicant\u2019s spouse inherited a home in Pakistan from her father valued at about $125,000. \n(Tr. 71-73; HE 3 at 8, 15) Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law A is partially disabled, and she resides \nwith two children in Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s Pakistan home. (Tr. 71-72, 100-103; HE 3 at 6, \n13) Applicant\u2019s spouse visits her sister A every year when possible. (Tr. 103; HE 3 at 6) \nApplicant has weekly and sometimes daily contact with his mother, bi-monthly contact with \nhis sister, and quarterly contact with his sister-in-law A. (Tr. 76, 82-83, 103; GE 1)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant\u2019s brother (S) is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. From \n1971 to 2000, brother S served in the Pakistan army, and he retired at the rank of \nlieutenant colonel. (Tr. 77-78) He currently works for a company connected with the \nPakistan government. (HE 3 at 4, 11) Applicant communicates with his brother S about \nevery two to three months. (Tr. 77-78)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e allege Applicant\u2019s brother (I), his sister-in-law  (R), his brother\u2019s \nson-in-law (B), and Applicant\u2019s nephew (I) are citizens and residents of Pakistan, and they \nwork for the Pakistan government. (Tr. 84-85; HE 3 at 4, 11) Brother I lives with Applicant\u2019s \nmother. (Tr. 79) Brother I has worked for a government health agency for more than 20 \nyears. (Tr. 78) Brother I does not work for the military, and he does not have a political \nposition. (HE 3 at 4) Applicant communicates with his brother I about twice a year. (Tr. 80-\n\n \n4                                        \n \n \n82) Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law R and nephew I are no longer employed by the Pakistan \ngovernment. (Tr. 85-87) Sister-in-law R has been a homemaker for several years, and his \nbrother\u2019s son-in-law B works for an educational institution. (Tr. 85-88) Applicant \ncommunicates with his sister-in-law R, his brother\u2019s son-in-law B, and his nephew I when \nhe visits Pakistan, and he does not contact them on a regular basis. (Tr. 88-89; HE 3 at 4, \n11-12)  \n  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g allege Applicant\u2019s friends N, K, and I are citizens and residents \nof Pakistan. They are all retired from the Pakistan military. Friend N served in the Pakistan \narmy from 1986 to 2016 and retired as a colonel. (Tr. 89-91) Friend K and Applicant served \nin the same infantry unit, and friend K retired from the Pakistan army as a major. (Tr. 92-\n94) Friend I served in the Pakistan military from 1985 to 2015, and he retired as a colonel. \n(Tr. 96) Friend I currently has important Pakistan government employment. (Tr. 98) Friend \nI and Applicant often served together in the Pakistan army. (Tr. 96-98) Applicant \ncommunicates with friends N and K about once a year; however, he is no longer close to \nthem. (Tr. 89-94; HE 3 at 5, 12) He does not communicate with them now because he is \nin Afghanistan. (Tr. 93) He described friend I as his \u201cbest friend,\u201d and he communicates \nwith friend I on a weekly basis. (Tr. 98; HE 3 at 5, 12) Applicant\u2019s spouse and Friend I\u2019s \nspouses are close friends. (Tr. 99) He most recently met with friend I when he went to \nPakistan in 2017. (Tr. 100) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges and Applicant admitted that Applicant served in the Pakistan \nmilitary from 1985 to 2009; he retired as a major; and he receives a monthly pension from \nthe Pakistan military of about $400. (Tr. 7-8, 21; HE 3 at 6, 13, 62-63) He was \ncommissioned in the infantry. (Tr. 8, 21) He served the last 10 years of his Pakistan army \ncareer as an instructor. (Tr. 24-25) He decided to leave active duty because he had a \nmedical problem. (Tr. 24) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m allege Applicant owns in Pakistan: (1) property valued at \nabout $100,000; (2) a bank account with about $3,000 on deposit; and (3) a bank account \nwith about $500 on deposit. The value of his land in Pakistan has varied from about \n$40,000 to about $100,000 depending on a variety of economic factors. (Tr. 70-71) One \nbank account currently has about $4,500 on deposit, and amount changes because his \nretired pay is deposited in the account by the Pakistan government. (Tr. 64, 115-116) He \nand his family use the funds in the accounts when they visit Pakistan. (HE 3 at 7) They \ntransfer excess funds to his United States accounts. (HE 3 at 7, 8, 14) Applicant inherited \nthe land valued at about $40,000 to about $100,000 from his father. (Tr. 66-67; HE 3 at 7, \n14) He intends to divide the land inheritance between his three sons. (Tr. 69; HE 3 at 7) \nApplicant\u2019s brother S currently farms Applicant\u2019s land in Pakistan. (Tr. 66-69; HE 3 at 7) \nAround 2013, Applicant sold all of his other property in Pakistan except for the land in SOR \n\u00b6 1.j, and he transferred about $80,000 to the United States. (HE 3 at 9, 15-16) He used \nmost of the funds from the sale of this property in Pakistan to purchase a house in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 34-35, 52-53) He spent some of the $80,000 to support his family in \nPakistan. Applicant has about $60,000 equity in his house in the United States. (Tr. 53)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family knows he is applying for a security clearance; \nhowever, his family in Pakistan is not aware of the specifics of his employment. (Tr. 46-\n\n \n5                                        \n \n \n47) He told them that he is a civil engineer. (Tr. 46-47) He did not tell them he is serving \nin Afghanistan. (Tr. 46-47) \n \nApplicant traveled to Pakistan twice in 2013, once in 2014, once in 2016, and twice \nin 2017. (Tr. 57-60; GE 1) He typically stayed in Pakistan for 10 to 30 days on each trip. \n(Tr. 57-60) Several visits were to support one of his siblings and his mother because of \ntheir medical issues. (Tr. 57-60) He is nervous about visiting Pakistan because of \nsensitivities in that country in the areas of religion and politics. (Tr. 27) Freedom of speech \nin Pakistan is limited and making comments about religion and politics or support of the \nUnited States is risky. (Tr. 27) He avoids attending public gatherings in Pakistan. (Tr. 111) \nApplicant did not renounce his Pakistan citizenship because Pakistan does not recognize \nrenunciation of citizenship for persons born in Pakistan. (Tr. 28) He retains his Pakistan \npassport because his mother may have a health emergency, and he does not want to have \na delay in his travel. (Tr. 29) He occasionally sends money to friends and family living in \nPakistan. (Tr. 106-109) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother-in-law served in the U.S. Army for 30 years, and he is \na successful businessman in the United States. (Tr. 118)  Applicant describes himself as \nhonest, loyal to the United States, and determined to protect U.S. national security. (Tr. \n116-120; HE 3 at 10) He is proud to be a U.S. citizen and to support the U.S. military. (Tr. \n110) He is adamant that he would resist any attempt at coercion and unlawful influence. \n(HE 3 at 10) He is happy about his life in the United States, and he does not intend to \nleave the United States and return to settle in Pakistan. (Tr. 117-118; HE 3 at 16)  \n \nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan) \n \nThe separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West \nand East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved; India and \nPakistan fought two wars and a limited conflict (in 1947-48, 1965, and 1999 respectively) \nover the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which \nIndia assisted an indigenous movement reacting to the marginalization of Bengalis in \nPakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh.  \n \nThe Department of State travel advisory for Pakistan is Level 3: Reconsider Travel \nto Pakistan due to terrorism. Four areas of the country (Balochistan Province, KPK \nProvince, Azad Kashmir, and the India Pakistan Border) are at Level 4: Do Not Travel. \n \nPakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. In July 2018 the Pakistan Tehreek-e-\nInsaf (PTI) party won the most National Assembly seats in the general elections, and in \nAugust 2018, PTI\u2019s Imran Khan became prime minister. \n \nSince 2001, U.S. policy has broadly been to assist the creation of a more stable, \ndemocratic, and prosperous Pakistan that actively combats religious militancy. A key U.S. \nally in combatting terrorism after 9/11, Pakistan had been a leading recipient of U.S. \nassistance, receiving more than $30 billion in aid and military reimbursements since 2001.  \n \n\n \n6                                        \n \n \nIn January 2019, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence told a Senate panel of \n\u201cPakistan\u2019s recalcitrance in dealing with militant groups,\u201d and predicted Pakistan will \ncontinue to threaten U.S. interests \u201cby deploying new nuclear weapons capabilities, \nmaintaining its ties to militants, restricting counterterrorism cooperation, and drawing \ncloser to China.\u201d Pakistan is a haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups, \nand successive Pakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even \nsupported some of these as proxies in Islamabad\u2019s historical conflicts with its neighbors. \n \nAlthough the Pakistani government voiced support for political reconciliation \nbetween the Afghan government and the Afghan Taliban, it did not restrict the Afghan \nTaliban and the Haqqani Network (HQN) from operating in Pakistan-based safe havens \nand threatening U.S. and Afghan forces in Afghanistan. The government failed to \nsignificantly limit Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) from raising \nmoney, recruiting, and training in Pakistan - and allowed candidates overtly affiliated with \nLeT front organizations to contest the July general elections.  \n \nPakistan experienced significant terrorist threats in 2018, although the number of \nattacks and casualties have continued to decrease from previous years. The major \nterrorist groups that focused on conducting attacks in Pakistan included Tehrik-e-Taliban \nPakistan (TTP), Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), Islamic State\u2019s Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), and \nthe sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Alami (LJA). ISIS-K claimed several major \nattacks against Pakistani targets, some of which may have been conducted in \ncollaboration with other terrorist groups. Separatist militant groups conducted terrorist \nattacks against governmental, non-governmental, and diplomatic targets in Balochistan \nand Sindh provinces. Groups located in Pakistan, but focused on conducting attacks \noutside the country, included the Afghan Taliban, HQN, LeT and its affiliated front \norganizations, and JeM. Terrorists used a range of tactics to attack individuals, schools, \nmarkets, government institutions, and places of worship, including IEDs, VBIEDs, suicide \nbombings, targeted assassinations, and rocket-propelled grenades.  \n \nTerrorist Incidents: Pakistan has experienced numerous recent terrorist attacks. \nMilitant and terrorist groups targeted civilians, journalists, community leaders, security \nforces, law enforcement agents, and schools, killing and injuring hundreds. Religious \nminorities faced significant threats from terrorist groups.  \n \n*  *  * \n \nTerrorist financing networks in Pakistan have come under scrutiny. In early 2018, \nthe United States joined Britain in urging other members of the Paris-based Financial \nAction Task Force (FATF) to return Pakistan to its list of countries found to be insufficiently \ncombating money laundering and terrorism financing, where it had been listed from 2012 \nto 2015. In mid-2018, FATF formally added Pakistan to this \u201cGray List.\u201d \n \nHuman rights issues in Pakistan include credible reports of extrajudicial and \ntargeted killings; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary and lengthy pretrial detention; \narbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; censorship, site-blocking, and arbitrary \nrestrictions on journalists\u2019 freedom of movement; severe harassment and intimidation of \n\n \n7                                        \n \n \nand high profile attacks against journalists and media organizations; government \nrestrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly and association, including overly restrictive \nnongovernmental organizations (NGO) laws; restrictions on religious freedom and \ndiscrimination against members of religious minority groups; restrictions on freedom of \nmovement; corruption within the government; recruitment and use of child soldiers by \nnon-state militant groups; lack of criminal investigations or accountability for cases related \nto rape, sexual harassment, so-called honor crimes, female genital mutilation/cutting, and \nviolence based on gender, gender identity and sexual orientation; legal prohibitions of \nconsensual same-sex sexual conduct; forced and bonded labor and transnational \ntrafficking in persons; and the worst forms of child labor. \n \nIn early 2017, after Pakistan\u2019s military announced the nationwide Radd-ul-Fasaad \nor \u201cElimination of Strife\u201d operation to prevent cross-border terrorist attacks and limit \nmilitants\u2019 access to explosives and weapons, government and military sources reported \nscores of military and police operations to disarm, disrupt, kill, and apprehend terrorists. \nMilitary courts operated without transparency and sentenced at least 104 convicted \nterrorists to death in 2018, up from at least 15 in 2017. \n \nThe Pakistani military and intelligence services nominally reported to civilian \nauthorities but essentially operated without effective civilian oversight. There was a lack \nof government accountability, and abuses often went unpunished, fostering a culture of \nimpunity among the perpetrators, whether official or unofficial. Authorities seldom \npunished government officials for human rights abuses. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n8                                        \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cIt means such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971) (citation omitted). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \n\n \n9                                        \n \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, two brothers, one sister, two sisters-in-law, one brother\u2019s son-\nin-law, one nephew, and three friends are citizens and residents of Pakistan. From 1985 \nto 2009, Applicant served in the Pakistan army, and he is receiving a $400 monthly \npension from the Pakistan government. He and his spouse own land in Pakistan, and \nApplicant has two bank accounts in Pakistan. Applicant admitted all of these SOR \nallegations. \n   \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a foreign country \nis not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his \nor her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \n\n \n10                                        \n \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002)).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government are \namong the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-\n02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). \nAnother important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with \nthe United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Pakistan \nwith the United States and the situation in Pakistan place a significant burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with any family member or \nfriend living in or visiting Pakistan do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be \nplaced into a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United \nStates and concerns about assisting someone living in or visiting Pakistan.  \n \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 \nn. 18 (App. Bd. July 28, 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on \ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an \napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign \ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a \npotential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to exploit in an effort \nto get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an applicant  \n-- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, \nor through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile \nto the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \n\n \n11                                        \n \n \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at \n5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical \nfields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. \n27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing \nTaiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in Pakistan seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Pakistan has a significant problem \nwith terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in that country \u201ccould be a means through \nwhich Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology \nand who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with people who are living in Pakistan or visiting that \ncountry create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on \nthose living in Pakistan in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified \ninformation. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced \nsubstantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with people living in Pakistan and \nproperty in Pakistan and has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about \npotential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n\n \n12                                        \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nAs indicated in the disqualifying conditions section, Applicant has several relatives \nand three friends who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Applicant retired from the \nPakistan army as a major, and he is receiving a $400 monthly pension from the Pakistan \ngovernment. He and his spouse own land in Pakistan, and Applicant has two bank \naccounts in Pakistan.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege: (1) Applicant, his spouse, and his three children \nwere born in Pakistan; (2) his spouse traveled to Pakistan almost every year for several \nyears; (3) Applicant retains a Pakistan passport to facilitate visits to Pakistan; (4) \nApplicant traveled to Pakistan twice in 2013, once in 2014, once in 2016, and twice in \n2017; and (5) when he traveled to Pakistan, he typically stayed in Pakistan for 10 to 30 \ndays. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed \nfive circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \n\n \n13                                        \n \n \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \n \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or more frequently \nconstitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent and stating \u201cThe frequency with which Applicant speaks to his family members \nin Iran does not diminish the strength of his family ties.\u201d). Applicant has frequent contact \nwith several relatives who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. He has weekly and \nsometimes daily contact with his mother, bi-monthly contact with his sister, and quarterly \ncontact with sister-in-law A. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.h) He described friend I as his \u201cbest \nfriend,\u201d and he often communicates with friend I on a weekly basis. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \nApplicant is credited with mitigating the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and \n1.m. He communicates with his brother S about every two to three months, and with \nbrother I about twice a year. He rarely communicates with his sister-in-law R, nephew I, \nand brother\u2019s son-in-law B. Applicant communicates with friends N and K about once a \nyear. His bank account with about $500 on deposit is too insignificant compared to his \noverall net worth to cause a security concern.  \n \nEven so, Applicant has significant financial connections to Pakistan. He owns land \nvalued at about $40,000 to $100,000, has a bank account with about $4,500 on deposit, \nand receives a $400 monthly pension for his 24 years of service in the Pakistan Army. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, and 1.l) His spouse owns a home in Pakistan valued at about $125,000. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k) The value of his and his spouse\u2019s property in Pakistan exceeds the value of \nhis property in the United States. \n   \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant connections to the United \nStates. Applicant, his wife, and his three children are citizens and residents of the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother-in-law served in the U.S. Army for 30 years, and he \nis a successful businessman in the United States. Applicant owns property in the United \nStates. Applicant and his spouse have U.S. employment. Applicant intends to permanently \nreside in the United States.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Afghanistan, including the dangers that service \nentailed, weighs heavily towards mitigation of security concerns. Applicant seeks a \nsecurity clearance to enable him to continue providing assistance to DOD. He has shown \n\n \n14                                        \n \n \nhis patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his support to DOD while \nserving in Afghanistan. In ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the \nAppeal Board cogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United \nStates: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to support \na favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in support of U.S. \nforces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous high-risk \ncircumstances in which [he] made a significant contribution to national \nsecurity.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008); and ISCR Case \nNo. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in the Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s support to DOD contributes to the \naccomplishment of DOD\u2019s goals and missions in Afghanistan. In addition, Pakistan is a \nkey U.S. ally in combatting terrorism after 9/11, and Pakistan had been a leading recipient \nof U.S. assistance, receiving more than $30 billion in aid and military reimbursements \nsince 2001.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Pakistan. Applicant has close relationships with family and a friend in \nthat country, and they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of \nthe Pakistan government. Applicant\u2019s access to classified information could theoretically \nadd risk to his relatives living in Pakistan.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives and a retired colonel in the Pakistan \narmy (friend I) who are living in Pakistan combined with his military service to Pakistan \nand his and his spouse\u2019s property ownership in Pakistan are too significant to mitigate \nbased on the circumstances Applicant presented. His connections to the United States \ntaken together, while important, are not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n15                                        \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old linguist who intends to return to Afghanistan to support \nU.S. operations. In 1984, and he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. In 2010, he immigrated to \nthe United States from Pakistan along with his spouse and children. He honorably served \nin Afghanistan, where he risked injury or death in support of the United States mission. He \nhonestly and sincerely described his love and support for the United States. He intends to \npermanently reside in the United States. There is no evidence of criminal offenses, use of \nillegal drugs, delinquent debts, or violation of security rules or responsibilities while serving \nwith U.S. forces in Afghanistan. See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, \n2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d but commenting that security \nconcerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Pakistan must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers in that country. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical \nsituation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Pakistan is a dangerous \nplace because of violence from terrorists and criminals, and the Pakistan government \ndoes not respect the full spectrum of human rights. Terrorists and criminals in Pakistan \ncontinue to threaten the interests of the United States and those who cooperate and assist \nthe United States.   \n \nApplicant has a close relationship with his mother, and he provides some financial \nsupport to her. He also maintains close relationships with citizens and residents of \nPakistan including other relatives and friend I. Applicant\u2019s 24 years of military service to \nPakistan demonstrated his close bond to Pakistan. His connections to and support for \nfamily and friends in Pakistan exemplify good character traits including loyalty to family \nand friends. \n \nApplicant cannot control his family members\u2019 decisions to live and work in their \nnative Pakistan. While there is nothing untoward about his relationships and contacts with \nhis family members in Pakistan, his present circumstances are such that he could be \nplaced in an untenable position of having to choose between the interests of a loved one \nand the United States. \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family \nmember.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) (reversing grant of \n\n \n16                                        \n \n \nsecurity clearance because of Applicant\u2019s connections to his brother, a Nigerian official). \nBased on the facts and circumstances before me, concerns of undue foreign influence \npersist. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g through 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of March 8, 2019, Applicant was past due $30,698 on a mortgage loan with a $158,242 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he owed three charged-off credit-card debts totaling $4,460 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d); two collection debts of $742 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $484 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a defaulted student-loan debt of $472 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and four medical debts totaling $790 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.k). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the allegations without explanation. His admissions are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 32 years old and divorced. He and his ex-wife married in July 2012 and were divorced in December 2016. They have a seven-year-old son. Applicant adopted her two sons, who are now ages 10 and 11. (GE 1: Tr. 32.) Applicant has been working as a field service technician for his current employer, a defense contractor, since August 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 19-20.) He previously worked as a marine electrician for another defense contractor from March 2013 to August 2017. (GE 1.) He does not currently hold a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 20.) Applicant attended an out-of-state university for one semester, from September 2008 to December 2008. (GE 1.) He obtained two federal student loans for $1,750 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and $1,000 (not alleged in SOR), in September 2008. His loans were current through May 2017, when",

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nOn April 29, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. His response was considered incomplete because he had \nnot answered SOR \u00b6 1.j. On July 16, 2019, Applicant submitted a response, admitting to all \nthe allegations in the SOR, and he requested a hearing before an administrative judge \nfrom the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On August 14, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel indicated that the Government was prepared to proceed to a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 20, 2019, and I received the case file on August \n27, 2019. Applicant was not available for a hearing in September 2019 with other cases in \nhis area. Scheduling his hearing was delayed pending Department Counsel being prepared \nto proceed on sufficient cases in the region to justify the expense of travel for the \nGovernment. On January 24, 2020, Department Counsel indicated that the case could be \nscheduled with other matters for the week of March 2, 2020. On February 3, 2020, I \nscheduled a hearing for March 5, 2020. \n \nAt the hearing, the Government submitted four exhibits (GEs 1-4), which were \naccepted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing \ntranscript received on March 14, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of March 8, 2019, Applicant was past \ndue $30,698 on a mortgage loan with a $158,242 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he owed \nthree charged-off credit-card debts totaling $4,460 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d); two collection debts \nof $742 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $484 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a defaulted student-loan debt of $472 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g); and four medical debts totaling $790 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.k). When Applicant answered the \nSOR, he admitted the allegations without explanation. His admissions are accepted and \nincorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing \ntranscript, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and divorced. He and his ex-wife married in July 2012 and \nwere divorced in December 2016. They have a seven-year-old son. Applicant adopted her \ntwo sons, who are now ages 10 and 11. (GE 1: Tr. 32.) Applicant has been working as a \nfield service technician for his current employer, a defense contractor, since August 2017. \n(GE 1; Tr. 19-20.) He previously worked as a marine electrician for another defense \ncontractor from March 2013 to August 2017. (GE 1.) He does not currently hold a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 20.) \n \nApplicant attended an out-of-state university for one semester, from September \n2008 to December 2008. (GE 1.) He obtained two federal student loans for $1,750 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g) and $1,000 (not alleged in SOR), in September 2008. His loans were current through \nMay 2017, when he ceased paying them. (GE 3; Tr. 31.) He transferred to an in-state \nuniversity near his home in January 2009, but did not finish the semester. He began \nstudies at a marine academy in March 2013 and earned his associate\u2019s degree in \nDecember 2016. (GE 1.) He did not obtain any student loans for that schooling because it \nwas a company-paid apprenticeship. (Tr. 36.) \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant worked as an assistant manager at a convenience store earning $10 an \nhour from August 2010 to November 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 41.) After the birth of his son in \nSeptember 2012, he was unable to work the hours needed to maintain his employment. He \nthen worked as a part-time cook until January 2012, when he took off a few months to \nspend time with his family. (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant has lived at his address residence since September 2011. In February \n2016, he purchased the property, a three-unit apartment building, for $140,000 from his \nthen wife\u2019s parents. (GE 3; Tr. 23, 38.) He obtained a mortgage loan of $137,362. In April \n2016, his loan was acquired by the lender in SOR \u00b6 1.a. His monthly repayment term was \n$1,220 per month. When he purchased the property, two of the units were occupied, and \nthe renters stayed on, paying him rent of $600 monthly per unit. (Tr. 38, 51.) His ex-wife \nhandled most of the bills during their marriage. She made the mortgage payments through \nJuly 2016, but then stopped paying, initially without his knowledge. (GE 1; Tr. 43, 51-52.) \nAs of September 2017, his loan was $12,688 past due on a balance of $144,468. (GE 3.) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife relied on consumer credit for purchases, even before they \nmarried. During their marriage, his ex-wife incurred some credit-card debt in his name \nwithout his knowledge. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 29, 33.) Applicant admits that he lost control of the \nhousehold budgeting. (Tr. 18.) Their debts began to accumulate in 2013, following the birth \nof their son in September 2012, and a period of voluntary unemployment from January \n2013 to March 2013, before he started working in the defense industry at $24 an hour \n($45,000 to $50,000 annually) in March 2013. (GE 1; Tr. 32, 42-43.) He became \u201ca little \noverwhelmed\u201d with going from being single to having a wife and three children to support. \n(Tr. 33.) His ex-wife also incurred expenses taking their children on vacations outside their \nstate. Applicant believes that his ex-wife\u2019s depression contributed to some of their financial \nproblems. (Tr. 39-40.) \n \nApplicant is being sponsored by his employer for a security clearance so that he can \ntravel and work on jobs that require a clearance. (Tr. 20.) On October 16, 2017, Applicant \ncompleted and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86). He responded affirmatively to SF 86 financial record inquiries concerning \ndelinquency involving routine accounts and indicated that he owed approximately $5,000 in \ncredit card debt because his \u201cex-wife maxed out multiple credit cards.\u201d He also reported \nthat his mortgage was approximately $15,000 past due, and explained that he had been \nunaware that his ex-wife was not making the mortgage payments. As for efforts to resolve \nhis debts, his mortgage lender was reviewing paperwork \u201cto come to a solution\u201d for that \ndebt. He expressed his intent to consolidate his credit-card debts after his mortgage is \nback on track. (GE 1.) \n \n \nAs of October 26, 2017, Applicant\u2019s credit report revealed that his mortgage was \npast due for $12,688 with a $144,468 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that his two student loans \nobtained in September 2008 were past due for $167 with a $441 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and \n$133 with a $350 balance (not alleged). (GE 3.) Applicant owed delinquent credit-card \nbalances of $2,108 (account opened in March 2016 and charged off in February 2017) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); $1,523 (account opened in October 2015 and in collection with last payment \n\n4 \n \nin July 2016) (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $829 (account opened in July 2016 and charged off in March \n2017) (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and $483 (account opened in June 2016 and in collection with last \npayment in March 2017) (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Medical debts of $348 from March 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); \n$208 from August 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and $50 from September 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) were in \ncollection. (GE 3.) \n \n \nOn October 3, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) about his finances. Applicant described his \nfinancial situation as \u201cscrewed\u201d due to his inability to responsibly manage his financial \nresponsibilities. He related that his mortgage loan was more than $20,000 past due and in \n\u201cpre-foreclosure status.\u201d He had asked that some payments be deferred, but his lender \nwas demanding payment in full of the past-due amount. He explained that his financial \nissues arose before his divorce, when he discovered that his then wife had not been paying \ntheir bills. Additionally, she had obtained and used credit cards without his knowledge and \nconsequently, they became financially overextended. Applicant indicated that he took full \nresponsibility for repaying their marital debt on their divorce to avoid any child custody \nissues and that he is required to pay $1,040 per month in child support. \n \n \nApplicant volunteered that he had some rental income from one unit in his property. \nHe was living in one unit and his ex-wife and their children was living in the other unit, \nwithout having to pay any rent or utilities. When asked specifically about other debt issues, \nApplicant responded that there were so many that it was difficult to know who was owed \nwhat. When confronted with the adverse financial information on his credit record, \nApplicant explained that the three medical debts in collection were for his children\u2019s \nhealthcare. He did not dispute the student loans, which he mistakenly indicated had been \nincurred for his study at the maritime academy, and acknowledged that he had not \nattempted to repay them, although he planned to at some time in the future.  Applicant did \nnot recognize several credit card accounts that had been settled or paid after being \ncharged off or placed for collection, although when asked about those settlements during \nhis March 2020 hearing, Applicant responded that he and his ex-wife settled them together. \n(Tr. 59.) Applicant did not recognize the charged-off credit cards for $2,108 and $829 \nduring his OPM interview. Applicant reiterated that he had become overwhelmed about his \ncurrent financial difficulties and can only resolve one debt at a time. He planned to pay his \ndebts at some future date, but had not contacted his creditors or attempted repayment \nplans. \n \n \nSometime between the fall of 2018 and spring 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife and children \nmoved in with him because he rented out their apartment unit. (Tr. 50.) Despite rental \nincome of $1,200 per month from the two apartments, Applicant\u2019s mortgage loan was \n$30,698 past due on a balance of $158,242 as of February 2019. (GE 4; Tr. 24.) As to why \nhe fell so far behind on his loan, given that his rental income almost covered his monthly \nmortgage obligation, Applicant responded: \n \nWell, like I was saying, the mortgage got so far behind. And one of the \nstipulations with the FHA loan was that you have to pay half the past-due \namount. So once we got about $15,000 past due, that would mean I would \n\n5 \n \nhave to pay $7,500 a month and then pay the other half the next month. (Tr. \n51.) \n \n \nBy February 2019, Applicant had also made no progress on resolving the delinquent \ncredit-card balances or the student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He asserts that he paid off one of \nhis student loans (Tr. 32), and the $1,000 student loan (not alleged in the SOR) was not \nlisted as a delinquent debt on his February 2019 credit report. (GE 4.) His credit report \nincluded two previously unreported delinquencies: a $742 consumer-credit debt from July \n2016 in collection since June 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $184 medical debt from May 2018 in \ncollection since October 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant had no new consumer-credit accounts \non his credit record. (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn December 2019, Applicant had a mediation session with his lender about his \ndelinquent mortgage loan. His lender decided to proceed with the foreclosure action on his \nmortgage. As of March 2020, Applicant was awaiting a trial date. Applicant stopped \ncharging his tenants rent in October or November 2019 when it became clear that he would \nnot be able to resolve his delinquent mortgage. (Tr. 22-25, 40-41, 51.) He did not think it \nwas right to charge rent when he was not making any payments on the mortgage loan. He \nhas yet to inform his tenants that his loan is in foreclosure proceedings, although they know \nhe was having issues with his mortgage. (Tr. 26.) Applicant has been led to understand \nthat the foreclosure will likely happen. He believes that his mortgage lender will then likely \nlist the property for sale, and he will be liable for any deficiency balance on his loan. (Tr. \n27.) \n \n \nIn lieu of paying child support, Applicant allows his ex-wife access to his checking \naccount. (Tr. 47.) She continues to handle their household bills. (Tr. 54.)  She has not \nworked outside of the home since they married in 2012 and is financially dependent on \nhim. (Tr. 28, 43.)  He understands that he is legally responsible for repaying the credit-card \ndebt incurred by his ex-spouse on his credit cards. He continues to receive collection \nnotices for some of his debts. As of March 2020, Applicant had not reached out to resolve \nthe student loan, credit card, or medical delinquencies listed in the SOR. (Tr. 29-30, 33.) \nHe explained his failure to be more proactive about resolving the issues of known concern \nto the DOD as follows: \n \nHonestly, I want to maintain a relationship with my children. I love my kids \nvery much. And I get worried that [his ex-wife] will go elsewhere where I \nwould not be able to see my children. (Tr. 55.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his ex-wife has threatened to move his children out of state \nand that it has been his goal to try and put his ex-wife in a situation where she can be \nresponsible for herself and he can maintain a good relationship with his children. In that \nregard, he recommended to his ex-wife that she pursue counseling. She went only for a \nshort time, but she has been taking prescription medication for her depression for the past \ntwo or three months. (Tr. 55-56.) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant is a salaried employee earning about $65,000 annually with overtime. (Tr. \n42.) His take-home pay ranges from $2,000 to $3,000 every two weeks. His pay fluctuates \nbecause of overtime and travel. Applicant owns two vehicles, a van and a sedan, both \npurchased used, that are paid for. Most of his income goes to expenses for his three \nchildren, food, and utilities (heating oil, electricity, and Internet). He pays about $800 a \nmonth for utilities. (Tr. 35-36.) He has between $1,000 and $2,000 in his checking account, \nbut nothing in savings (Tr. 36), and lives paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 59.) Applicant received \na tax refund of $3,000 to $4,000 for tax year 2019. He used the money to pay off a couple \nof loans that he and his ex-wife had taken out between them. (Tr. 37.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties have been exacerbated in part by his ex-wife \ncontinuing to take frequent vacation trips. Sometime in 2019, she took their children to Italy \n\u201con a whim.\u201d (Tr. 44.) She has also signed his name without his knowledge on some credit-\ncard charges. (Tr. 45.) Applicant tried to cut off her access to his money, but he was \nfocused on his children\u2019s well-being, and did not think she could care of their children or \nherself. (Tr. 46.) He has had several discussions with his ex-wife, including as recently as \nwithin a week of his March 2020 hearing, about her handling of their finances and of the \nimportance to them of his clearance so that he can continue to support their children. She \ncontinues to respond that she will take care of it and things will get better. (Tr. 64.) There is \nno evidence that Applicant has had any financial counseling. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he is a very hard-worker and considers himself trustworthy. \n(Tr. 62.) He requested that his track record of working for defense contractors since March \n2013 be taken into account. (Tr. 62.) He presented no character or work references \nattesting to the quality of his work. \n \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n7 \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \n\n8 \n \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant has not made any payments on his \nmortgage loan since July 2016, even though he continued to receive between $600 and \n$1,200 in rental income per month (depending on whether one or both apartments were \nrented). As of March 2019, his mortgage delinquency exceeded $30,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It \nhas likely increased, and his mortgage lender intends to foreclose on the property. The \nevidence also shows that he defaulted on the five credit-card accounts in the SOR (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f); on a federal student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and on four medical debts totaling $790 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.k). Under AG \u00b6 19, disqualifying conditions 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d \nand 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), the debts in the SOR have been delinquent for some time. \nThree of the medical debts are from 2015. Applicant\u2019s debts are considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. \n15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n\n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) warrants some consideration. The birth of Applicant\u2019s son in September \n2012 strained his household finances because of the extra expenses of caring for another \nchild. At the time, he was earning only $10 an hour as an assistant manager at a \nconvenience store, and his spouse had no income. Even so, the evidence indicates that \nthe debts identified in the SOR became seriously delinquent in 2015 or later, when \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor. His income was only $45,000 annually \nwhen he defaulted on his home loan, but he also had rental income that just about covered \nhis mortgage payment. Applicant credibly explained that was unaware initially that his ex-\nwife was not making the mortgage payment, and she also obtained credit in his name \nwithout his knowledge. He also paid $1,040 per month in child support until his ex-wife \nmoved in with him 12 to 18 months ago. Divorce could be considered a circumstance \nbeyond his control as contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b), but he also bears some \nresponsibility for his ongoing financial stress because he continues to allow his ex-wife \naccess to his money, knowing that she has spent unwisely. \n \n \nEven when factors outside of his control contributed to or caused his financial \nproblems, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a responsible manner when \ndealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, \n2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained contact with his creditors. Applicant \nattempted without success to modify the terms of his mortgage loan with his lender so that \nhe could stay in his home. While he acted responsibly to do so, it is unclear when he first \ntook action to possibly lower his monthly mortgage payment. It was irresponsible of \nApplicant to make no payments on his mortgage loan when he was taking in $1,200 per \nmonth from his tenants. Applicant and his ex-wife together settled some credit-card debts \nnot alleged in the SOR, but he has not contacted any of the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.k \nabout settling or making payments on the debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not satisfied. \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) are established. Applicant has made no effort to \naddress the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.k. He has characterized his finances as \u201cscrewed\u201d and \ntestified that he lives from paycheck to paycheck. However, he had about $1,000 in \nchecking-account deposits as of March 2020, and so should have been able to satisfy the \n$50 medical collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k), if not also make small payments on some of the \nother medical debts. While it appears likely that Applicant\u2019s mortgage loan will be \nforeclosed on, he may be liable for a deficiency balance that he cannot repay. There is no \nevidence that Applicant has had any financial counseling, which is required for mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(c), and could possibly assist him in making sound financial decisions. \nApplicant admits that he lost control of his family\u2019s household budget, and that he feels \noverwhelmed about his indebtedness. He continues to allow his ex-wife access to his \nchecking account, despite her history of irresponsible spending on vacations, including to \nItaly, as debts go unpaid. \n \n \nApplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has satisfied each \ndebt in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. June 5, 2006). \nHowever, he is required under Appeal Board precedent to demonstrate not only that he \n\n10 \n \nhas a plan to resolve his financial problems, but that he has taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006.) \nApplicant expressed his intent during his OPM interview to pay his debts at some point. \nThe Appeal Board has consistently held that a promise to pay a debt in the future is not a \nsubstitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. See e.g., ISCR Case No. \n09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010). Applicant has yet to demonstrate a track record of \ntimely repayment on his financial obligations to enable a predicative judgment that his \nfinancial problems are safely behind him. More progress is needed toward reestablishing \nfinancial stability to fully mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant has been employed in the defense industry since March 2013. He \nincreased his annual income by about $20,000, to $65,000, when he took his current job in \nAugust 2017. He has known since he applied for security clearance eligibility in October \n2017 that his finances could be an issue. His ex-wife appears to be the primary reason for \nhis ongoing financial stress because of her spending, which has hampered his ability to \nrepay his debts. Fearing that his ex-wife will act on threats to move his children elsewhere, \nApplicant has been reluctant to make the difficult decisions that would improve his financial \nsituation. \n \nA security clearance decision is a risk assessment about an individual\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and judgment with regard to whether he or she can be relied on \nto appropriately handle and safeguard classified information. It is not a debt-collection \nprocedure. I do not doubt that Applicant has been a good worker for his employer. \nHowever, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility \nfor Applicant at this time. \n\n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Young, Esq. \n \n \nSeptember 22, 2020 \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline E (personal \nconduct). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 9, 2017, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF-86). On April 16, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E. The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On July 1, 2019, Applicant submitted her \nAnswer to the SOR through her previous counsel. \n \nOn August 9, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to an administrative judge (AJ-1); and on September 5, 2019, DOHA \nreassigned the case to another administrative judge (AJ-2). On September 25, 2019, \nApplicant\u2019s current counsel notified DOHA that she had been retained and requested a \n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nchange of venue. On October 28, 2019, DOHA reassigned the case to another \nadministrative judge (AJ-3); on November 26, 2019, DOHA reassigned the case to \nanother administrative judge (AJ-4); and on January 6, 2020, the case was reassigned \nto me (AJ-5). On November 21, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the \nhearing for January 6, 2020 before AJ-3. An amended notice later rescheduled the case \nfor January 7, 2020, but that hearing did not take place.  \n \nOn January 27, 2020, DOHA issued a notice of hearing rescheduling the hearing \nfor March 3, 2020 before me (AJ-5). The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel submitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough M, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nI held the record open until March 20, 2020, to afford Applicant an opportunity to \nsubmit additional evidence. On March 11, 2020, DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.). On March 19, 2020, Applicant\u2019s counsel emailed me requesting a two-to-four \nweek extension of the post-hearing deadline to submit additional evidence. On March \n19, 2020, I emailed Applicant\u2019s counsel granting her request and extended the post-\nhearing due date to April 20, 2020. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I) On May 28, 2020, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted AE N and O, which were admitted without objection. No \nfurther exhibits were received before the record closed. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h to read \u201cIn or \naround December 2018\u201d versus \u201cIn or around June 2018.\u201d Without objection from \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion.

(SOR Answer) During her hearing, Applicant admitted \nSOR \u00b6 1.h (as amended). (Tr. 63) Her admissions are incorporated or adopted as \nfindings of fact.

She was awarded a \nbachelor of science degree in mathematics and computer science in December 2015. \nShe has completed one year of course work toward a master\u2019s degree. (GE 1; Tr. 18-\n20) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant married in December 2015, and has two sons, ages nine and five. Her \nhusband is employed full time as a network technician for a Fortune 500 company. (GE \n1; Tr. 20-21) Applicant served in the Army National Guard (ANG) from May 2008 to May \n2017, and was honorably discharged as a specialist (pay grade E-4). She was in a \nreserve drill status during her ANG service except for May 2009 to October 2009 when \nshe was in an active status. Her military occupational specialty was 92A, automated \nlogistical specialist. She successfully held a secret security clearance during her ANG \nservice. (GE 1; Tr. 22-23, 24-26, 87-90; AE K, AE O; HE I) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that Applicant falsified her timesheets to her then employer \n(Employer A) after she had resigned in December 2016, and collected wages for hours \nthat she did not work. As noted, she denied this allegation. Applicant testified that she \nsubmitted her resignation from Employer A on November 15, 2016, effective November \n30, 2016. She added that on November 30, 2016, she submitted her final timesheet by \nemail to Employer A and returned all work equipment. As such, she did not have access \nto her Employer A work email after that date, and claimed that she did not submit any \nadditional timesheets. (SOR Answer; Tr. 31-34; GE 2)  \n \nOn Monday, January 16, 2017, Employer A emailed Applicant advising her that \nshe had submitted timesheets for pay periods ending on December 15, 2016 and \nDecember 31, 2016, reporting hours that she had not worked. Based on those \ntimesheets, Employer A paid her $3,335.50. Employer A attached a demand letter \ndirecting Applicant to return the funds improperly received no later than January 20, \n2017, or they would pursue criminal, civil, and administrative action against her. On the \nFriday before Applicant received this demand letter, she had been in contact with an \nintermediate company official and advised him that she had not sent the timesheets in \nquestion and \u201cwanted to understand how this happened.\u201d (Tr. 35-37; GE 2, GE 5; AE M)  \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s counsel showed Applicant copies of the two timesheets in \nquestion, Applicant claimed that she had never seen the timesheets before her hearing. \nShe did acknowledge that her signature was on each of the timesheets and they looked \nidentical. Applicant did not recognize the manager approval signature, explaining that \nafter she submitted her timesheets she never saw the \u201cfinalized document.\u201d (Tr. 37, 80-\n84; GE 5) Regardless of whether Applicant personally submitted the timesheets, she \nacknowledged receiving wages by direct deposit based on the timesheets in question. \n(Tr. 38-39)  \n \nAfter Applicant received the demand letter from Employer A on January 16, \n2017, she emailed Employer A on that same day. She wrote, \u201cI didn\u2019t submit these time \ncards so I\u2019m not sure how this happened but I checked my account when [intermediate \ncompany official] brought this to my attention on Friday and the money is still sitting in \nmy account so I can send it back now. Please advise how to do so.\u201d Applicant returned \nthe unearned wages as instructed; and on January 26, 2017, Employer A \nacknowledged receipt of Applicant\u2019s check for $3,335.50. Employer A did not take any \nfurther action after receiving the funds. (Tr. 39-40 84-85; GE 2; AE M) \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that Applicant filed a false application for benefits under a \nstate supplemental nutrition assistance program in February 2017. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleged \nthat Applicant failed to timely disclose to her state department of social services that her \nnew employer was paying her a salary that would have disqualified her from receiving \nsuch benefits. As noted, she admitted both of these allegations. (SOR Answer) \n \nApplicant and her husband moved to their present geographical area in July \n2016, having both received contingent job offers. After moving, both offers \u201cfell through.\u201d \nShe stated, \u201cduring that time, my husband and I both separated . . . and I had to figure \nout how to pretty much take care of myself and my kids.\u201d Applicant claimed that her \nhusband moved out of the house in July or August 2016. She testified that she applied \nfor state nutritional benefits \u201caround August or September of 2016.\u201d After separating, \nApplicant stated that her husband did not provide any type of financial support. (Tr. 40-\n43, 80, 86-87)  \n \nApplicant began working for Employer A in August 2016, when she initially \napplied for benefits. (Tr. 75-76; GE 5) However, in December 2016 she started a new \njob with Employer B earning \u201c[r]oughly ($)80,000, so about $40 an hour,\u201d a salary that \nwould have disqualified her as a benefits recipient. Applicant admitted she did not report \nher new job with Employer B to her state, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t have a reason as to why not. I \njust didn\u2019t.\u201d As a benefits recipient, she was required to recertify every six months. In \nJanuary 2017, she received recertification paperwork to reapply for nutritional benefits. \nIn February 2017, she reapplied for benefits and intentionally failed to report her new \nposition and wages with Employer B. (Tr. 43-45) Applicant stated the reason for doing \nso was to \u201cclear up the debt that accrued during the time of my move and not having \nemployment.\u201d She estimates her debt at the time to be \u201ca little over $7,000.\u201d (Tr. 45-46, \n49-50) \n \nAs a nutritional benefits recipient, Applicant was receiving $550 a month \u201c[o]n the \ncard\u201d not including medical benefits. She did not pursue a child support enforcement \norder against her husband because she did not see her separation as \u201csomething being \npermanent.\u201d (Tr. 46-47, 80, 85-86; GE 7) Applicant believes that the state agency \ndiscovered she was ineligible to receive the benefits after they contacted Employer A. \nThe state agency notified her in mid-February 2017 that she no longer qualified for state \nnutritional benefits. (Tr. 47, 50, 75-76; GE 5, GE 7) \n \nDepartment Counsel questioned Applicant about when she changed her maiden \nname to her married name after she married in December 2015. Department Counsel \nshowed Applicant her initial benefits application dated September 14, 2016. On that \napplication, Applicant used her maiden name and claimed that she was \u201cSingle-Never \nMarried\u201d in the Marital Status section. Applicant claimed that she was not sure when \nshe changed her maiden name to her married name and \u201cmight have\u201d changed her \nname when she submitted her September 2016 benefits application. When asked why \nshe falsified her marital status, she replied, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure. I don\u2019t really have a \nresponse to that.\u201d (Tr. 73; GE 3) On that same benefits application, Applicant claimed \nthat she was working part time for the Army National Guard and part-time for an \nemployer (not Employer A or B) when in fact she was working full time for Employer A. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nWhen asked why she falsified her employment information, she replied, \u201c. . . I don\u2019t \nhave an answer.\u201d (Tr. 74; GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged that Applicant submitted a forged letter and pay stubs from \nEmployer A to her state to obtain improperly state nutritional benefits. As noted, she \nadmitted this allegation. Applicant explained that she submitted these forged documents \nto \u201cverify my income to be able to hold onto the [state nutritional] benefits.\u201d She stated \nthat she used the money to pay for household expenses and daycare for her children. \nApplicant understands that forging such documents is a crime. She acknowledges that \nshe made a bad decision, exercised bad judgment, and is remorseful.  Applicant stated, \n\u201cEverything\u2019s paid in full.\u201d (Tr. 52-55) \n \nDepartment Counsel showed Applicant her renewal application for state \nnutritional benefits dated February 19, 2017. Applicant acknowledged that she again \nused her maiden name in lieu of her married name and claimed on that application that \nshe was \u201cNever Married\u201d stating, \u201cI\u2019m not sure why I put never married.\u201d Applicant also \nclaimed on that application that she was working for Employer A, when in fact she was \nworking for Employer B, in order to retain her nutritional benefits. Applicant also claimed \non that application that she was making $12 an hour working for Employer A, when in \nfact she was making \u201c($)25 an hour\u201d working for Employer B. (Tr. 76-77; GE 4) After \nattempting to renew her benefits, Applicant submitted a forged letter to the state on \nEmployer A stationery, dated March 16, 2017, verifying her employment with Employer \nA. (Tr. 77-78; GE 5)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged that Applicant received a one-year ban from the nutritional \nbenefits program and was required in April 2017 to repay benefits. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleged \nthat Applicant received a two-year ban from the program based on her failure to \ndisclose that her husband and father of her children was living with her while she was \nreceiving benefits. As noted, she admitted both of these allegations. Applicant testified \nthat the state concluded that her husband was living with her because he listed her \naddress on his pay stubs. Once the state discovered that Applicant improperly received \nnutritional and medical benefits, they initiated the foregoing punitive action and required \nher to repay \u201c[a] little over three thousand\u201d dollars. The state did not file any criminal \ncharges against her. Applicant stated that she began reimbursing the state for ineligible \nbenefits received in \u201cabout March of 2017.\u201d She produced documentation from the two \nstate agencies responsible for administering nutritional and medical benefits reflecting \nthat she had reimbursed them for all improperly received benefits by the end of \nFebruary 2020. (Tr. 47-48, 50-60, 78-80, 86; GE 6, GE 7; AE J, AE L) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged that Applicant provided materially false information to the \ninvestigator during her December 11, 2018 U.S. Office of Personnel Management \npersonal subject interview (OPM PSI) when she denied that she submitted false \ntimesheets to her former employer. As noted, she denied this allegation. (See SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, discussed above.) Applicant testified that she told the investigator the truth about \nthe timesheets adding that she had no reason to lie. (Tr. 62-63; GE 2) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleged that Applicant provided materially false information to the \ninvestigator during her OPM PSI when she denied that she submitted a forged letter to \nher state agency that administered nutritional benefits. As noted, after Department \nCounsel amended the SOR to reflect the date of the interview, Applicant amended her \nSOR Answer during her testimony and admitted this allegation. Applicant stated that \nshe did not intend to provide false information during her interview. She added that the \n\u201cforged letter was completely not at the forefront of my mind until I went home and had \nthis discussion with my husband . . . .\u201d After going home after the interview, Applicant \ndiscussed her OPM PSI with her husband and he \u201cpretty much reminded me that this \nwas done.\u201d Applicant testified that she immediately attempted to contact the investigator \nand correct her statement. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted an exhibit detailing a \nseries of texts from December 12, 2018 to December 27, 2018, that she sent to the \ninvestigator in an attempt to contact him to correct her statement regarding the forged \nletter to her state agency. Unable to reach the investigator, she followed up with an \nemail dated January 14, 2019, to the investigator acknowledging that she submitted a \nforged letter to her state agency correcting her OPM PSI. (Tr. 63-65; GE 2; AE N; HE I) \n \nLooking back on her actions in filing for state benefits for which she was not \neligible, Applicant knew it was not the right choice, and is remorseful for what she did. \n(Tr. 49, 89-90) Applicant recognizes that her past conduct put her judgment and \ncharacter into question. She learned that her dishonest actions were not worth it and \ntestified that she will never engage in similar conduct. (Tr. 60-61) Applicant stated, \n\u201c[T]his conduct doesn\u2019t define me as a person.\u201d She explained that she found herself in \ndebt, panicked, and does not behave that way today. (Tr. 65-66)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted character letters from the following five people: (1) \ncoworker/six-year friend; (2) coworker/six-year friend; (3) eight-year friend; (4) non-profit \nbusiness partner for eight years; and (5) former supervisor at the Pentagon (December \n2016 to December 2017). In their letters, Applicant\u2019s character references spoke highly \nof her work ethic, dependability, integrity, and good character. Applicant stated that all \nof her character references are familiar with her SOR allegations. These individuals \nfavorably endorse Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. (Tr. 28-30; AE C(1 - \n5)) \n \nApplicant\u2019s marital situation that led to her questionable behavior has improved. \nShe and her husband have reconciled and are living together again as of April or May \n2017. She stated her husband has a stable job with an annual salary is \u201cabout \n($)70,000 a year.\u201d Applicant stated that she and her husband have regained financial \nstability and provided bank statements reflecting same. (Tr. 49, 56-57, 61, 80; AE E, AE \nD) Applicant considers herself to be loyal and patriotic. Applicant stated that she is \ntrustworthy and dependable in all aspects of her life, as an employee, parent, and \nfriend. (Tr. 68-69) \n \n \nApplicant submitted five certificates documenting professional milestones. (AE F) \nShe was in the process of starting a family entertainment business tailored to children \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nand adults of all ages. She submitted an exhibit detailing a comprehensive 2020 \nbusiness plan. At the time of the hearing, she was in the process of securing funding for \nher business.  (Tr. 66) Applicant is also involved in a community service nonprofit \norganization that offers a full range of programs to improve the lives of children from \npreschool to 12th grade. (Tr. 67-68; AE G) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct may be a security concern, stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \n AG \u00b6 16 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, component medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nunreliable behavior . . . ; (2) any . . . inappropriate behavior; and (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations.  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made multiple false statements, either orally or in \nwriting, to her employer, to state agencies, and during her clearance background \ninterview, largely about her eligibility to receive certain benefits under a state nutritional \nbenefits plan \u2013 benefits to which she was not entitled based on her income and \nemployment status. One allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) concerns a falsified timesheet, as a \nresult of which she received wages (later reimbursed) to which she was not entitled. \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f and 1.h are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand evidence presented. With regard to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant maintains that she did not \nsubmit the falsified timesheets as alleged. To accept Applicant\u2019s explanation, one would \nhave to accept that a person or persons unknown submitted her December 15, 2016 \nand December 31, 2016 timesheets, without her knowledge, on her behalf to Employer \nA, after she left their employment. A review of those timesheets bear Applicant\u2019s \nsignature, which she does not dispute, and the signatures on the disputed timesheets \nare similar to her other signatures on various exhibits.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s denials surrounding the timesheet submissions must be evaluated in \nthe context of her other contemporaneous conduct that raised credibility concerns \ndocumenting her intentional and deliberate falsifications. Her fraudulent deception \nbegan when she filed her initial September 14, 2016 nutritional benefits application by \nfalsely claiming both that she was single and never married and also that she was \nworking part-time for the ANG and part-time for an employer (not Employer A or B) \nwhen in fact she was working full time for Employer A. At the time she submitted this \nbenefits application to the state, she was apparently eligible for the nutritional benefits \nbased on her then income.  \n \n \nOn February 19, 2017, she reapplied for nutritional benefits, again falsely \nclaiming that she was single and never married. However, when she submitted this \napplication, she had been working for Employer B since December 2016 and was \nclearly ineligible to receive nutritional benefits based on her income. Committed to \nmaintaining her benefit eligibility, she forged a letter dated March 16, 2017, on Employer \nA stationary in an attempt to obtain nutritional benefits improperly. With regard to SOR \u00b6 \n1.g, when Applicant was interviewed during her December 2018 OPM PSI, she denied \nthat she submitted false timesheets to her employer.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), 16(c), and 16(d) are established, as well as the general concern \ndiscussed in AG \u00b6 15. As noted, Applicant admitted six of the eight allegations alleged \nunder this concern. After assessing the evidence and Applicant\u2019s credibility, I find her \nexplanations are not credible with regard to the allegations she denied. Accordingly, I \nfurther find that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g are established. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n AG \u00b6 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \nPartial application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) is appropriate for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.f; and full application of AG \u00b6 17(a) is appropriate for SOR \u00b6 1.h. No \napplications of any mitigating conditions under \u00b6 17 are appropriate for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.g. \n \nApplicant explained that she engaged in this conduct after the family\u2019s move to \ntheir present location in July 2016. Shortly after relocating, she and her husband were \ninformed that their contingent job offers \u201cfell through.\u201d In July or August 2016, Applicant \nand her husband separated, and she found herself as the sole support for her two \nyoung sons. In September 2016, Applicant, applied for nutritional benefits for which she \nwas eligible based on her single-mother status and on her then income with Employer \nA. However, that eligibility ceased when she began working for Employer B in \nDecember 2016 with a better paying job. She failed to notify her state of her \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \ndisqualifying income from Employer B. In February 2017, when she reapplied for \nnutritional benefits, she failed to report her new position with Employer B and her \nincreased wages. Moreover, in March 2017, Applicant submitted a forged letter from \nEmployer A to her state in an attempt to continue receiving those benefits improperly.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s state discovered her fraudulent behavior, and in April 2017, banned \nher from receiving nutritional benefits for a one-year period and required her to repay \nimproperly received benefits. In May 2017, her state banned her from receiving the \nbenefits for a two-year period for failure to disclose that her husband and father of her \nchildren was living with her while receiving benefits. In March 2017, Applicant began \nreimbursing the two state agencies for the benefits she improperly received. She \ncompleted the reimbursement in February 2020. She has also completed her benefit \neligibility bans. In January 2017, Applicant reimbursed Employer A for the wages she \nreceived that she had not earned.  \n \nApplicant has since reconciled with her husband. They have regained financial \nstability and the stressors that once existed in their marriage, that led to the majority of \nher poor choices in 2016 and 2017, have abated. Applicant also produced good \ncharacter evidence from five individuals who provided favorable evidence indicative of \nher work ethic, dependability, integrity, and good character. She provided certificates \nmarking professional milestones, evidence of community service, and a business plan \nto start a family entertainment business tailored to children and adults of all ages.  \n \nThe falsification alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is established. However, Applicant \nattempted to contact the investigator the day after the interview to correct her interview \nstatement in which she falsely denied submitting a forged letter from Employer A to her \nstate agency. She followed up with a series of texts, but was unable to reach the \ninvestigator. Her efforts culminated with a January 14, 2019 email to the investigator \nacknowledging that she submitted a forged letter to her state agency. In light of her \nprompt documented good-faith efforts to correct her misstatement. I conclude that SOR \n\u00b6 1.h is fully mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a).  \n \nHowever, I am unable to accept Applicant\u2019s testimony as credible, for reasons \ndiscussed above, with regard to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g. These allegations pertain to false \ntimesheets submitted to Employer A in December 2016 after she resigned from her \nposition and collected wages for unearned hours, and later during her December 11, \n2018 OPM PSI in which denied that she submitted those false timesheets to Employer \nA. Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness is further problematic because she reiterated her denials \nof the forged letter to Employer A during her hearing. Accordingly, I am unable to apply \nany mitigating conditions to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis section under \nGuideline E is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments \nare warranted. \nThis case falls short as one of rehabilitation or mitigation. Applicant is a 31-year-\nold senior share point developer employed as a defense contractor since January 2020. \nWhen confronted with a challenging personal situation in 2016, she applied for benefits \nin September 2016 for which she was apparently eligible. However, on that initial \napplication she misrepresented her marital and employment status. When her \nemployment situation improved in December 2016, rather than notify her state agency \nthat her income disqualified her from receiving further benefits, she continued to receive \nthose benefits. In February 2017, she reapplied for benefits for which she was not \neligible and provided materially false information regarding her eligibility. She \ncompounded her misconduct by submitting a forged letter from Employer A in March \n2017. Earlier, she attempted to collect wages from Employer A for hours that she did \nnot work by submitting false timesheets in December 2016. None of these acts of \ndeception ended well for Applicant. Her actions called her integrity into question and \nraised serious doubts about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nApplicant is a bright and talented individual with excellent credentials. She made \nthe mistake of letting her moral compass go adrift and has suffered adverse \nconsequences as a result. Her actions showing poor judgment were made when she \nwas relatively young and under financial pressure due to the separation from her \nspouse. These events should not define Applicant. Hopefully, these events have been a \nteachable moment for her and one from which she will recover. Given the cumulative \nnature and recency of her conduct, further time is required before a favorable national \nsecurity eligibility determination can be made. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nFormal Findings \n \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n      \nConclusion \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 21, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On November 25, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 9. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on December 16, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019, and did not respond. Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 \nthrough 9 are admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included a document that \nI admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 14, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 36, is divorced with one minor child. The record did not specify when \nhe received his high school diploma. He attended a university specializing in aviation and \naerospace on a part-time basis from March 2015 through May 2016, without earning a \ndegree. As of May 2019, he was pursuing a degree in electrical engineering technology. \nHe served on active duty as an aerographer in the U.S. Navy from February 2008 until \nFebruary 2017, when he received a general discharge due to misconduct. At the time of \nhis discharge, he was a first class petty officer (AG1). Since April 2017, he has been \nemployed as a civilian contractor working as an administrative assistant supporting a U.S. \nNavy human resources and administrative support contract. He has maintained a DOD \nsecurity clearance since 2008. (Item 3; Item 4 at 4, 5, 8-9, 19, 45; Item 5) \n \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged four incidents involving Applicant\u2019s excessive \nalcohol consumption between 2004 and 2016 including: two driving under the influence \n(DUI) convictions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d), and two other alcohol-related incidents, one at \nwork (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and one away from work (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also alleged that he was \ndiagnosed with a severe alcohol-use disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and that he continues to \nconsume alcohol after a treatment recommendation to abstain (SOR \u00b6 1.f). In his SOR \nanswer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f. (Items 1, 2) \n \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from 2001 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), including after having been granted a \nsecurity clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.b). It also alleged that he was diagnosed with a cannabis \nuse disorder (SOR \u00b6 2.c). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \u2013 2.c. However, he reported a period of abstinence from marijuana from 2008 until \n2016. (Items 1, 2) \n \nGuideline G \n \nIn 2004, Applicant consumed three to four rum-and-coke mixed drinks during an \nunspecified period of time while at a club with friends. While he was driving home, a police \nofficer stopped him for an unknown reason. After failing a field sobriety test, Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with DUI, and spent 24 hours in jail. He was later convicted of \nDUI and sentenced to 40 hours in jail, including the 24 hours he already served and 16 \nhours he served during weekends. He also paid a $300 fine. (Item 2 at 1; Item 4 at 16-\n17) \n \nIn 2009, while on active duty with the U.S. Navy, Applicant consumed 10 to 12 \nbeers one day between 2:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. while at a barbeque with friends. The \nfollowing morning, he overslept and missed a mandatory briefing at work. A co-worker \ncame to his residence to wake him up and bring him to work. Once Applicant arrived at \n\n \n3 \n \nwork, his supervisor smelled alcohol emanating from him. He was verbally reprimanded \nand sent to a 10-day outpatient alcohol treatment program, which he successfully \ncompleted. (Item 3 at 42; Item 4 at 10) \n \nIn 2011, while on active duty with the U.S. Navy but on extended leave for training, \nApplicant consumed an excessive amount of alcohol during an unspecified period of time \nwhile at a house party with friends. At one point, he was asked to leave the party because \nhe got into a verbal altercation due to being too drunk and acting out, too loud, and \ninappropriate towards female guests at the party. He left that house and walked to a \nfriend\u2019s house nearby. Because his friend did not respond to his repeated knocking, he \nlost his temper and kicked the sliding glass door causing it to break. Shortly thereafter, \nhe was arrested and charged with public swearing and intoxication (Charge 1) and \ndestruction of property (Charge 2), and spent one night in jail. After his arrest, he learned \nthat he had been at the wrong house, which belonged to a stranger and not his friend. \nCharge 2 was nolle prossed. Charge 1 was dismissed after he paid $800 in restitution. \nHis command ordered him to undergo a 30-day inpatient alcohol treatment program, \nwhich he successfully completed. (Item 3 at 36-37, 42-43; Item 4 at 14, 23; Items 6, 8) \n \nIn February 2016, while on active duty with the U.S. Navy, Applicant consumed six \nvodka shots and six beers while at dinner with a friend over an unspecified period of time. \nAfter dinner, he drove the friend to a club, which was closed when they arrived. He then \ndrove them to a nearby park to wait for the club to open. They fell asleep while waiting. \nApplicant, who was behind the wheel, was awoken by a police officer just before midnight. \nAfter failing a field sobriety test and having a blood alcohol content over the legal limit, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI, and spent the night in jail. In October 2016, \nafter pleading not guilty, he was convicted of DUI and sentenced to 90 days in jail (85 \ndays suspended), which he served on the weekends. His driver\u2019s license was restricted \nfor one year, and he was ordered to install an interlock ignition device on his vehicle for \nsix months. He also paid a $250 fine. (Item 3 at 37-39, 42; Item 4 at 15-16; Item 7) \n \nApplicant did not notify his command of his 2016 DUI for fear that he would get \ninto trouble. He was hoping that he could handle the matter on his own. However, his \ncommand discovered the 2016 DUI during an internal background investigation that was \nbeing conducted for Applicant\u2019s potential promotion. In October 2016, Applicant was \ncharged with violating Article 92 (failure to obey any order or regulation) for which he was \nimposed the following non-judicial punishment: removal of recommendation for promotion \nto E-7, reduction in rank to E-5 (suspended), and forfeiture of one-half month\u2019s pay times \ntwo (suspended). (Item 3 at 24; Item 4 at 9, 11-13) \n \nIn November 2016, after a command-ordered alcohol evaluation stemming from \nhis 2016 DUI, Applicant was admitted to a 35-day substance abuse rehabilitation program \n(SARP) for the treatment of alcohol dependence. He was diagnosed with severe alcohol \nuse disorder. After Applicant was notified that he tested positive for marijuana during \nintake, he disclosed a pattern of regular marijuana use for several months prior to his \nadmission to SARP. He was then also diagnosed with mild cannabis use disorder. Upon \nhis successful completion of SARP, he was discharged in December 2016. At discharge, \nthe initial two diagnoses remained unchanged, and the recommendations of his SARP \n\n \n4 \n \ntreatment team included \u201cPatient remains advised to abstain from all alcohol and any \nother substance use.\u201d These recommendations were in addition to the terms of the \naftercare plan discussed below. Throughout his SARP treatment, Applicant was a very \nactive participant. As further validation of the improvement and work he achieved while \nat SARP, he was selected by his peers and treatment team to be the student-speaker at \nthe commencement ceremony. (Item 2 at 2, 3; Item 3 at 43-44; Item 4 at 4, 11-12, 15, 22; \nItem 9 at 3, 5, 6, 7, 9) \n \nFollowing his discharge from SARP in December 2016, Applicant was removed \nfrom regular duty and required to engage in a continuing care program with a command-\napproved aftercare plan (formulated with input from Applicant and his SARP treatment \nteam) over the following 12 months. His aftercare plan included abstention from the \nconsumption of alcohol and drugs, participation in one to three Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) meetings per week, participation in bi-weekly outpatient group sessions, \nparticipation in the Navy MORE program (a web-based tool to assist with personal growth \nand abstinence during the first year of recovery), and random and periodic urinalysis \ntesting. (Item 4 at 4; Item 9 at 8-9, 12-24) \n \nAccording to treatment records, Applicant reportedly abstained from alcohol while \nparticipating in the continuing care program. However, he failed to follow other aftercare \nplan requirements on more than one occasion. Despite repeated reminders of his \nrequirement to do so, he failed to complete the requisite tasks of the Navy MORE \nprogram. He failed to attend any AA meetings or contact his sponsor one week. He used \nmarijuana over the New Year\u2019s holiday weekend in January 2017 and over the Valentine\u2019s \nDay weekend in February 2017. The details of his marijuana use during those weekends \nwere not specified in the record. His participation in the continuing care program ended \nwhen he was discharged from the U.S. Navy in February 2017. (Item 4 at 4; Item 9 at 8-\n9, 12-24) \n \nDuring his April 2018 security clearance interview (SI), Applicant reported the \nfollowing history of his alcohol consumption: from 1999 to 2004, he drank three beers per \nmonth; from 2004 to 2008, he drank one to six beers three to four times per week; from \n2008 to 2009, during his first year in the military when he cut back his consumption to \nstay in good physical condition, he drank three beers once per week; from 2009 to 2017, \nhe drank one to six beers three to four times per week; from 2017 through present, he \ndrank three beers per week. Although he averred that it took eight to ten beers for him to \nbecome intoxicated, he admitted that he drank to intoxication every two weeks prior to his \n2016 DUI. He maintained that he had not consumed alcohol to intoxication since his 2016 \nDUI. He acknowledged that he had a problem with alcohol and that he took action to \ncontrol it by attending counseling after his 2016 DUI. Inexplicably, Applicant did not \nreference any period of abstention from the consumption of alcohol, including while he \nwas participating in SARP treatment and the continuing care program. (Item 4 at 18-19) \n \nIn May 2019, Applicant asserted that he was committed to abstaining from the \nconsumption of alcohol. He cited his child as his primary motivation for doing so. In his \nOctober 2019 SOR answer, Applicant acknowledged that he continued to consume \nalcohol. He stated that when he \u201celects to partake in an alcohol beverage,\u201d he ensures \n\n \n5 \n \nthat he partakes \u201cresponsibly.\u201d He averred that he does not exceed three beverages and \n\u201ctakes no chances in getting behind the wheel.\u201d (Item 2 at 2; Item 4 at 5) \n \nGuideline H \n \nApplicant used marijuana during two periods of his life. The first period began in \neither 2001 or 2002 and continued until 2007 when he began to transition into the military. \nThe second period began sometime after he separated from his wife in January 2015 and \ncontinued through February 2017, during which time he was on active duty in the U.S. \nNavy and in possession of a security clearance. The facts and circumstances underlying \nhis use during those two periods are not entirely clear due to a combination of the lack of \nspecific information in the record, and Applicant\u2019s differing accounts. (Item 2 at 2-3; Item \n3 at 40-41; Item 4 at 17-18, 23) \n \nOn his June 2017 SCA, Applicant reported October 2016 as his most recent use \nof marijuana. He did not specify his frequency of use during the first period beyond stating \nthat it gradually became more frequent with his \u201cheaviest use\u201d to be \u201cabout 1/8 of an \nounce per week.\u201d He did not address the frequency of his use during the second period. \nHe asserted that the second period began in the fall of 2016, when he had \u201cbecome \ndiscouraged with senior leadership and could no longer support agendas outlined in new \npolices.\u201d He claimed that he used marijuana during the second period because he knew \nthat finding traces of marijuana \u201cwould open a door for [him] to transition back to the \ncivilian sector.\u201d He answered \u201cNo\u201d to whether he had ever purchased marijuana. He \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to whether he intended to use marijuana in the future. (Item 3 at 40-41) \n \nApplicant discussed his marijuana use during his April 2018 and May 2018 SIs. He \nreiterated that he had not used marijuana after October 2016. He acknowledged that, \nupon enlistment in the U.S. Navy, he reported using marijuana 45 times during the first \nperiod. He estimated that he used marijuana approximately six to eight times during the \nsecond period. He explained that he used marijuana out of curiosity and because he \nenjoyed it. He attributed his use during the second period to providing him with an escape \nfrom the stresses of reality as he dealt with getting caught at work for his DUI and his \nmarital separation. He reaffirmed that he had no intent to use marijuana in the future \nbecause of its negative impact on him. (Item 4 at 17-18, 23) \n \nApplicant acknowledged during his April 2018 SI that he obtained the marijuana \nhe used during both periods either through friends or by purchasing it himself. He \nestimated that he purchased it approximately 20 times between 2003 and October 2016. \nHe admitted that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question on his SCA about purchasing \nmarijuana because he did not want to \u201clook bad.\u201d He asserted that he had no intent to \npurchase marijuana in the future. He acknowledged that he continued to associate \napproximately one to two times per year with one of the friends with whom he had used \nmarijuana. (Item 4 at 17-18) \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana, but only through \nDecember 2016. He recognized that he made a terrible decision to use marijuana, which \nhe described as \u201chaphazardly lean[ing] on an old crutch.\u201d He admitted that he \u201clost \n\n \n6 \n \ncontrol,\u201d which led him toward \u201can escapist mentality\u201d towards the despair he felt at that \ntime of his life due to his 2016 DUI, unfolding divorce, and other sensitive matters \ninvolving his wife. He asserted that after he tested positive for marijuana during his SARP \ntreatment, he \u201cimmediately shifted [his] mindset.\u201d (Item 2 at 2-3; Item 4 at 5) \n \nWhole Person \n \nApplicant reported facts about the 2009, 2011, and 2016 alcohol-related incidents \non his 2017 SCA. He was interviewed by a DOD authorized investigator three times \nbetween April and May 2008 in connection with his security clearance. When asked why \nhe failed to report the 2004 DUI on his SCA, he asserted that he misunderstood the \nquestion and believed that he only had to report incidents within the prior seven years. \nHe failed to report, acknowledge, or otherwise address the two times he used marijuana \nin 2017 (which was revealed in his treatment records) at any point during the security \nclearance process. These omissions were not alleged in the SOR so they will be \nconsidered only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept. (Item 3 at 36-39, \n42-43; Item 4 at 16) \n \nIn February 2017, Applicant received a general discharge from the U.S. Navy for \nserious misconduct because of his 2006 DUI conviction and having tested positive for \nmarijuana. It was unclear in the record whether the discharge related to the positive test \nfor marijuana during his initial SARP intake or another test in February 2017. Applicant \nasserted that it related to the intake test, but his treatment records show that he was \nrequired to submit to a urinalysis in February 2017, the results of which were not specified. \nHis military record revealed that an enlistment waiver had been approved for his 2004 \nDUI and prior marijuana use. (Item 3 at 23-24; Item 4 at 4, 11-13; Item 9 at 23)  \n \nApplicant made statements in his SCA, during his SIs, and in his SOR answer \naccepting responsibility for his excessive alcohol consumption and drug involvement. He \nalso offered excuses and explanations that were minimizing his behavior and culpability. \nHe maintained that he is no longer the same person who was involved in the incidents \nalleged in the SOR and hopes that his story will help others avoid the mistakes he made. \n(Item 2; Item 3 at 36-39, 42-43; Item 4 at 5, 10, 14-17, 23) \n \nApplicant was promoted by his employer in January 2018. A senior manager \npraised his \u201cexemplary\u201d work performance for which he has received accolades from his \nsuperiors and peers. In her role, she has the opportunity to observe Applicant on a \nconsistent and regular basis. She has not witnessed Applicant consuming alcohol during \ncompany events where alcohol is available. She has not seen or heard of any instances \nwhere Applicant had been late to work, or appeared to be under the influence of any \nsubstance while at work. She proffered that Applicant has demonstrated a high level of \nhumility, integrity, and strong work ethic. Without specifying the details of what he told \nher, she stated that Applicant took \u201cfull ownership\u201d for \u201chis actions while in the military\u201d \nand the \u201cpoor decisions he made during that period in his life.\u201d (Item 4 at 8; AE A) \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or \njeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(e):\n \nAG \u00b6 22(f):\n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \n so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n \n \nThe security significance of Applicant\u2019s 2004 DUI is brought current by his more \nrecent 2016 DUI. Collectively, his DUIs and other alcohol-related incidents raise \nquestions about his good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s \nacknowledgment and acceptance of responsibility for his problems with alcohol were \nundercut by his minimizing explanations and excuses. Applicant reportedly abstained \nfrom alcohol while participating in SARP and the continuing care program. Upon his \ndischarge from SARP, when he was diagnosed with severe alcohol use disorder, \nApplicant was advised to abstain from all alcohol consumption. While he asserted that he \nwas committed to abstention in May 2019, he reported that he was drinking three beers \nper week from 2017 through at least April 2018. In October 2019, he reported that he \ncontinued to \u201cresponsibly\u201d consume alcohol and did not drive after drinking. I have doubts \nthat Applicant has truly acknowledged and accepted his limitations with alcohol. \nMoreover, given his history, Applicant has not demonstrated a sufficient pattern of \nmodified behavior for me to conclude that his excessive consumption of alcohol and the \nquestionable judgment with which it is associated are behind him.  \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nThe facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n\n \n10 \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 (d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of substance use disorder;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 (e): failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program \nprescribed by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25 (f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nAny illegal drug use is troubling in the context of evaluating security worthiness. \nHad he not resumed marijuana use after 2007, Applicant could have demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation and mitigated any drug-involvement concerns. However, he not \nonly resumed using marijuana while on active duty in the U.S. Navy, but also while he \nwas in possession of a security clearance. Applicant was not candid about his marijuana \nuse either with his command or during the security clearance process. The U.S. Navy \ndiscovered his marijuana use only after he tested positive during his intake for alcohol \ntreatment. He was diagnosed with mild cannabis use disorder. Although abstaining from \nmarijuana use was a requirement of his 12-month aftercare plan following his December \n\n \n11 \n \n2016 discharge from SARP, he used marijuana in January and February 2017. Given his \nlack of candor, I question not only the frequency of the marijuana use that Applicant self-\nreported, but also the sincerity of his commitment to abstinence. The facts and \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use continue to raise substantial doubts \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and H in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and H, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his of history excessive alcohol consumption and drug involvement. I \nam also troubled by Applicant\u2019s lack of candor with his command and throughout the \nsecurity clearance process. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n\n \n12 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "full_text": "1 \n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \n \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n--- \n) \nISCR Case No. 19-00555 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Daniel F. Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/17/2020\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding personal conduct. Eligibility for \na security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 7, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He \nresponded to those interrogatories on June 6, 2019. On July 23, 2019, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines  (AG) (December \n10, 2016) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and \ndetailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement dated August 13, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on October 30, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 \ndays, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nAdjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on \nNovember 12, 2019. His response was due on December 12, 2019. Applicant chose not \nto respond to the FORM, for as of January 13, 2020, no response had been received. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 13, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with some comments that gave the \nimpression that he was actually disputing some of the aspects of the allegations, nearly \nall of the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e., and \n1.g.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and \nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a project manager with his current employer since June 2014. He previously served \nas a teacher in a county school system from August 2004 until July 2014. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2003, and a master\u2019s degree on line in 2015. He has never served \nwith the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married in \n2005. He has two children, born in 2009 and 2011. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nAs noted above, Applicant was a teacher of elective subjects (i.e., music, foreign \nlanguages, art, drama, inventions and innovations), as opposed to core subjects \n(language arts, social studies, science, and mathematics) in the county school system for \nten years. During at least a portion of his tenure, Applicant and his middle school principal \nand assistant principal had disagreements regarding Applicant\u2019s teaching methods and \nprofessional conduct, as well as Applicant\u2019s criticisms of their support of an adversarial \nrelationship between core teachers and elective teachers. (Item 4 \u2013 Triggered Enhanced \nSubject Interview, dated October 31, 2018, at 6) As a result of their respective \ndisagreements, each side apparently made accusations against the other, as follows:  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.: In 2009, the middle-school management (principal or assistant \nprincipal) reportedly accused Applicant of misconduct in dealing with his students, not \notherwise specified in the SOR, but specified in a report of the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), as yelling at students; throwing objects at students; failure to follow \nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) accommodation of modifications; ignoring \nstudents request for help with classwork; making inappropriate putdowns and sarcastic \nremarks; and hitting students in the back of the head for mistakes or stupid questions. As \na result of the accusations, Applicant reportedly appeared before the school board to \ndefend himself, and he was suspended for three days without pay. (Item 4, at 7) Applicant \ndenied the underlying basis for the accusations, claiming that they were all false, and he \nindicated that his different and engaging approach with his students was misinterpreted \nby management. (Item 4, at 7) He conceded that he was suspended, but contended that \nthe event took place in 2011, and that the suspension was for five days. (Item 2 \u2013 Answer \nto the SOR, dated August 13, 2019, at 1) It should be noted that there is no documentation \nin evidence, such as school disciplinary records, school personnel performance \nevaluations, school reports of investigation describing the alleged incidents, statements \nof witnesses, or school board records, upon which the accusations were based or to \nsupport the allegations. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.: In November 2010, while serving as a schoolteacher, Applicant was \nreportedly placed on a Plan of Improvement (POI). (Item 4, at 8) Applicant conceded that \nhe received a POI, but contended that it was related to the issues that took place in 2011. \n(Item 2, at 1) It should be noted that there is no documentation in evidence, such as the \nPOI, upon which the accusation was based or to support the allegation.  \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.: In March 2011, while serving as a schoolteacher, Applicant was \nreportedly accused of misconduct in dealing with his students, not otherwise specified in \nthe SOR, but specified in the OPM report, as kicking a table where a student had been \nlaying his head while asleep in class; and kicking the chair of a student who was rocking \nback. As a result of the accusations, Applicant reportedly appeared before the school \nboard to defend himself, and he was suspended for five days without pay and required to \nattend an anger management class. (Item 4, at 8) Applicant denied the underlying basis \nfor the accusations, claiming that he never kicked a chair, but he conceded that he might \nhit or bump a table a few times to wake up a sleeping student while in the shop class.  \n(Item 4, at 8) He acknowledged that he completed an online, self-paced 40-hour anger \nmanagement class. (Item 4, at 8; Item 2, at 1) It should be noted that there is no \ndocumentation in evidence, such as school disciplinary records, school personnel \nperformance evaluations, school reports of investigation describing the alleged incidents, \nstatements of witnesses, or school board records, upon which the accusations were \nbased or to support the allegations. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.: In June 2012, while serving as a schoolteacher, Applicant was \nreportedly accused of misconduct in dealing with his students, not otherwise specified in \nthe SOR, but specified in the OPM report, as using his forearm to push a student; and for \nmaking an inappropriate comment to a student with respect to pushing the student. It \nallegedly resulted that the inappropriate comments were founded, but there was no \nreported result of the other accusation. (Item 4, at 8) The SOR also alleged, as part of the \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \naccusation, that at some point in 2012 or 2013, Applicant received a letter of reprimand \nfor insubordination. Applicant conceded the allegation(s), but contended that the event(s) \ntook place in 2011, as described above. (Item 2, at 1) It should be noted that there is no \ndocumentation in evidence, such as school disciplinary records, school personnel \nperformance evaluations, school reports of investigation describing the alleged incidents, \nor statements of witnesses, upon which the accusations were based or to support the \nallegations. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e.: It appears that this allegation is actually a combination of several \nunrelated allegations. In February 2014, while serving as a schoolteacher, Applicant was \nreportedly accused of misconduct in dealing with his students, not otherwise specified in \nthe SOR, but specified in the OPM report, as stating to a student that \u201cif I weren\u2019t a teacher \nI\u2019d punch you in the face.\u201d (Item 4, at 8) It was also alleged that in 2014, Applicant \ndisagreed with his supervisors on duties to which he was assigned; that he was \nsuspended with pay; and that \u201ce]ther the school principal or the superintendent of schools \nrecommended the school board dismiss [Applicant] from [his] teaching position,\u201d and that \nhe then left his position as a schoolteacher to take a private sector job in a different line \nof work. Applicant denied the accusation of misconduct with a student, claiming that after \nthe student in an 8th grade athletic class flung another student\u2019s folder off the desk and \nacross the room, Applicant commented that the student should be careful because once \nhe gets across the street (to the high school) he would get punched in the face for such \nconduct. (Item 4, at 8)  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he had disagreements with the principal and \nassistant principal because they imposed unreasonable extra obligations on elective \nteachers versus core teachers; they removed students from his class for nearly any \nreason related to their core classes; they did not give elective teachers sufficient time to \neat lunch or plan periods; elective teachers were treated as second-class citizens; and \nmiddle-school management made false accusations against him. (Item 4, at 6) Applicant \nadmitted disagreements with management, and indicated that he had initially spoken with \nthe human resources department (HR) about transferring to a different school because \nof his personality clash with the principal. He claimed that HR told him he could stay on \nadministrative leave until the end of the school year, and that he told HR that he intended \nto resign. Applicant denied that the school superintendent recommended that the school \nboard dismiss him from his teaching position. (Item 4, at 6-7; Item 2, at 1) It should be \nnoted that there is no documentation in evidence, such as school disciplinary records, \nschool personnel performance evaluations, school reports of investigation describing the \nalleged incidents, statements of witnesses, school board records, or records from the \nsuperintendent of schools, upon which the accusations were based or to support the \nallegations. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f.: On February 7, 2018, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he \nresponded to certain questions pertaining to his employment activities found in Section \n13A \u2013 Employment Activities. The most significant questions, and the ones alleged in the \nSOR, were essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years, have you: been fired; quit \nafter being told you would be fired; left by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct; or left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nperformance; and in the last seven (7) years, have you received a written warning, been \nofficially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such \nas a violation of security policy. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. (Item 3, at 13) \nHe allegedly omitted and concealed his reported reprimand and suspensions for the \nalleged misconduct in the workplace. He certified that his responses to those questions \nwere \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because \nof his omission and concealment, the response to the second question regarding \ndiscipline was, allegedly, false. Applicant denied that he falsified his answer, and \nsteadfastly contended that he resigned to take a new career, and that he was never \nterminated. (Item 2, at 1)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g.: On February 7, 2018, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he also \nresponded to certain questions pertaining to his employment record found in Section 13C \n\u2013 Employment Record. The most significant questions, associated with employment \nactivities that have not been previously listed in the SF 86, and the ones alleged in the \nSOR, were essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years, have you: been fired from \na job; quit a job after being told you would be fired; left a job by mutual agreement following \ncharges or allegations of misconduct; left a job by mutual agreement following notice of \nunsatisfactory performance; and received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, \nsuspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security \npolicy. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions. (Item 3, at 14) Applicant denied falsifying \nthe answer, and contended that he had misread the question, and he thought it was the \nsame question as the one referred to in SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Item 2, at 1) A close reading of the \nquestion clearly specifies that it refers to employment activities that have not been \npreviously listed in the SF 86. Thus, I conclude that it is merely a redundant question that \nessentially repeats the one in Section 13A. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by [any] \nindividual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nif known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding. . . . \n \nApplicant admittedly had conflicts and disagreements with his principal and \nassistant principal regarding his duties and responsibilities as a schoolteacher of middle \nschool elective courses; and some of his teaching methods. Nevertheless, despite those \nconflicts and disagreements, he was retained in his position for a decade, indicating that \nthe alleged misconduct was either misleading, not as bad as presented in the OPM report, \nor baseless. The alleged facts found in both the OPM report, and as distilled in the SOR, \nreflect a number of alleged incidents, some with dates, and some without, without any \ndocumentation to support those allegations. Instead, facts are floated by the OPM \ninvestigator and responded to by Applicant, establishing Applicant as the purported \nsource for the allegations against him. The facts essentially come down to a dispute of \nalleged misconduct reportedly made by school management versus the explanations by \nApplicant. It is also troubling that one allegation was that either the school principal or the \nsuperintendent of schools recommended the school board dismiss Applicant from his \nteaching position. There is zero evidence that such a recommendation was made by the \nprincipal or the superintendent, or that any such recommendation was actually made to, \nor received by, the school board. Applicant was not dismissed by the county school \nsystem. In an effort to truly furnish Applicant with the due process he deserves, the matter \ncould have been properly resolved with a more complete OPM investigation and the \npresentation by the government of essential documentation, such as school disciplinary \nrecords, school personnel performance evaluations, school reports of investigation \ndescribing the alleged incidents, statements of witnesses, school board records, or \nrecords of the superintendent of schools, upon which the accusations were based or to \nsupport the allegations. \n \nFurthermore, Department Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s performance as a \nteacher was deemed unsatisfactory to the extent that he was placed on a POI. Without a \ncopy of the POI, that argument is a stretch. If a POI was actually instituted, it could have \nbeen for a variety of reasons, including unsatisfactory performance; failure to comply with \ncertain procedures or policies; unacceptable language; unacceptable touching of a \nstudent; disrespect to a superior; throwing objects at students; maybe tardiness; or other \nperceived failures as a schoolteacher. \n   \nIn addition, normally an applicant\u2019s comments provide sufficient evidence to \nexamine if his or her submissions were deliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or \nmerely inaccurate answers that were the result of oversight or misunderstanding of the \ntrue facts on his or her part. Proof of incorrect answers, standing alone, does not establish \nor prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the falsification or omission occurred. \nAs an administrative judge, I must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state \nof mind at the time the alleged falsifications or omissions occurred.  \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s explanations associated \nwith his admissions and/or denials of the SOR allegations. Department Counsel has \nargued that Applicant\u2019s work history as a teacher and his knowledge of the English \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nlanguage as a person who has earned a master\u2019s degree provide convincing evidence \nthat Applicant deliberately falsified his answers to the questions in sections 13A and 13C \nof his SF 86. It is unclear how he reached that conclusion, for there is no evidence that \nteaching middle school students shop or athletics with an on-line master\u2019s degree can \nestablish that someone deliberately lied as opposed to making a mistake. As noted \nabove, Applicant did controvert the falsification allegations. He disputed the allegation \nthat he was about to be fired when he left his teaching position. He disputed the underlying \nallegations regarding his history as a schoolteacher, and he omitted and concealed his \nreported reprimand and suspensions for the alleged misconduct in the workplace.  \n \nWith respect to the first question under section 13A of the SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) and \nthe entire allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.g., AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. With respect to \nthe second question under section 13A of the SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.f.), it should be recognized \nthat the question only asks about disciplinary action within the last seven years before the \nSF 86 was completed (in 2018), yet the SOR allegation is that Applicant falsified his \nresponse by denying reported discipline that occurred outside that period as well. \nNevertheless, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e., AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) have been \nestablished, but with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., no disqualifying condition has \nbeen established.   \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant was a schoolteacher at a middle school in the county school system for \na decade from August 2004 until July 2014. He admittedly had conflicts and \ndisagreements with his principal and assistant principal regarding his duties and \nresponsibilities as a teacher of elective courses; and some of his teaching methods. \nAmong some of the accusations made against him were: yelling at students; throwing \nobjects at students; failure to follow IEP accommodation of modifications; ignoring \nstudents request for help with classwork; making inappropriate putdowns and sarcastic \nremarks; kicking a table where a student had been laying his head while asleep; kicking \nthe chair of a student who was rocking back; and hitting students in the back of the head \nfor mistakes or stupid questions. As a result of those accusations, conflicts, and \ndisagreements, he was reportedly disciplined with suspensions and a POI. Nevertheless, \ndespite the accusations, Applicant was retained by the school district as a schoolteacher \nfor a decade. It was also reported that Applicant had been recommended by either the \nprincipal or the superintendent that he be terminated by the school board. However, there \nis no documentation in evidence, such as school disciplinary records, school personnel \nperformance evaluations, school reports of investigation describing the alleged incidents, \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nstatements of witnesses, school board records, or records from the superintendent of \nschools, upon which the accusations were based or to support the allegations. The most \nrecent allegation associated with his conduct as a schoolteacher is supposed to have \noccurred in 2014, nearly six years ago. Accordingly, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.e., AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(f) apply. \n \nWith respect to the allegation that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts \nassociated with disciplinary actions he may have received while he was employed as a \nschoolteacher by the county school system (the second question under section 13A of \nthe SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.f.)), Applicant acknowledged that there were some disciplinary \nactions taken during his tenure, but he disputed the dates and much of the alleged \ndiscipline. He kept focusing on issues that he thought occurred in 2011. Moreover, he \nclaimed that in responding to the question, he concentrated on the issue of termination. \nUpon reflection, he conceded that the issues could have been handled differently, but he \ntook full ownership of them. In so doing, it remains unclear if he was referring to his \nhandling of the disputes with middle-school management, or in how he answered the \nquestion. Nevertheless, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(f) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. As a \nschoolteacher, he admittedly had conflicts and disagreements with his principal and \nassistant principal regarding his duties and responsibilities as a schoolteacher of middle \nschool elective courses; and some of his teaching methods. He was reportedly repeatedly \naccused of misconduct in dealing with his students, and he was reportedly disciplined. \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nWhen completing his SF 86 in 2018, he failed to accurately respond to a question \nregarding disciplinary action taken against him in the last seven years.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nproject manager with his current employer since June 2014. He previously served as a \nschoolteacher in a county school system from August 2004 until July 2014. While there \nwere issues between the middle-school management and Applicant, they were \napparently not sufficiently important to disrupt his decade-long tenure with the school \nsystem. Moreover, Applicant left that position nearly six years ago. There is no negative \nevidence regarding Applicant\u2019s current job performance. Although the SOR made several \nallegations based on accusations of misconduct by Applicant during his tenure with the \ncounty school system, there is no documentation in evidence, such as school disciplinary \nrecords, school personnel performance evaluations, school reports of investigation \ndescribing the alleged incidents, statements of witnesses, school board records, or \nrecords from the superintendent of schools, upon which the accusations were based or \nto support the allegations. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003, and a master\u2019s \ndegree on line in 2015.  \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E, H, and J. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 6, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 26, 2019.  \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on January 29, 2020. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, called two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted without objection.  \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since about 2017. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which \nhe has held since about 2014. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. He has never \nmarried, and he has no children. He lives with his girlfriend. (Transcript (Tr.) at 40, 48-\n49, 53, 97; GE 1, 4, 6; AE 1, 4) \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant used illegal drugs before or after June 2017. \nIn June 2017, he accepted an offer from a friend to smoke marijuana and use MDMA \n(3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine), a controlled substance commonly known as \necstasy.1 Applicant decided that he liked marijuana, and he purchased about three \nounces of marijuana from his friend. His friend also gave him another MDMA pill. \nApplicant stated in his October 2018 affidavit that he paid \u201capproximately $300\u201d for the \nmarijuana. He testified he paid \u201cabout $500.\u201d He stated that the marijuana was for his \npersonal use. He used marijuana on a few more occasions in June 2017. Because of \npolice intervention, Applicant never had the opportunity to take the MDMA pill or the \nremainder of his marijuana. (Tr. at 52-55, 64, 82-84; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1; AE 1, 4) \n \nIn June 2017, Applicant and his friends were driving to a music festival. They \nwere stopped by the police a few blocks from his apartment. Applicant believes a \nconfidential informant provided the information to the police, because the police knew \nwho they were, where they were going, and that they had drugs in their possession that \nthey intended to use at the festival. The police searched the car and seized about five \ngrams of marijuana that belonged to Applicant and additional marijuana that belonged \nto the other passengers. The police searched Applicant\u2019s apartment and seized the \nMDMA pill that Applicant received from his friend and about three ounces of marijuana, \nhalf of which belonged to Applicant\u2019s roommate. (Tr. at 55-60, 84-84; GE 1, 4; AE 1, 4) \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to \ndistribute and possession of a controlled substance. In June 2018, he pleaded guilty to \npossession of a controlled substance, and the other charge was nolle prosequi \n(dismissed). Imposition of sentence was suspended for one year conditioned upon \nApplicant\u2019s good behavior through 12 months of probation. His probation included drug \ntesting and 100 hours of community service. (Tr. at 59-67, 87; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1, 4, 5; AE 1, 4) \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer had an anti-drug policy that prohibited illegal drug \npossession and use. His supervisor testified that Applicant had access to sensitive \ninformation, but he did not have access to classified information. Applicant asserted that \nhe applied for a security clearance, but he was never informed that he had a security \nclearance, and he never knew that he had a security clearance. (Tr. at 24-28, 49-52, 78, \n90-98; GE 4, 7) \n \n                                                          \n1 See https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/mdma-ecstasymolly.   \n\n \n3 \n \nHowever, in a May 2015 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \nApplicant wrote that he was investigated for a secret clearance with the date of action of \n\u201c04/2014.\u201d He added: \u201cDate of Action is when the investigation was initiated, not when \nthe clearance was granted. But I do have an active secret clearance.\u201d Additionally, in \nthe resume he submitted to his current employer, he wrote that he had a \u201cSecret \nClearance with DOD Suitability.\u201d2 (GE 2, 6)  \n \nApplicant completed all the terms of his probation, including counseling. His \ntherapist did \u201cnot see him as a risk for future court involvement.\u201d The charge was \ndismissed, and he was released from probation in June 2019. He stated that he is \nremorseful for his actions, and he has learned a valuable lesson. He asserted that he \ndoes not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He met his \ngirlfriend after his drug involvement. She works for the U.S. Government and is strongly \nopposed to illegal drug use. He is active in his church and volunteers in his community. \nHe no longer associates with his friends who used drugs. (Tr. at 38, 42-47, 64, 67-75, \n81-82; GE 4; AE 1-4) \n \nApplicant called witnesses and submitted documents attesting to his good \ncharacter and excellent job performance. He is praised for his trustworthiness, reliability, \nand dependability. (Tr. at 14-47; AE 3) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n                                                          \n2 The SOR did not allege that Applicant provided false information about his security clearance. Any \nmatter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be \nconsidered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the \nwhole-person analysis. \n\n \n4 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24:   \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana and MDMA while holding a security \nclearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant used illegal drugs before or after June 2017. \nHe completed all the terms of his probation, which included counseling. He stated that \nhe is remorseful for his actions, and he has learned a valuable lesson. He asserted that \nhe does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. His girlfriend \nworks for the U.S. Government and is strongly opposed to illegal drug use. He no longer \nassociates with his friends who used drugs.  \n \n \nNonetheless, I still have significant concerns. Applicant\u2019s conduct was serious \nand would have continued for an unknown period if not for police intervention. His \n\n \n6 \n \nassertion that he did not know that he held a security clearance is contradicted by the \ninformation in his May 2015 SF 86 and the resume he submitted for his current job. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. The above mitigating factors, individually or collectively, are insufficient \nto dispel the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and \npossession of a controlled substance was cross-alleged under criminal conduct. The \nabove disqualifying condition is applicable.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant has a strong work record and favorable character evidence. He \ncompleted all the terms of his probation. He has shown positive steps toward \nrehabilitation. Notwithstanding, I have unmitigated concerns under the same rationale \ndiscussed in the drug involvement and substance misuse analysis. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement is cross-alleged under Guideline E. That conduct \nreflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 \n16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are \nestablished.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n8 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nThe discussion above under drug involvement and substance misuse applies \nequally here. There is no evidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs since June \n2017. His criminal conduct is now well known, which reduces his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. Nevertheless, the conduct continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct), H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse), and J (criminal conduct).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant, 45, works as an engineer for a defense contractor. He began this employment in June 2019. He has worked for other defense contractors since April 2016 with the exception of a two-month period in late 2017. Prior to April 2016, he was unemployed for about six months due to being laid off. He received limited unemployment compensation income during that period and took a job in 2016 that paid much less than his prior position. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997. He has never married, though he was in a long-term relationship and was engaged to be married. That relationship ended in 2015. He has one child, age 19, who recently entered college.

Applicant incurred a number of debts that he failed to pay in a timely \nmanner. Based upon the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence was insufficient to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his financial behavior. National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 25, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). On March 18, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) setting forth allegations \nunder Guideline F and concluding that it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him access to classified information. The DOD CAF \nacted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n\n2 \n \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nOn April 17, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting three of the SOR \nallegations and denying the remaining seven allegations. He requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On June \n18, 2019, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 10, \n2019, scheduling the hearing on July 25, 2019. The hearing was cancelled and then \nrescheduled on October 1, 2019, and then again on October 24, 2019. The extensive \nemail communications regarding the scheduling of this hearing are included in the record \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit III. The hearing transcript of the proceedings conducted on \nOctober 1, 2019, when Applicant failed to appear, is also included in the record. \n \nI convened the hearing as rescheduled on October 24, 2019. Department Counsel \npresented four proposed exhibits, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4. Applicant offered five proposed exhibits, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough E. I kept the record open until November 7, 2019, to give Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional evidence. On November 6, 2019, he sent me an email submitting \nnine additional documents for my consideration. I have marked these documents as AE \nF through N. I marked that email and Department Counsel\u2019s response as AE O. I note \nthat AE H and I are duplicates of AE E and D, respectively. I also marked Department \nCounsel\u2019s discovery letter, dated May 8, 2019, and her Exhibit List as Hearing Exhibits I \nand II, respectively. The exhibits of both parties were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 12, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 45, works as an engineer for a defense contractor. He began this \nemployment in June 2019. He has worked for other defense contractors since April 2016 \nwith the exception of a two-month period in late 2017. Prior to April 2016, he was \nunemployed for about six months due to being laid off. He received limited unemployment \ncompensation income during that period and took a job in 2016 that paid much less than \nhis prior position. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997. He has never married, though \nhe was in a long-term relationship and was engaged to be married. That relationship \nended in 2015. He has one child, age 19, who recently entered college. Applicant also \nworks at one or more part-time jobs to help support himself and his child. He keeps his \nliving expenses to a minimum. (AE A; AE B; Tr. at 11, 21, 24-28, 79-96.). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment and personal life were stable until 2015 when his fianc\u00e9 \nleft him and their child and Applicant was laid off in October 2015. These events caused \n\n3 \n \nsignificant disruptions to Applicant\u2019s life and finances. He is still trying to restore his \nfinances to a healthy status. Over the past two or three years, he has consulted with \nattorneys and credit advisors. They have recommended that he seek help through \nbankruptcy. Applicant is familiar with Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings, but has been \nadvised that if he filed for bankruptcy, he would put his security clearance eligibility at risk. \nInstead, he has pursued a strategy of disputing his debts with the assistance of a credit-\nrepair firm. (Tr. at 79-96, 103-105.) \n \nGUIDELINE F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, Mortgage Loan Account Foreclosed \u2013 In approximately 2000, Applicant \npurchased a home for about $145,000. In 2007, he refinanced his mortgage loan with a \nnew loan in the amount of $296,989. In 2014, he used some of the additional funds to \npurchase an investment property from a family member. In late 2014, he began to \nexperience financial difficulties, in part because he lost his tenant for the investment \nproperty. He subsequently lost that investment property to foreclosure, which is the \nsubject of SOR \u00b6 1.h, discussed below. With his layoff in October 2015, he could no longer \npay the mortgage on his home and the bank foreclosed on the loan. The foreclosure was \ncompleted in about February 2016. (GE 1 at 32; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 5; Tr. at \n16, 36-54.) \n \n \nAfter the foreclosure, Applicant hired two or more firms to assist him in resolving \nhis numerous financial issues arising from his unemployment. He believes that he owes \nthe bank the entire balance on the mortgage loan, even though the Government\u2019s credit \nreports reflect a zero balance. He has received conflicting information about his obligation \non that loan after the foreclosure, but he believes he still owes all or most of this debt. \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegation regarding the foreclosure, but the SOR did not \nallege any deficiency debt. The hearing record is otherwise silent as to whether Applicant \nhas any responsibility for a deficiency on his mortgage loan following the foreclosure. The \nSOR allegation regarding the foreclosure has been proven. (GE 1 at 32; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 \nat 1; GE 4 at 5; Tr. at 16, 36-54.) \n \nSOR \u00b61.b, Car Loan Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $22,693 \u2013 Applicant \nopened this account in 2014 to purchase a car for his former fianc\u00e9. When she ended \ntheir relationship in 2015, she took the car. He defaulted on the loan in about September \n2017. The lender repossessed the car. He hired a credit-repair firm, which disputed the \ndebt. Applicant provided evidence that the dispute was successful. He admitted this debt, \nhowever, in his SOR answer. Furthermore, he testified that even though the debt was \nremoved from his credit report, he still was liable on the debt. He commented that he was \nworking with the creditor to establish a payment plan, but he provided no documentary \nevidence of that. This debt has not been resolved. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 6; AE \nD; Tr. at 54-59, 77.) \n \nSOR \u00b61.c, Bank Debt Placed for Collection in the Amount of $2,851 \u2013 In his March \n2018 background interview, Applicant told the interviewer that he did not recognize this \ndebt, which was owed to a collection agency. He disputed this debt, presumably with the \n\n4 \n \nhelp of his credit-repair firm, and denied this allegation in his SOR answer. The debt \nappeared on the Government\u2019s initial investigatory credit report, dated October 27, 2017, \n(GE 4) as a collection account for a bank debt. The original debt was probably incurred \nas a credit account for a consumer purchase because GE 4 refers to a \u201cFactoring \nCompany Account.\u201d The debt is also listed on the Government\u2019s December 2018 credit \nreport (GE 3). Applicant has provided no documentary evidence reflecting that this debt \nhas been disputed under the name alleged in the SOR and appearing in the \nGovernment\u2019s two credit reports in the record. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 8; Tr. at 59-\n60.) This debt has not been resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b61.d, Account with Bank Placed for Collection in the Amount of $758 \u2013 The \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports identify the bank and its collection agency. Applicant \nrecognized the name of this bank and claims that this debt has been paid. He testified \nthat he does not have a receipt for his payment because he paid this debt some time ago. \nIn February 2018, his credit-repair firm disputed the debt. The debt remains on GE 3, \ndated December 4, 2018, with a notation that \u201c[Applicant] disputes this account \ninformation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s evidence does not support a finding that this debt has been \nresolved. (GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 9; AE L; Tr. at 60-63.) \n \nSOR \u00b61.e, Cable Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $468 \u2013 This bill is \nfor cable service at an address vacated by Applicant in December 2016. He testified that \nhe has paid it, though he did not have a document at the hearing to substantiate his claim. \nPost-hearing, he provided a copy of a receipt from the creditor reflecting that this debt \nwas paid in full on January 18, 2019. This debt has been resolved. (GE 3 at 2; AE F; Tr. \n63-66.) \n \nSOR \u00b61.f, Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $300 \u2013 Applicant did not \nrecognize this debt, which is presently with a collection agency. GE 4 reflects that this \ndebt relates to a returned check. He disputed this debt through his credit-repair firm, but \nas of the hearing date, he had not received a response to his dispute. After the hearing, \nhe provided a copy of the April 2018 dispute letter. The debt continues to appear on the \nGovernment\u2019s December 2018 credit report. This debt has not been resolved. (GE 2 at \n4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 4; AE J; Tr. 66-67.) \n \nSOR \u00b61.g, Credit-Card Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $101 \u2013 Applicant \nrecognized this debt and testified that he paid it three months prior to the hearing. He did \nnot provide a document evidencing this payment. Applicant\u2019s evidence does not support \na finding that this debt has been resolved. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 67-68.)  \n \nSOR \u00b61.h, Mortgage-Loan Account Foreclosed with a Deficiency of $57,096 \u2013 As \nnoted, Applicant purchased an investment property from a relative in 2014 using funds \nhe borrowed against the equity in his home. He initially testified that the purchase price \nwas $110,000. He subsequently testified that he paid $90,000 for the house. He made a \n$35,000 or $40,000 down payment. He borrowed an additional $57,000 from a mortgage \nlender. Following the closing, his cousin rented the property, but only lived there eight or \nnine months. The property was vacant before the end of 2014. Applicant managed the \n\n5 \n \nproperty on his own and was unable to find a new tenant. In 2015, he defaulted on the \nmortgage payment on the investment property. Following the lender\u2019s foreclosure, he \nbelieves he owes a deficiency of about $55,000. Applicant has never made any payments \non this debt. GE 4 reflects an account balance of $57,054. In his March 2018 background \ninterview, he reportedly stated that he was working with his credit-repair firm to develop \na payment plan. After the hearing, he submitted a copy of a May 3, 2018 email from that \nfirm in which it requested that this debt be validated by the mortgage lender. No further \ninformation or documentation was presented. Applicant admitted this foreclosure and \ndeficiency debt in his April 17, 2019 SOR answer. This debt has not been resolved. (GE \n2 at 3; GE 4 at 3; AE K; Tr. at 68-76.) \n \nSOR \u00b61.i, Communications Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $584 \u2013 \nApplicant opened this account in 2009 and defaulted on it in 2017. He testified that he \npaid this bill and that it was erroneously included on his credit report. He was unable to \nlocate any documentation to prove that he paid this bill. His credit-repair firm disputed the \nbill, and it was removed from his credit report on January 8, 2018, according to \ndocumentation provided by Applicant after the hearing. The debt does not appear on GE \n3, the Government\u2019s December 2018 credit report. The evidence supports a finding that \nthis debt has been resolved. (GE 3; GE 4 at 4; AE H; Tr. 76-78.) \n \nSOR \u00b61.j, Communications Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $1,513 \n\u2013 This account belonged to his former fianc\u00e9. He closed the account, and in 2017, it \nbecame delinquent and was referred to a collection agency. He is disputing the amount \nof the debt, although he does not claim that he paid this debt. It was removed from his \ncredit report in January 2018 and does not appear in GE 3. The evidence does not support \na finding that this debt has been resolved. (GE 3; GE 4 at 9; AE G; Tr. at 78-79.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n6 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n7 \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response, his testimony, and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline for the ten SOR allegations: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent and frequent. His \nfinancial difficulties initially arose when he lost a tenant in his investment property. His \nproblems were then compounded when he was laid off in October 2015 and was \nunemployed until April 2016. He also incurred a period of unemployment in late 2017. \nWhile none of these events are particularly unusual, they did cause Applicant significant \nhardship. Once he found new employment, he did not try to repay his creditors. Instead, \n\n8 \n \nhe hired a credit-repair company to dispute his debts. His actions casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment were \ncircumstances beyond his control. There was little he could do to avoid the foreclosure \non his residence due to his extended unemployment. He received limited unemployment \nbenefits, and he lacked other financial resources at the time of his unemployment.  \n \n \nI note that SOR \u00b61.a does not allege that Applicant owes a deficiency on his home \nmortgage following the 2016 foreclosure. Presumably, the lender resold the property, \nreducing its loss on the loan or possibly breaking even. Applicant has received \ninconsistent advice on this issue. The record evidence does not establish that he has any \nresidual liability to the mortgage lender. There is also a possibility that a state anti-\ndeficiency statute may bar the lender from seeking repayment of any deficiency. I \nconclude that the record does not establish that Applicant has any further obligation to \nthis creditor. \n \nApplicant did not, however, act responsibly with respect to the other potentially \ndisqualifying debts identified in the SOR. His efforts to dispute and remove bills from his \ncredit report may have been an appropriate strategy to improve his credit score, but the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns extend beyond a simple credit score. At the same time, \nthe Government is not seeking repayment of all outstanding debts as a condition of \nreceiving or continuing a security clearance. A proper national security eligibility analysis \nseeks to determine whether under all of the circumstances, an applicant acted \nresponsibly in seeking to honor his commitments to his creditors. Applicant has not \ncarried his burden of meeting that standard under this mitigating condition with respect to \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, 1.f through 1.h, and 1.j. Applicant produced no \nevidence that he made any attempt to contact the creditors holding those debts for the \npurpose of making payment arrangements. He also provided no evidence of a plan to \naddress these debts other than to dispute them, which is insufficient. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is only partially established. Applicant sought counselling from both \nattorneys and credit advisors. Unfortunately, the advice he received did not result in the \nresolution of his debts or clear indications that his financial problems are under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant has provided evidence that he has \npaid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.i.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is only partially established. Applicant presented evidence that he is \ndisputing debts through his credit-repair firm. He has not, however, established that he \nhas a good-faith basis to dispute the debts he has disputed. The removal of a debt from \na credit report is not the same as the extinguishment of the debt. See ADP Case No. 17-\n00586 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2018) (\u201cThe fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit \nreport does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of \nthe debt.\u201d) Applicant recognized this in connection with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, \n\n9 \n \nwhich he successfully disputed and had removed from his credit report, yet he \nacknowledged that he remains responsible for that debt.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment. Applicant experienced \nunfortunate circumstances in 2014 and 2015 that understandably caused him to \nexperience some financial hardships. While he sought counsel from various sources, he \ndid not pursue the simplest remedy, which is to develop a plan to work with his creditors \nto enter into repayment agreements consistent with his available financial resources. He \nis sufficiently mature and well educated to have been able to know what was expected of \nan adult with the significant responsibilities of raising a child, having an engineering \nposition with a government contractor, and holding a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to address the security concerns \nraised by his financial circumstances since 2015. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all of the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his financial delinquencies. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit 1.)  On June 28, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption; \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse; and Guideline J, Criminal \nConduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 24, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 25, 2019.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 6, \n2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 3, 2019.  The \nGovernment offered eight exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 8, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered one exhibit, referred to as \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A, which was admitted without objection.  Applicant also testified on \nhis own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 11, \n2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 37 years old, married a second time, and has no children.  He has a \nhigh school diploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Assembler V. He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  Applicant \nserved in the U.S. Navy on active duty from 2005 to 2008 and was honorably \ndischarged as a Third Class Petty Officer, E-4.    \n \nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption  \n \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in excessive alcohol \nconsumption that often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  He has \nbeen arrested for drunk driving on five separate occasions over the past fifteen years.  \nHe was first arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) in August 2004.  He pled guilty \nto the offense.  His two-day jail sentence was extended by an additional 20 days when \nhe reported to jail intoxicated.  His second arrest for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) \noccurred in December 2006.  (Government Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 6.)  This time he was \narrested with a child passenger in the car.  He pled no contest to this offense.  His third \narrest for DUI occurred in January 2008.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Two years later, he \nwas arrested a fourth time for DUI.  This occurred on November 2010.   (Government \nExhibits 1 and 2.)    Applicant pled guilty to the lesser offense of Reckless Driving.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent arrest for DUI occurred in September 2017.  \n(Government Exhibit 4.)  He pled guilty to this offense.  Applicant explained that on this \noccasion he went out with a friend to a bar and had some beers.  When he left, it was \nraining and traffic was heavy; and as he was driving onto the freeway on ramp, the cars \nin front of him stopped and he tried to stop, but was unable to before hitting the car in \nfront of him.  Applicant\u2019s license was suspended, he was fined $2,500 and was required \nto have a two-year ignition-interlock system installed.  He was confined for 120 hours, \nreceived 60 days house arrest requiring him to wear an ankle bracelet, and then \ncommunity service.  He was also required to complete an 18 DUI program.  He was \nsentenced to five years of informal probation, which will end in December 2022.  His \ndriver\u2019s license remains restricted as he is only allowed to drive as long as the interlock \nis on.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 7, and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)   \n \n \nApplicant has never formally been diagnosed as an alcoholic.  He has never \nattended an inpatient alcohol treatment program.  Following his most recent arrest for \nDUI, Applicant has been sober for the longest period that he can remember, which is \n\n \n3 \n \nabout 30 months.  He then returned to consuming alcohol on April 2018.  Applicant \nstates that he last consumed alcohol on Thanksgiving when he had a couple of beers.  \n(Tr. p. 50.)  He states that he continues to drink, but has reduced his alcohol \nconsumption.  He further states that he has also found Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings to be helpful.  He has never worked the steps of AA, nor does he have a \nsponsor, but realizes that it could be helpful to him in the future.  At this time, he does \nnot feel that he is ready to start \u201csharing\u201d at this point.  (Tr. p. 50.) \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.   \n \n \nApplicant admits each of the allegations under this guideline.  He has used \nmarijuana from 2008 to at least 2017.  In August 2005, Applicant was charged with \npossession of methamphetamine, a controlled substance.  Applicant explained that he \nwas in his car with his friend when he was pulled over by the police for no reason.  They \nsearched Applicant\u2019s car and found methamphetamine underneath the passenger\u2019s side \nseat.  Applicant states that the methamphetamine was not his, but his friend\u2019s.  \nApplicant was arrested and spent the night in jail.  The next day, he was administered a \ndrug test and it came back clean.  Applicant then went to court and believes the matter \nwas dropped.  (Government Exhibits 1, 2, and 3.)      \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal conduct, which \nraises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  In 2011, \nApplicant was arrested for driving an unregistered vehicle and on a suspended driver\u2019s \nlicense as a result of a prior DUI conviction.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  He was found \nguilty of driving without a valid driver\u2019s license.  He is currently on probation until 2022.  \n \n \nApplicant states that since he has been working for his current employer, he has \nworked his way up the ladder at the company.  His performance reviews started at \u201chigh \nmeets\u201d and as time passed, he was promoted and they now reflect that he \u201cexceeds\u201d \nhis job requirements in every aspect.  (Tr. p. 63.)    \n \n \nApplicant believes that his current wife has been a contributing factor in helping \nhim become more mature and responsible.  He is now trying to buy a house. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Five conditions may apply: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has a serious drinking problem, as evidenced by his five arrests for \nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  His most recent arrest occurred in 2017.  His \nhistory of five alcohol-related arrests and convictions shows poor judgment and \nunreliability.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security concerns. \nThree conditions may apply: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigation conditions are applicable.  Applicant has tried to abstain \nfrom consuming alcohol, but he has been unsuccessful in the long run.  After various \nattempt to stop drinking, he always returns to consuming alcohol, even though it has \nbeen problematic for him over the years.  Applicant has not taken any action on his own \nto overcome his alcohol problem.  Other than the court-ordered alcohol programs, and \nrelated AA meetings, he has not taken his alcohol problem seriously.  There is \ninsufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  Accordingly, this guideline is found against the \nApplicant. \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains two conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Applicant has used \nmarijuana, from 2008 to 2017, knowing it to be illegal.  There is no excuse for this \nmisconduct, and his actions do not show the requisite good judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information.        \n \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its nature, it calls into question it calls into questions a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.    \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decisions, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b)evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted; and \n\n \n8 \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 below: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;   \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and   \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, compliance \nwith the terms of parole or probation, job, training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s five arrests and convictions for drunk driving, his arrest for \npossession of methamphetamine, his nine-year use of marijuana, his arrest for driving \nan unregistered motor vehicle, and driving on a suspended license, all call into question \nhis judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Considered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct \nprecludes a finding of good judgment, reliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and \nregulations.  To be entrusted with the privilege of holding a security clearance, \napplicants are expected to abide by all laws, regulations and policies that apply to them.  \nApplicant has clearly ignored the law many times and simply lived his life to his \nconvenience.  Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant does not show the \nrequisite character or judgment of someone who has the integrity, good judgment, and \nreliability necessary to access classified information.  At this time, Applicant does not \nmeet the qualifications for access to classified information.     \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G, Guideline H, and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis.  While holding \na security clearance one is expected to show responsibility and good judgment.  \nApplicant has not demonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to classified \ninformation.  This is not an individual with whom the Government can be confident to \nknow that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when \nno one is looking.  He is not qualified for access to classified information, nor is it clear \nthat the information will be properly protected.  Applicant does not meet the \nqualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol Consumption, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Abuse, and Criminal Conduct security concerns.    \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a, through 1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a, through 3.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Her inaccurate answers to questions about her finances \nwere not given with any intent to mislead or deceive the government about those issues. \nHer request for a security clearance is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 29, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nher employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n  \n \nOn August 13, 2019, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for financial considerations \n(Guideline F), personal conduct (Guideline E), and criminal conduct (Guideline J). The \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR were issued by the Director of National \nIntelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June \n8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on November 25, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on \nJanuary 29, 2020. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 10. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibit (AX) \nA \u2013 D. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on February 10, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owes $20,336 for three \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c). Under Guideline E, the Government alleged \nthat Applicant intentionally provided false information when she answered \u201cno\u201d to all \nquestions in e-QIP Section 26 (Financial Record), thereby omitting that she owed the \ndebts listed in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c (SOR 2.a).  \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, it was alleged that in April 2003, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with robbery with a deadly weapon, attempted murder, aggravated battery, \nbattery, and shoplifting; and that she was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison \nand four years of probation (SOR 3.a). Also under Guideline J, it was alleged that in \nJanuary 2011, Applicant was charged with manufacture and possession of cocaine, \npossession of ammunition by a convicted felon, a controlled substance offense, \npossession of a controlled substance, possession and use of drug paraphernalia, and \nfelony child neglect (SOR 3.b). The criminal conduct alleged in SOR 3.a and 3.b was also \ncross-alleged as adverse personal conduct (SOR 2.b). \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations the allegations at \nSOR 1.a, 3.a, 3.b, and 2.b by inference. (Answer; Tr. 12 \u2013 14) In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and employed as an assembler for a large defense \ncontractor, where she has worked since December 2017. Applicant graduated from high \nschool with honors in May 2000 and briefly attended a state university near where she \ngrew up. More recently, she earned an associate\u2019s degree at a different university and is \nnow studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree. She has excelled in her college-level studies and \ncurrently has a 3.75 GPA. Applicant has four children between the ages of 3 and 13. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nSince June 2007, she has lived on and off with the father of her children. (GX 1; AX C; \nAX D) \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s information supported the SOR allegations under Guideline F. \nApplicant began to experience financial problems in 2016, when she left a job due to a \nchange in management. Thereafter, she was unable to work full time due to complications \nof her most recent pregnancy. Between July 2016 and December 2017, when she was \nhired by her current employer, Applicant relied on her savings, personal credit, and part-\ntime income to support herself and her children. She also moved in permanently with her \nboyfriend for mutual support. Despite her efforts to meet her financial obligations, she fell \nbehind and eventually became delinquent on the debts alleged in the SOR. While \nunemployed, Applicant completed college-level technical training that qualified her for her \ncurrent position. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; AX A; AX C; AX D; Tr. 40 \u2013 41, 49 \u2013 55) \n \n \nWhen Applicant regained full-time employment in December 2017, she began \nnegotiating with her creditors to resolve her past-due debts. Starting in January 2019, she \nbegan working overtime to save money to offer the SOR 1.b and 1.c creditors enough in \nlump sum to resolve those debts for less than the full amounts owed. The SOR 1.a \ncreditor has thus far resisted agreeing to a similar resolution; however, Applicant has \nbeen paying $50 monthly since June 2019 to show good faith and reliability in the hopes \nthat she can negotiate either a lump sum settlement or a more aggressive monthly \nrepayment plan. Applicant testified that she planned to apply her 2019 income tax refund \n(she anticipates it will be about $4,000) to the SOR 1.a debt. The debts alleged in the \nSOR are not listed in the most recent available credit report. (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; AX A; \nAX D; Tr. 38 \u2013 40, 55 \u2013 61, 77 \u2013 81, 90 \u2013 91) \n \n \nWhen she submitted her e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. She denies trying to conceal adverse information, and she established that \nshe reasonably believed the debts at issue were not 120 days or more past due, or that \nat the time the accounts had been cancelled by the creditors. During her September 20, \n2018 subject interview, a government investigator presented Applicant with information \nfrom a February 22, 2018 credit report. That information supports her claims that at the \ntime she submitted her e-QIP, the debts at issue were not yet 120 days past due. \nApplicant testified that none of her accounts became past due at all until late 2017. In \nsummary, all of the available information probative of the allegation at SOR 2.a shows \nshe did not intend to deceive or mislead the government by her negative answers to \nquestions in e-QIP Section 26 (Financial Record). (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4; AX D; Tr. \n45 \u2013 47, 63 \u2013 67, 76 \u2013 77, 81 \u2013 83) \n \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her past-due debts, Applicant recently \nengaged the services of a credit-counseling company. Using those services, she \nestablished a monthly budget and improved her ability to negotiate with her creditors to \nresolve her past-due debts. Based on her monthly budget, Applicant has about $800 \nremaining each month after expenses. She is contributing to a retirement savings \naccount, she files and pays her income taxes as required, and she has not incurred any \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nnew delinquencies since the close of her background investigation. (Answer; AX B; AX \nD; Tr. 41, 79 \u2013 81) \n \n \nIn April 2003, at age 20, Applicant went to a local Walmart and shoplifted several \nitems with a combined value less than $100. Among the items was a pair of scissors she \nused to remove price tags from other items before she attempted to leave the store with \nthem. As she was leaving, store security stopped her and she resisted being physically \ndetained. A fight ensued during which Applicant used the shoplifted scissors to injure \nthree store employees. Applicant was subsequently arrested and charged as described \nin SOR 3.a. She pleaded guilty to all of the charges and was sentenced to two years of \nincarceration (minus 127 days of time already served) in the youthful offender section of \na state prison. Upon early release for good behavior, she served four years of supervised \nprobation, during which she complied with all reporting and monitoring requirements. \nAdditionally, Applicant testified that another aspect of her sentence was a requirement to \npay $10,000 in restitution. In August 2009, she turned herself in after being charged with \nviolating her probation after falling behind on those payments. Applicant\u2019s probation \nofficer testified for Applicant, recommending that she not serve any additional jail time, \nand her probation was extended for four months. Applicant finished repaying that debt, \nand her probation was terminated in January 2010. She still owes about $800 for court \nand other administrative costs associated with her 2003 conviction. She will be able to \npay off that debt with part of her next income tax refund. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 6 \u2013 8; \nTr. 42, 67 - 72, 83 \u2013 87, 90) \n \n \nAt her September 2018 subject interview, Applicant volunteered information about \nan arrest that she incorrectly did not disclose in her e-QIP because more than seven \nyears had elapsed since the arrest and the charges had been nolle prosequi. On January \n27, 2011, as Applicant and one of her children were leaving the residence where she was \nliving part time with her boyfriend, two men with weapons ran into the house intending to \nrob Applicant\u2019s boyfriend. Applicant called the police who, after they responded, \nconducted a search of the residence and found illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, and \nammunition. Applicant was charged with the offenses listed in SOR 3.b; however, all of \nthe charges were dismissed because it could not be established that she knew the drugs \nand ammunition were in the house, or that she had any control over those items. Her \nname was not on the lease for the house and she was not yet living full time with her \nboyfriend. Applicant was credible in her testimony that she did not know her boyfriend \nwas involved with illegal drugs in 2011, and that since that event, her boyfriend has not \nbeen involved with drugs or any other illegal conduct. He is employed full time and has \nbeen a good provider for Applicant and their children. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 6; GX 9; \nGX 10; Tr. 45, 72 \u2013 76, 88 \u2013 90) \n \n \nApplicant was credible and candid throughout her background investigation. In her \ne-QIP and during her subject interview, she provided detailed information about her \nfinancial problems, and she exhibited a firm and competent grasp of her current finances \nand the actions needed to avoid financial problems in the future. Applicant also provided \ndetailed information about her two arrests, and she has accepted responsibility for the \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nactions and circumstances properly attributable to her. Information from her workplace \nshows that she is a productive, reliable, and well-regarded employee. She also has \nexcelled in her academic efforts and is continuing her efforts to improve her professional \nand technical abilities. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX B \u2013 D; Tr. 42 \u2013 45)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred delinquent or past-due debts \ntotaling $20,336. As of the close of the adjudication of the information obtained in his \nbackground investigation, much of that debt remained unresolved. That information \nreasonably raised the security concern articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nAs to mitigation, Applicant established that her debts arose from a period of \nunemployment that was exacerbated by a difficult pregnancy. Available information \nshows that she did not fall behind on her debts until late 2017, despite having been out \nof work starting in July 2016. The debts at SOR 1.b and 1.c have been resolved through \nsettlement negotiations using money Applicant accumulated by working overtime through \nmuch of 2019. Applicant has been making monthly payments on the debt at SOR 1.a \nsince June 2019 to show good faith in the hopes of negotiating an outright settlement \npayment or a more aggressive monthly payment plan that will resolve the debt more \nquickly. Applicant also has used a credit-counseling service to improve her financial \nmanagement posture through a structured monthly budget, and to help her more \neffectively negotiate with her creditors. Applicant\u2019s current finances are sound, she has a \ngood command of the status of her debt and financial responsibilities, and she has \nsufficient positive cash flow each month to avoid excess use of personal credit. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nAll of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nOn balance, available information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns \nunder this guideline. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant was charged with serious felony offenses related to her attempted \nshoplifting in 2003. As a result, she was incarcerated for two years and placed on \nprobation for another four years. She completed all of her sentencing and probation \nrequirements ten years ago. Although not alleged, I also have considered the fact that \nApplicant violated the terms of her probation when she fell behind on court-ordered \nrestitution payments. Additionally, in 2011, Applicant was charged with multiple felonies \nas a result of her boyfriend\u2019s drug-related activities. This information reasonably raised \nthe security concern expressed at AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nMore specifically, the record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 31 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \n \n \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, compliance with \nthe terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good employment \nrecord, or constructive community involvement. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies only to Applicant\u2019s 2011 arrest. All of the available information \nabout that event shows the Applicant did not know her boyfriend was involved in illegal \ndrugs or was herself engaged in such conduct. The decision by prosecutors to dismiss \nthe charges against her further indicates the lack of evidence that she committed the \noffenses for which she was arrested. SOR 3.b is resolved for the Applicant. \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s 2003 arrest and conviction, the facts are not in dispute and \nApplicant has accepted responsibility for her actions. The last vestiges of her sentence \nand probation expired ten years ago. More important than the mere passage of time is \nthe information about the positive changes in Applicant\u2019s personal and professional \ncircumstances. She has earned an associate\u2019s degree and has a 3.75 GPA in her current \nwork towards a bachelor\u2019s degree. As an employee, Applicant has established an \nexcellent reputation in the workplace for professionalism, teamwork, and reliability. \nAdditionally, her efforts to resolve her past-due debts and improve her financial health \nindicate a sense of responsibility and maturity that she lacked in 2003, when she \ncommitted the offenses to which she pleaded guilty. All of the foregoing supports \napplication of the mitigating conditions listed above. I conclude the security concerns \nunder this guideline are mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s omission of adverse financial information from her e-QIP, as well as \ninformation about her past criminal conduct, reasonably raised the security concern \nstated at AG \u00b6 15: \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegation that she falsified her answers to e-QIP Section 26. \nIt is clear that Applicant did not disclose the debts alleged the delinquent or past-due \ndebts alleged in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c; however, to be disqualifying it must be shown that her \nomissions were deliberate and intended to conceal the facts or to mislead the government \nabout those facts. To that end, I have considered AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nI conclude from all of the information probative of Applicant\u2019s intent at the time that \nshe completed her e-QIP that she reasonably believed her answers were correct. \nApplicant\u2019s defense that she did not believe any of the debts at issue were more than 120 \ndays past due has support in a contemporaneous credit report to which an investigator \nreferred in discussing her debts during Applicant\u2019s subject interview. At worst, Applicant \nwas mistaken about when one or more of her accounts were cancelled. Under this \nguideline, mistake or misunderstanding in responding to the government\u2019s questions is \nnot disqualifying. As to the broader question of Applicant\u2019s credibility, she was \nforthcoming and detailed in her disclosures of other adverse information in her e-QIP, at \nher subject interview, and during her testimony. On balance, I conclude that Applicant \nhas refuted the allegation at SOR 2.a. \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s allegation that the criminal conduct alleged at SOR 3.a and 3.b \nconstitutes disqualifying personal conduct requires consideration of the following AG \u00b6 16 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior. \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s arrests were indicative of poor judgment. Her 2003 arrest also \nindicated an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and it was an example \nof violent behavior. Her 2011 arrest might indicate that she should have been aware that \nher boyfriend was involved in illegal activities, but the record indicates otherwise \u2013 that \nshe was not in a position to know what was going on. \n \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant established that, in \naddition to the passage of nearly 17 years since she was arrested and convicted for the \nSOR 3.a offenses, her circumstances have changed for the better. For the same reasons \nI applied AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d), above, I conclude the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating \nconditions apply: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under this \nguideline. I also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(d). Of note is the positive information about Applicant\u2019s job performance \nand reputation in the workplace. I also note her candor and acceptance of responsibility \nfor her past actions, as well as the good judgment she has exhibited in resolving her \nfinancial problems. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a \nwhole shows that the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance that \nwere raised by the Government\u2019s information have been resolved. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 20, 2017. On \nJuly 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 25, 2019, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on December 19, 2019. On January 15, 2020, a complete \n\n \n2 \n \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on January 20, 2020, and submitted a \nletter and documentation of a state tax payment agreement, which were admitted in \nevidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 21, 2020.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he asked for an additional 30 days to \nprovide documentation of \u201csome progress\u201d toward resolving his tax problems. I notified \nhim by email on March 4, 2020, that I would hold the record open until Friday, March 20, \n2020, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX \nC, D, and E, which were admitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c \nand 1.e-1.l. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d. His admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. In the FORM, Department Counsel amended SOR \u00b6 1.l and added \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m-1.o. Although the Government\u2019s submission requested that Applicant admit \nor deny the amendments to the SOR, he did not. I have treated Applicant\u2019s failure to \nrespond to the amendment of SOR \u00b6 1.l and the addition of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m-1.o as denials. \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old audio-visual technician employed by a defense \ncontractor since September 2015. He obtained a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university \nin June 2007. He worked for a non-government telecommunications company from May \n1998 to May 2015, took an early retirement, and was unemployed from May to \nSeptember 2015. He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant married in July 1995, divorced in July 1997, and married again in \nAugust 1997. He has two children, ages 20 and 13. \n \n \nThe SOR as amended alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $286,943. They \ninclude delinquent federal and state taxes, two delinquent mortgage loans, and two \ndelinquent consumer debts. The evidence concerning his delinquent debts is \nsummarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: state tax lien entered in 2016 for $4,037. In Applicant\u2019s answer to \nthe SOR, he stated that he has an installment agreement and is paying $64 per month. \nIn his response to the FORM, he submitted documentation of his payment agreement, \nshowing that he had made two $64 payments, with 58 payments remaining, as of \nDecember 2019. (AX B.) The document does not reflect when he and the state tax \nauthority reached an agreement, but the timing of the payments indicates that it was not \nuntil late 2019. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: federal tax lien entered in 2015 for $18,437. This tax lien was filed \nfor the taxes due for tax year 2011. It has not been satisfied. (Item 7 at 2.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: federal tax lien entered in 2011 for $38,776. This tax lien was filed \nfor the taxes due for tax years 2007 through 2010. (Item 7 at 3.) It has not been \nsatisfied. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: delinquent mortgage loan charged off for $57,322. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that this debt was charged off and that he had included \nthe amount in income, suggesting that the debt was forgiven. However he provided no \ndocumentation to support his explanation. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f: consumer debt placed for collection of $3,732 and \ncredit-card account placed for collection of $3,724. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, he claimed that these debts are duplicates. Both were referred to the same \ncollection agency, but the original creditors are different and the account numbers are \ndifferent. (Item 9 at 7.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f to credit-card fraud, but he provided no documentary evidence to support \nhis explanation. They are not resolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: delinquent mortgage loan past due for $99,464; in foreclosure \nwith balance of $489,290. The judgment of foreclosure reflects that Applicant owed the \nlender $484,014 when the judgment was entered in June 2019. (Item 11 at 1.) The \nproperty was sold back to the lender for $320,200 in July 2019. (Item 11 at 8.) There is \nno evidence that the deficiency has been forgiven or otherwise resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: delinquent federal taxes of $12,698 for tax year 2010. These \ndelinquent taxes were part of the basis for the tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. They are \nnot resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: delinquent federal taxes of $25,175 for tax year 2011. This debt \nwas the basis for the tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. They are not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and k: delinquent federal taxes of $18,662 for tax year 2014 and \n$33,791 for tax year 2015. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his response to the \nFORM, he stated that he has paid a tax professional $16,000 to consolidate his tax debt \nand submit an offer in compromise to the IRS. He submitted no evidence that the tax \nprofessional has yet accomplished any of these tasks. After the hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted AX C and D, which are federal income tax returns completed by a \nprofessional tax preparer for tax years 2017 and 2018, showing that Applicant owes \n$4,454 for 2017 and $5,852 for 2018. He also submitted a cover email explaining that \nhe needed to file these returns to complete his offer in compromise. (AX E.) There is no \nevidence that the forms were sent or received by the IRS and no evidence of payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l (amended in FORM): failure to timely file federal income tax \nreturn for tax years 2016 and 2017. As of June 2019, these returns had not been filed. \n(Item 6 at 11-12.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his tax professional \nwould file the returns. There is no evidence that the 2016 return has been prepared or \n\n \n4 \n \nfiled. Applicant submitted evidence that a federal income tax return for 2017 had been \nprepared, but no evidence that it had been filed. (AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m-1.o (amended in FORM): delinquent federal taxes of $10,051 for \ntax year 2007; $1,661 for tax year 2008; and $16,624 for tax year 2009. The tax lien \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was based on these delinquent taxes as well as the delinquent \ntaxes for tax year 2010. Applicant did not respond to these allegations in his answer to \nthe SOR or response to the FORM. They are reflected in FORM Item 5 at 23. \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in March 2018, he \nattributed his financial problems to the results of an IRS audit of his returns around 2007 \nthrough 2012 that disallowed many of the deductions he had taken and to being heavily \ntaxed on his early withdrawal of funds from his retirement account. (Item 5 at 13.) In his \nanswer to the SOR, he attributed his financial problems to leaving a higher-paying job to \nbe closer to his family and the expenses of caring for his mother-in-law, who lives with \nhim and is in remission from cancer, and caring for his mother, who has required \nextensive medical care. He provided no documentation of the medical and related costs \nof caring for his mother-in-law and mother. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . Affluence that cannot \nbe explained by known sources of income is also a security concern \ninsofar as it may result from criminal activity, including espionage. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \n\n \n6 \n \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe tax liens alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were filed to enforce the delinquent \ntax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i., and 1.m-1.o. The liens duplicate the debts. When \nthe same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c for Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and past-due tax \nreturns are numerous, recent, and did not occur under circumstances making them \nunlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant attributed his tax debts to having \ndeductions disallowed during a tax audit and making an early withdrawal from a \nretirement account. He attributed his other debts to voluntarily leaving a higher-paying \njob to be closer to family, and the expenses of caring for his elderly and ill mother and \nmother-in-law. His tax problems were not caused by conditions beyond his control. His \ndecision to leave his job and withdraw his retirement funds was voluntary. The financial \nand medical needs of his family members could be a condition beyond his control, but \nhe provided no documentation to support his claim. In any event, he has not acted \nresponsibly toward his federal tax debt. The fact that he did not begin to seriously \naddress his tax problems until he realized that they were an impediment to obtaining a \nsecurity clearance indicates that he may lack the willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his personal interests are not at stake. ADP Case No. 15-03696 (App. \nBd. Apr. 5, 2019). It also indicates that he may lack the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has obtained the assistance of a tax \nprofessional, but his tax problems are not yet resolved or under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the state tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but it is not \nestablished for any of the federal tax debts or his consumer debts. Applicant presented \nno evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other resolution of his delinquent \nfederal taxes and consumer debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant claimed that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.f were the result of credit-card fraud, but he submitted no evidence of fraud \nand no documentary evidence of disputes filed with the original creditor, the collection \nagency, or the credit bureau.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(f) is established for the state tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. It is not \nestablished for any of the federal tax debts. Applicant has asserted that his tax \nprofessionals are working towards an offer in compromise for his federal taxes, but no \noffer has yet been drafted or submitted. He provided evidence that his federal income \n\n \n8 \n \ntax returns for 2017 and 2018 have been prepared, but he provided no evidence that \nthey were filed and no evidence of payments or payment agreements. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s payment \nagreement with the state, and the evidence of some action by a tax professional are \nmitigating factors, but they are insufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by \nhis long history of tax delinquency, dating back to 2007. Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his federal tax \ndebts, consumer debts, and failure to timely file his federal income tax returns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.l: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Sykstus, Esq.  \n \n \n06/09/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant, an accountant and business manager by training, was terminated for \ncause in 2014 for failing to complete a company financial audit as required. She was later \nfound to have used a company credit card for personal purposes on numerous occasions, \ncharging several thousand dollars, without authorization and without reimbursing her \nemployer. That conduct later led to criminal charges, which were dismissed after \nApplicant participated in a pretrial intervention program and paid restitution. Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the resulting security concerns under Guideline \nE (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \ncontinued access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 5, 2017. \nOn April 5, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). The DOD CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \n\n \n2 \n \n \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017, \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 5, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). Her \nanswer included 14 documents, marked during her hearing as Answer Exhibits (Ans. Ex.) \nA through N. On August 23, 2019, the assigned administrative judge scheduled the \nhearing for September 25, 2019. That hearing was postponed after Applicant retained \ncounsel. I was assigned the case on December 11, 2019. On January 16, 2020, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for February 6, 2020. The hearing convened as \nscheduled.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 11. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through N. All \nexhibits, including Ans. Ex. A through N, were admitted without objection. After the \nhearing, Applicant submitted additional exhibits. They included a letter from Applicant (AE \nO), a certificate of completion regarding an ethics course (AE P), her academic degrees \n(AE Q) and 17 certificates of completion for other professional training or refresher \nprograms (AE R). All post-hearing exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 19, 2020. The record closed on February \n20, 2020.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \nThe Government requested that I take administrative notice of the pretrial diversion \nprogram requirements under the state criminal code of Applicant\u2019s home state. \n(Administrative Notice (AN) I). I did so without objection. (Tr. 15) \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a (a cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6 1.b), all \nwith explanations and a narrative statement. Her admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. She and her husband married in 2004. They have a \nyoung son. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting in 1999 and another \nbachelor\u2019s degree in management information systems in 2001. She has worked in the \ndefense industry, with a security clearance, since September 2002. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. 9, \n31-38, 62-64) \n \nApplicant has worked in business management or accounting for her entire career. \nShe worked as a business manager for her first defense employer from 2002 to 2009. \n(Answer; Ans. Ex. B; GE 1) She was then employed as an accounting manager by \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndefense contractor X from 2009 until September 2014, when she was terminated for \ncause. (SOR \u00b6 1.a, discussed below). She was then briefly unemployed. Since December \n2014, she has been employed as an accountant and financial auditor for a defense \ncontractor working with a defense agency. (Answer; Ans. Ex. A & B; GE 1; Tr. 33-34, 45-\n47) \n \n \nAs the accounting manager for Company X, Applicant managed payroll, invoicing, \nand expenses. She managed five employees directly. They included an employee who \nhandled invoices; an employee who handled corporate expenses; a payroll accountant; \nan employee who handled expenses for contract employees; and Applicant\u2019s personal \nassistant. Company X had about 400 employees nationwide. Only a few of them worked \nat the headquarters location, among them the company owners, as well as Applicant and \na few others. (Tr. 39, 64-70) \n \nAmong Applicant\u2019s duties as the accounting manager was the responsibility to \noversee an annual audit of the company\u2019s financial bookkeeping. She testified that in \n2013, the company began using a new accounting system. Applicant said the accounting \nsystem had problems, and she wanted to fix those problems before having the audit \ncompleted by the 2014 due date. The company president, Mr. W, wanted the audit \ncompleted so the company could apply for a loan, and pressured Applicant to complete \nit more promptly. (Answer; Tr. 39-42, 90-96) \n \nApplicant told Mr. W that she needed more time to complete the project, and the \naudit was not completed. In September 2014, Mr. W lost patience with Applicant and \nterminated her for failure to complete the audit. (Tr. 41-42, 89-92, 100-104; GE 2 at 14-\n15, GE 4 at 7-9; GE 8) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant applied for unemployment compensation, \nbut did not receive it. (Tr. 43-45; GE 9) \n \nCompany X had a corporate credit card program. Applicant testified that about 100 \ncompany credit cards were for travelling employees. About 10 company credit cards were \nfor employees at corporate headquarters to purchase items such as office and kitchen \nsupplies. (Tr. 67-68) Applicant had oversight of the corporate credit card program in her \nrole as the accounting manager. (GE 11 at 28, 55-56) Applicant had a corporate credit \ncard, as did several of the people she supervised. (GE 11) \n \nApplicant testified that administration of the expense reports for the travel cards \nworked well but \u201cthe corporate side was very informal, very laid back, didn\u2019t really have a \nformality with them. And we were not required to give expense reports on the corporate \nside.\u201d (Tr. 68) \n \nEmployee J, who worked directly for Applicant, was responsible for directly monitoring \nthe company credit card program. Employee J maintained the credit card files and made \nsure the credit card bills were paid. The credit card invoices were mailed in to Employee \nJ for payment by the company. Applicant described herself as a \u201cvery laid-back manager,\u201d \nbecause she felt she could trust her employees. She did not make inquiries about \nemployees\u2019 corporate credit card purchases. (Tr. 70-72, 74-89, 96, 117, 118)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDuring 2013 and 2014, Applicant used her company credit card for personal \nexpenses on numerous occasions. Charges on her card included medical expenses and \ngas, as well as appropriate items such as supplies and food for the office. (Tr. 67, 78-81) \nShe acknowledged that there was no system in place to differentiate between personal \ncharges and proper corporate charges on the credit card. She acknowledged that, as the \naccounting manager, she was responsible for that failing. (Tr. 113-115, 118, 123) She did \nnot reimburse her employer for any of her personal charges. Applicant acknowledged that \nshe never went to Employee J to see the monthly invoices for Applicant\u2019s corporate credit \ncard account, so she could review them for personal charges. (Tr. 115) Applicant denied \nthat she was having financial difficulties at the time. (Tr. 110, 128) \n \nApplicant, an at-will employee, received the Company X employee handbook when \nshe began the job. (Tr. 118; GE 10) The handbook noted that \u201cAll charges to [the company \ncredit card] must be for travel unless otherwise authorized.\u201d It further noted that \u201cAny \nabuse of the company credit card will be grounds for immediate revocation of the \nprivilege, and for discipline, up to and including termination.\u201d (GE 10 at 49) \n \nThe company audit was completed after Applicant\u2019s termination. It revealed that \nApplicant and three employees she supervised were using company credit cards for \npersonal expenses. (GE 4) Those employees were also terminated. (GE 11 at 28) \n \nThis led to a state criminal investigation. (GE 11) Mr. W, the company president, \ntold investigators that the company\u2019s internal audit revealed over $224,000 in \nunauthorized personal expenses on company credit cards, by Applicant and the three \nother employees, during 2013 and 2014. Of those charges, $29,845 were found to be \npersonal charges on Applicant\u2019s corporate credit card. (AE 11 at 21, 37, 38; Tr. 81)  \n \nApplicant testified at her hearing that Mr. W \u201cgave multiple people the authority to \nuse their corporate credit cards for personal expenses.\u201d (Tr. 120) However, Mr. W denied \nto the criminal investigators that he had given employees such authorization. Mr. W told \ncriminal investigators that \u201cthere was no one allowed to use [a] credit card to purchase \npersonal items.\u201d (GE 11 at 28)  \n \nMr. W also told criminal investigators that in 2008 or 2009, Applicant charged two \ntanks of gas on a company credit card. He said he made her repay the charges and \ncounselled her not to do it again. (GE 11 at 27) Applicant did not start working for company \nX until 2009, but she otherwise confirmed the essence of the conversation. (Tr. 120-121) \n \nInformation provided by Company X to state criminal investigators included an e-\nmail Company X sent to its insurance company in March 2015 concerning an insurance \nclaim related to the credit card theft. (GE 11 at 53-56) The e-mail notes that Company X\u2019s \nestablished procedures required expense reports to be completed for all expenses \nincurred on company credit cards. Applicant and another employee had approval \nauthority on the expense reports. (GE 11 at 53) Only the company president, Mr. W, had \ncheck-signing authority. However, Employee J paid the credit card invoices online and \nnot by check. Applicant, as the accounting manager, had the responsibility to review and \n\n \n5 \n \n \napprove credit card expenses and to reconcile the accounts monthly. The company chief \nfinancial officer determined that no such reconciliation took place. (GE 11 at 54-55) \n \nIn October 2015, Applicant was indicted on state charges of: 1) theft of $29,845 of \ncompany property and 2) illegal use of a credit or debit card. (GE 2 at 29-30; GE 11 at 1-\n3) A warrant was then issued for her arrest. Applicant learned of the warrant in June 2016, \nwhen it came up on a background check performed when she attempted to purchase a \nfirearm as a gift for her husband. She turned herself in to authorities and was arrested. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a)(Answer; Ans. Ex. D; GE 2 at 29; Tr. 48-52, 81-84, 104-105) The other \nthree employees were also charged. (GE 11) \n \nApplicant informed her current employer about the charges. This led to an incident \nreport in the Defense Department\u2019s Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), to her \n2017 SCA, and thus, to the pending hearing. (GE 3; GE 7; Tr. 124-125) \n \nThe district attorney offered Applicant an opportunity to participate in a pretrial \nintervention program. The charges were dismissed in December 2016. Applicant \nparticipated in counseling two hours a week for five or six weeks. She and the other three \ndefendants had to pay a combined $25,000 in restitution. Applicant paid over $9,000 in \nrestitution, as well as court costs. She completed the pretrial intervention program \nsuccessfully in November 2018. (Answer; Ans. Ex. E \u2013 I; GE 3 at 2, GE 5, GE 6; AN I; AE \nA-G; Tr. 52-57, 108-110, 125-126)  \n \nDuring her testimony, Applicant denied that she failed to complete the audit \nbecause she knew that it would bring to light her own credit card misuse. She said she \nwas not trying to hide anything about her conduct by failing to complete the audit, and \nwas not worried that anything would be discovered. (Tr. 102-103, 111-113) \n \nApplicant testified that she will never do anything like this again. It has been the \nmost stressful event of her life. She did not intend to hurt anyone. She is a team player. \nShe acted out of character. She would not put her family through this again. She \napologized for her actions and asserted that she is trustworthy. She recognized her \nfailings as a financial manager. (Tr. 58-60, 127-128)  \n \n \nIn her current job, Applicant works as an accountant and financial auditor. (Answer; \nAns. Ex. C) In 2017, she had an annual salary of just under $100,000. (AE H) She does \nnot hold a corporate credit card currently, but said she is not barred from having one. (Tr. \n123-124)  \n \nIn 2017, Applicant was regarded by her employer as a trusted partner to the \ngovernment and a welcome and contributing member of the accounting team. She \nperforms at a very high level. (AE I) She has been honored with awards for her \nperformance. (Ans. Ex. C; AE J \u2013 AE M) Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation from 2019 \nreflects that she easily meets client expectations and that her leadership and experience \nis valued and highly appreciated. She is highly prepared and leads by example. (AE N) \nApplicant is active in her local school and church community. (Answer; Ans. Ex. J \u2013 M) \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted documentation that she recently took an \nethics refresher course for accountants as well as documentation of numerous other \nprofessional training or refresher courses. (Tr. 142-143; Ans. Ex. N; AE O, AE P, AE R) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . .  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources; and  \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment.  \n \n \nApplicant is a trained business manager and accountant. She was the accounting \nmanager for Company X from 2009 until September 2014. When she began the job, she \nsigned the company handbook, which detailed the restrictions for company credit card \n\n \n8 \n \n \nuse. In about 2009, she used her corporate card to buy gas, and was cautioned by the \ncompany president not to do it again.  \n \n \nAs the accounting manager, Applicant had supervisory responsibility over several \nother employees, three of whom also used their company credit card for personal \npurposes. While one of those employees, Employee J, handled the payments for the \ncredit card accounts, Applicant, as the accounting manager, had supervisory \nresponsibility over the company\u2019s finances, specifically including the company credit card \nprogram.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed the credit card misuse to a \u201claid back\u201d management style at \nthe corporate headquarters, particularly with respect to the expense reports for credit card \naccounts for employees at headquarters (among them the three employees under \nApplicant\u2019s supervision, and Applicant herself). But it was Applicant who was most \nresponsible for this.  \n \n \nIn 2013 and 2014, Applicant used her company credit card for personal purposes \non numerous occasions. This was in violation of company policy, as detailed in the \ncompany handbook, which she signed when she began the job.  \n \n \nApplicant repeatedly asserted that Mr. W had authorized her personal charges on \nher corporate card, as well as those of the other three employees. This assertion is not \nonly uncorroborated, it is rebutted by Mr. W\u2019s representations to the state criminal \ninvestigators in GE 11. Indeed, it stands to reason that the criminal investigation would \nnot have occurred had Mr. W (or someone else at Company X) not contacted authorities.  \n \n \nApplicant was terminated for cause in 2014 for failing to complete a company \nfinancial audit as required. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) She was later found to have used a company \ncredit card for personal purposes on numerous occasions, totaling several thousand \ndollars, without authorization and without reimbursing her employer. This led to criminal \ncharges, in 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n  \nIn one sense, the two allegations are intertwined, as they both concern Applicant\u2019s \nconduct while employed with Company X. However, they are also at least technically \nseparate, on two grounds. First, SOR \u00b6 1.a concerns a performance issue: Applicant\u2019s \ntermination for cause due to her failure to perform an aspect of her job (the audit). SOR \n\u00b6 1.b concerns separate criminal misconduct: her arrest about a year and a half later (for \ntheft and misuse of her company credit card while at Company X). Second, the credit \ncard misconduct did not come to light until after Applicant was terminated (indeed, after \nthe audit was completed), so by definition, that misconduct did not lead to the termination.  \n \n \nTherefore, the two personal conduct allegations are not entirely duplicative. \nBecause they are not, neither allegation can be found in Applicant\u2019s favor solely on that \nbasis.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b both satisfy the general personal conduct security concern of \nAG \u00b6 15 because they are both acts showing Applicant\u2019s poor judgment and unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations. SOR \u00b6 1.b also satisfies AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) due to \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of dishonesty and rule violations; AG \u00b6 16(d)(4) due to Applicant\u2019s \nsignificant misuse of Company X\u2019s resources; and AG \u00b6 16(f) because abuse of the \ncompany credit card is specifically mentioned in the company handbook (that Applicant \nsigned) as grounds for termination.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:   \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct occurred in 2013 and 2014, several years ago. Applicant \naccepted some responsibility for her actions, and provided documented evidence of \ncounseling and trainings she undertook in an effort to show that her actions will not recur. \nIndeed, there is no evidence of subsequent misconduct or performance issues at her \ncurrent job, where she is respected and highly regarded. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) therefore \nboth have some application.  \n \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s actions were a continuing course of conduct and were not \nisolated. Applicant\u2019s actions were also criminal in nature, so by definition, they were not \nminor. They also occurred despite the fact that Applicant has degrees in business \nmanagement and accounting, and has spent her career in those fields. As the accounting \nmanager for company X, she had professional responsibility for maintenance of the \ncompany\u2019s accounting and bookkeeping in general, and of the company\u2019s credit card \nprogram in particular. Also, despite Applicant\u2019s professional training, not once did she \nreview a bill. Not once did she attempt to pay or take responsibility for any personal \ncharges made on her corporate card.  \n \n \nDuring her testimony, Applicant accepted some responsibility for her actions. \nHowever, while another employee, Employee J, was responsible for the actual \nmanagement of the program, Applicant had overall oversight responsibility. In this regard, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about the \u201claid-back\u201d oversight of the corporate credit card program \nrings hollow, since it was she who was ultimately responsible for that very oversight. \nApplicant\u2019s actions constituted a severe breach of the professional fiduciary duty to which \nshe was entrusted by her employer. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant asserted that personal use of corporate credit cards was sanctioned by \nMr. W. This, too, rings hollow, as it was Mr. W who terminated Applicant and later provided \nthe information to state investigators that led directly to the criminal charges. In addition, \nthe company handbook detailed the restrictions on use of a corporate credit card, and Mr. \nW counseled Applicant early in her time at Company X not to use her corporate credit \ncard for personal purposes. This evidence, too, cuts against Applicant\u2019s assertions that \nher actions were sanctioned. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to perform the audit led to her termination in September 2014. \nApplicant asserted that she was not trying to hide anything about her conduct by failing \nto complete the audit, and was not worried that anything would be discovered. I do not \nreally believe this, but there is no concrete evidence in the record to the contrary. \nRegardless, Applicant\u2019s failure to perform an important aspect of her job, in the face of \nrequests from her supervisor to do so, is another example of Applicant\u2019s breach of a \nfiduciary duty to her employer and a disregard for rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and \n17(d) do not fully apply to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns shown by SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the criminal conduct security concern:   \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The charges against Applicant satisfy AG \u00b6 31(b) (evidence (including, but \nnot limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted). \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline J:   \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nThe sole criminal conduct allegation is not mitigated for the same reasons as set \nforth under Guideline E, above. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not fully apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and J in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThis case is not about punishing Applicant for her past performance issues or her \ncriminal misconduct. Instead, it is about whether, given Applicant\u2019s actions, she has \nprovided sufficient evidence to mitigate that conduct so as to establish that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security that she maintain continued eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nParticularly given Applicant\u2019s professional training, I did not find her justifications \nfor her actions believable. Applicant took advantage of the trust her employer gave her \nand caused great damage. Even though her actions occurred several years ago, she has \nproven that she cannot be trusted. The risk is too great that she may again breach some \nfiduciary duty entrusted to her, whether it concerns classified information, financial \ninformation, or rules and regulations overall. And overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to her eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence that it is clearly consistent with national \ninterest to grant her continued access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1: Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant   \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant   \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 29, 2019 SOR, Applicant owed $62,279 in delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2012 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In 2018, his home state entered a $4,267 tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.c) against him. (Item 8) He was $32,100 past due on his mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.d) with a balance of $621,081; $1,341 past due on an automobile loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.e) with a balance of $25,613; and $171 past due on an automobile loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.f) with a balance of $14,491. The SOR alleged he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in September 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). That bankruptcy was discharged in October 2016. Applicant had also filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in April 2009, which was not alleged in the SOR. That bankruptcy action had been dismissed.

He was more than $33,000 delinquent on his mortgage and is delinquent on two \nautomobile loan accounts. He filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2011. He has \nmade little progress toward resolving his past-due balances. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn March 29, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \n \nOn June14, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On August 29, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of ten exhibits \n(Items 1-10). The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of \nthe FORM to Applicant and instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of \nreceipt. Applicant received the FORM on September 9, 2019. No response was received \nby the October 10, 2019 deadline. On November 21, 2019, the case was assigned to me to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 5, a summary report of a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on October 18, 2017. The summary report was part \nof the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personnel background report of investigation may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; \nand there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, \nApplicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit \nobjections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, \nApplicant was advised as follows:  \n  \nDepartment of defense Directive 5220.6, Paragraph E3.1.7, provides \nthat you be provided with a copy of all relevant and material information \n(FORM) that could be adduced at hearing and that you shall have 30 days \nfrom the receipt of this information in which to submit a documentary \nresponse setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any \nadditional information within 30 days of receipt of this letter, your case will be \nassigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination based solely on this \nFile of Relevant Material. Additional information concerning your rights and \nresponsibilities is provided in Directive and the cover letter accompanying \nthis document.  \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. Concerning whether Applicant understood \nthe meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se \nstatus does not confer any due process rights or protections beyond those afforded him if \nhe was represented by legal counsel. He was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he \n\n3 \n \nmay request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting \nevidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department \nCounsel and that he has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide for a waiver of the \nauthentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to \nobject to the admissibility of the interview summary report, to comment on the interview \nsummary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the \nreport. In the absence of any objections, I accepted Item 5 in evidence, subject to issues of \nrelevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 29, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nowed $62,279 in delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2012 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In \n2018, his home state entered a $4,267 tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.c) against him. (Item 8) He was \n$32,100 past due on his mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.d) with a balance of $621,081; $1,341 past \ndue on an automobile loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.e) with a balance of $25,613; and $171 past \ndue on an automobile loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.f) with a balance of $14,491. The SOR \nalleged he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in September 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). That \nbankruptcy was discharged in October 2016. Applicant had also filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection in April 2009, which was not alleged in the SOR. That bankruptcy \naction had been dismissed.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted that the debts are \nlegitimate and attributed them to having made overpayments on his bankruptcy. (Item 3) \nHe was unaware that he could readjust the amount of his payments. In July 2018, he \nsubmitted an IRS FORM 433-D, Installment Agreement. The IRS indicated the payment \nplan was being processed and no payments had been made. Applicant asserted he was \nworking with a local tax attorney in an attempt to correct the debt. (Item 3) Applicant \nprovided no documentation related to his association with the local tax attorney or actions \ntaken concerning his tax debt. In his SOR response, Applicant stated he owed the state tax \nlien and was considering working with a local tax attorney concerning the tax lien. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant admitted being past due on his mortgage, and had attempted to work with \nthe mortgage company, but was unable to get a loan modification. (Item 3) Being $32,100 \npast due would represent nonpayment on his mortgage for 14 months. He stated he would \nbe leaving the home following a sheriff\u2019s sale on August 5, 2019. He provided no \ndocumentation related to the sheriff\u2019s sale or any funds owed following the sale. He stated \nhe and his wife had separated, and he would be renting a room and his wife would move in \nwith family. (Item 3)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted being past due on his wife\u2019s vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and his vehicle \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). He indicated that after the foreclosure was completed and they moved out of \nthe home, he would contact the lenders of the automobile loan accounts to work with them \nto become caught up on past-due payments. (Item 3) He provided no documentation \n\n4 \n \nshowing what if anything has been done concerning the past-due automobile loan \naccounts.  \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 3), \nI make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old technology consultant who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since December 1999. In November 1992, he was granted sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI) access. He and his spouse married in March 2005, and \nthey have an 11-year-old son. (Item 3.) \n \nOn August 21, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Item 4) He indicated he \nhad filed for Chapter 13, Wage Earner\u2019s Plan, bankruptcy relief in September 2009. The \nplan listed assets of $640,073 and liabilities of $990,350. (Item 10) His case was dismissed \nin July 2011 due to the inability of their attorney to get the case confirmed. Applicant and \nhis wife refiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in September 2011. They filed bankruptcy \nbecause his retail business, a book company, had failed. (Item 4) Other than stating the \ncompany failed due to low sales and insolvency, he provided no details or specifics about \nthe business or provided any documentation related to the business. \n \nApplicant listed on his e-QIP he owed $6,867 for tax year 2012; $7,049 for tax year \n2013; $12,638 for tax year 2014; $15,962 for tax year 2015; and $14,030 for tax year 2016. \nThe total amount of delinquent taxes listed was $56,546. (Item 4) He listed $45,216 being \nmore than 120 days delinquent on rental property and $101,752 being more than 120 days \ndelinquent on the mortgage of his primary residence. (Item 3) A $101,752 delinquent \nmortgage of would represent 34 months of delinquency.  \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on October 18, 2018, revealed $32,100 past due on his \nmortgage, $1,341 past due on one car loan, and $171 past due on the other car loan. (Item \n6)  \n \nOn October 18, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and an enhanced subject interview was \nconducted. (Item 5) As of the date of the interview, Applicant indicated his mortgage loan \nhad been modified reducing his monthly payments to $2,279 for the original amount of \n$2,938. (Items 5 and 7) He indicated he was four months delinquent on his payments. He \nindicated he owed $66,546 in state and Federal delinquent income taxes.  \n \nApplicant explained his book business failed. He had moved his book business to a \nnew location in hope of better sales. This was not to be and his landlord filed a lien against \nhim. Other creditors demanded payment as well. (Item 5) In October 2011 due to his book \nbusiness failure, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. The plan required bi-\nmonthly payments of $1,269, which by April 2016, would pay off $137,101 in debt. (Item 5) \nThe plan listed assets of $623,430 and liabilities of $1,167,931. (Item 9) Secured debt was \n$839,272. (Item 9) Applicant\u2019s monthly gross wages was listed as $10,416 and his \n\n5 \n \nspouse\u2019s monthly gross income was $1,594. (Item 9) The plan listed $71,475 in taxes due. \n(Item 9) Making the monthly payments under the bankruptcy plan made it difficult to pay \nthe basis living expenses. (Ex. 5)  \n \nIn October 2011, in order to generate additional income, Applicant started working \nan extra job as a deejay. His deejay job generated $15,000 to $22,000 in profit per year \nfrom 2011 to 2016. (Item 5) He failed to set aside taxes to cover this additional amount of \nincome. (Item 5) He realizes he should have consulted a tax attorney when he started his \ndeejay business. (Item 5) Applicant\u2019s income was affected by a loss of the use of a \ncompany car and then loss of $400 weekly reimbursement for the use of his private \nautomobile, which resulted in a loss of income of $19,300.  \n \nIn October 2016, Applicant started working a seasonal/part-time job at a big \nhardware appliance store. In May 2017, he resigned his job when the store wanted him to \nwork full time. He was unable to work two full-time jobs. (Item 5) He is very concerned \nabout the impact his finances could have on his ability to retain his security clearance. \n(Item 5) As of the enhanced subject interview in October 2017, his primary concern was \npaying off his tax debt and making timely payments on his mortgage, rent, car payments, \nand utilities. (Item 5)  \n \nIn the August 29, 2019 FORM, Applicant was placed on notice of the Government\u2019s \nconcern about his failure to provide any documentary evidence to show that he acted \nresponsibly toward his creditors or that he has any repayment plans in place for his debts. \nIn rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant had an opportunity to provide information of his current \nincome, actions he has taken to address his financial problems, and of contacts with \ncreditors taken to address the repayment of his debts. There is no indication that he \nresponded by the October 10, 2019 deadline. \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n6 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \n\n7 \n \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant and his wife refiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in September 2011 \nwhen his retail book business failed. His monthly wage earner\u2019s payment under the plan \nwas so large that it made it difficult for him to meet his daily living expenses. He started \nworking as a deejay which generated $15,000 to $19,000 income annually. However, his \nfailure to pay his taxes on this income resulted in more than $62,000 in delinquent Federal \nincome taxes for tax years 2012 through 2016 and a state tax lien of more than $4,000. He \nwas more than $32,000 past due on his home mortgage before the home went to \nforeclosure in August 2019. He fell behind on two vehicle loans as well. There is no \nindication that he has paid his delinquent taxes or made current his past-due accounts. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nas required,\u201d apply. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n\n8 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant explained that he had to file for bankruptcy protection when his book \nbusiness failed. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant benefitted from the consumer credit extended \nto him by way of his home mortgage and automobile purchases, and he has yet to \ndocument making any payments toward the consumer-credit delinquencies alleged in the \nSOR. Additionally, he owes more than $62,000 in delinquent Federal tax and owes more \nthan $4,000 on a state tax lien. The debts are considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-\n06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. \n13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nA business failure is a situation that implicates AG \u00b6 20(b). Even assuming that the \nbusiness failure, which occurred prior to October 2011, more than eight years ago, was \nincurred because of circumstances outside of his control, several of Applicant\u2019s unpaid \ndelinquencies are owed to retailers and a mortgage company. Moreover, I have to consider \nwhether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. \nSee ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). Applicant has provided no \ndocumentation concerning his business failure, or showing he has reached a settlement \nagreement with IRS and made payments in accord with that agreement; that he has been \ninvolvement with a local tax attorney; or that his delinquent mortgage loan has been \nresolved through the foreclosure on his home.  \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s tax problems started, he attempted to generate additional income \nstarting in October 2011, when he obtained an extra job as a deejay. From 2011 to 2016, \nhis deejay job generated $15,000 to $22,000 in profit per year. In October 2016, he started \nworking a seasonal/part-time job at a big hardware appliance store. However, he had to \nresign in May 2017, when the store wanted him to work full time.  \n \nDuring his enhanced subject interview, Applicant stated he was very concerned \nabout the impact his finances could have on his ability to retain his security clearance, and \nhis primary concern was paying off his tax debt and making timely payments on his \nmortgage, rent, car payments, and utilities. However, this did not occur. He indicated in \nresponse to the SOR that he tried to negotiate repayment plan with the IRS, but he \nprovided no details and lacks corroboration of any such efforts. It is difficult to find that \n\n9 \n \nApplicant acted responsibly when there is scant detail in the record about his income and \nexpenses. AG \u00b6 20(b) was not fully established. \n \n \nApplicant has had ample opportunity to provide evidence of actions taken, if any, to \nmake payments on his delinquent consumer-credit debts, and he submitted no evidence of \nany payments. There is no evidence that he has had financial counseling. Neither AG \u00b6 \n20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(b) can reasonably apply in mitigation. The Appeal Board has \nconsistently held that a promise to pay a debt in the future is not a substitute for a track \nrecord of paying debts in a timely manner. See e.g., ISCR Case No, 09-05390 at 2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 22, 2010). AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant admitted all of the debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nThere is no documentary evidence Applicant has contacted his creditors or has paid \nany of his delinquent obligations. An applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop \na plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously, but he is required to act \nresponsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to \neffectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). What \nconstitutes responsible behavior depends on the facts of a given case. He must document \nhe has established a plan to resolve financial problems and taken significant action to \nimplement the plan, which is not shown in the record. To his credit, he sought part-time \nemployment to generate additional income, and he made his payments to his Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy plan. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nprovide the evidence that might extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment raised by his \nhistory of outstanding delinquent debt. By requesting an administrative determination, and \nthen did not responding to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), he failed to \nsubmit sufficient information or evidence to supplement the record with relevant and \nmaterial facts regarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the financial \nsecurity concerns. He failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide \ndocumentation regarding his past efforts to address his delinquent debt. By failing to \n\n10 \n \nprovide such information, and in relying solely on his explanation in his SOR Response, \nfinancial considerations security concerns remain.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under Applicant=s \ncurrent circumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the future, Applicant may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness.  \n \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014it is \nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)). Applicant has not demonstrated the sound financial judgment \nexpected of a person with eligibility for classified access. It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990) Overall, the record evidence, due to a lack of \ndocumentation, leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations concerns, and I conclude that it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nClaude R. Heiny  \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Myers, Esq. \n03/31/2020 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant experienced past financial difficulties due to circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. His omissions on his security clearance application were unintentional. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on October 13, 2016. \nOn March 29, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nJune 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on April 23, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \n\n2 \n \nMay 21, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on August 12, 2019. On August 30, \n2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for September 26, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant called one witnesses, testified, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through I were \nadmitted without objection. I left the record open until October 10, 2019, to enable \nApplicant to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX J through AX K, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 11, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 41, is an aircraft worker telecommunications engineer currently \nemployed by a defense contractor since July 2019. He has worked for defense \ncontractors since 2016. From 1997 until 2001, he served on active duty in the U.S. Navy, \nwhere he held a security clearance. He and his wife married in 2010 and have two \ndaughters, ages 21 and 9. (GX 1; Tr. 27.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 17 past-due accounts totaling $31,558. The \ndebts are comprised of a $20,111 debt to DFAS, 2 student loan accounts totaling $6,503, \n2 credit-card accounts totaling $846, and 12 medical accounts totaling $4,098. Applicant \nadmits each of the debts and states that he is current on the student loan accounts, in a \nrepayment plan for two of the medical accounts, and that 10 of the accounts are closed. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant intentionally falsified his security \nclearance application by failing to disclose his delinquent accounts. Applicant denies this \nallegation. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. The delinquent debts \nare reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from January 2019 and December \n2016, and discussed in his January 2018 personal subject interview (PSI). (GX 4; GX 3; \nGX 2.)  \n \nApplicant enlisted in the Navy in 1997 for a four-year commitment. While deployed \nin a combat zone in 1999, he reenlisted for an additional six years. He received a \nreenlistment bonus of $32,000, to be paid in several installments. He received the first \ninstallment of $14,000 in October 2000. Shortly after receiving the bonus payment, \nApplicant used the money to purchase a truck. He received a second installment of \napproximately $1,700 in 2001. (Tr. 49-54.) \n \nIn October 2001, Applicant tested positive for amphetamines in a urinalysis. \nUltimately, he received an other than honorable discharge. As a result of not fulfilling the \nterms of his reenlistment, Applicant was obligated to repay his reenlistment bonus. The \naccount became delinquent in the amount of $20,111 (SOR \u00b6 1.n).  \n \nSince 2002, DFAS has captured Applicant\u2019s Federal tax refunds and applied them \nto the debt. Over the years, Applicant also made several unscheduled payments. He has \ncalled DFAS about 12 times over the past 10 years in an effort to establish a repayment \nplan, but has been unable to reach an agreement. On his most recent call, he was told \nthat the only way he could bring the delinquent account current was to pay the balance in \n\n3 \n \nfull. (Tr. 56-57.) In April 2019, Applicant began making payments through an application \non his phone. He has made a $550 payment and two payments of $200. He will continue \nto pay $400 a month until the debt is paid off. As of October 9, 2019, the balance on the \nDFAS account was $12,588 and is not accruing interest. His payments total $9,459. (GX \n1; Tr. 65-66; AX J; AX F.) SOR \u00b6 1.n is being resolved. \n \nApplicant enrolled in college courses in about 2005, under the erroneous \nimpression that his tuition would be covered under the G.I. Bill. Applicant ended up using \nstudent loans to pay the tuition. He fell behind on payments and defaulted on the $3,991 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $2,512 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) loans. He entered monthly repayment plans for each \nloan in September 2017, and the loans are in current status. (AX I.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nare being resolved.  \n \nApplicant incurred $4,098 in delinquent medical debt as a result of medical \nexpenses that were not paid by his insurance. (Tr. 39-40.) He has entered a repayment \nplan that combines the two largest debts, $1,223 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $1,060 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nHis $200 bimonthly payments are automatically debited from his checking account. The \ndebt will be paid off in August 2020. (AX K.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are being resolved. \n \nApplicant paid the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.j, 1.m, 1o, and 1.q and \nsettled 1.f and 1.l. These debts total $1,339. He was unable to find the creditors for SOR \n\u00b6 1.h $117, 1.k $134, and 1.p. $225. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.q do not \nappear on Applicant\u2019s recent CBRs. (AX G \u2013 AX I.) These debts are resolved. \n \nApplicant paid the credit-card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e $515 and 1.f $331. \nThese debts are resolved. (AX G \u2013 AX I.) \n \nApplicant emphatically stated that he did not intentionally falsify his e-QIP by failing \nto disclose his delinquent debts. Applicant was given the e-QIP to complete while he was \nat work. He felt pressured to complete it quickly and get back to work. He was aware of \nhis DFAS debt, but was not aware of the other debts. He had never viewed his CBR until \nhis PSI. (Tr. 42-43; Tr. 68-69.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s previous supervisor while Applicant was in the Navy and current friend \nhas known Applicant for almost 10 years and highly recommends him for a clearance \nstating that he is capable, honest, and trustworthy. Applicant\u2019s coworker since February \n2019 recommends Applicant for a clearance and states that Applicant is trustworthy and \nobeys rules and regulations. (AX C.). \n \nApplicant admits that he did not manage his finances well when he was younger \nand this was the primary cause of his debts. (Tr. 33.) He did not fully grasp the security \nsignificance of poor finances until undergoing the security clearance process. (Tr. 44-45.) \nHe sought credit counseling through several different agencies but thought the monthly \nfees were unreasonable. (Tr. 65.) Applicant has a credit-monitoring application on his \nphone that alerts him when payments are due and through which he can directly contact \nhis creditors. His credit score has improved by 130 points. (Tr. 60.) He also has an online \n\n4 \n \naccount with a credit reporting agency through which he monitors and maintains his \naccounts. He and his wife maintain a monthly budget. Applicant is current on all his \nongoing financial obligations and has not incurred any recent delinquent debts. He was \ncandid, sincere, and credible while testifying. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n5 \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u2026. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, corroborated by the record evidence, establishes two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nHowever, a person can mitigate concerns about his or her ability to handle and \nsafeguard classified information raised by his or her financial circumstances by \nestablishing one or more of the mitigating conditions listed under the guideline. The \nrelevant mitigating conditions in this case are: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n6 \n \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant incurred his largest debt under unusual circumstances that are unlikely \nto recur. Specifically, he received a lump-sum reenlistment bonus of $14,000 which he \nused to purchase a vehicle. When he did not comply with the terms of his reenlistment, \nhe was required to repay the bonus and the accrued interest. He was aware that the debt \nwas being repaid through the capturing of his Federal tax refunds. He also made multiple \nattempts to negotiate a repayment plan, but was unsuccessful. He has recently been \nmaking monthly payments of $400. His refunds will continue to be applied to this account.  \n \n \nApplicant entered repayment plans for his two student loans in 2017 and the \naccounts are current. He entered a repayment plan for the creditor of the two largest \nmedical debts which will be paid in full by August 2020. He has paid all of the remaining \nSOR debts that he could identify. None of the remaining SOR debts remain on his current \nCBRs.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that a person make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \n \nApplicant lives within his means and has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. \nHe maintains a budget and routinely monitors his credit. His credit score has dramatically \nimproved. He now fully understands the importance of maintaining his finances. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties did not arise under circumstances that suggest reckless \nor irresponsible behavior and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. By monitoring his credit and maintaining a budget, Applicant has taken \nproactive steps to ensure ongoing financial stability. Although his financial record is not \nperfect, he has implemented a reasonable plan to resolve his financial issues within his \nmeans, and to avoid future financial difficulties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility\u2026 \n \nApplicant\u2019s omissions from his 2016 e-QIP could raise the following disqualifying \ncondition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant unwaveringly asserted that he did not intentionally falsify his e-QIP. His \nomissions were unintentional, and the result of rushing through his e-QIP. Further, he did \nnot know about the majority of his delinquent accounts. I found his explanation to be \ncredible and consistent with the record evidence, and his demeanor to be honest, \nforthcoming, and candid. Therefore, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n8 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant now recognizes the importance of maintaining financial stability and has \ntaken significant measures to resolve his debts. He has a reputation of being hardworking, \nhonest, and trustworthy. He was forthcoming and sincere during this testimony. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. The Government \nfailed to establish that Applicant\u2019s omissions on his e-QIP were deliberate. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

On April 29, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), which came into effect June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant submitted his written Answer to the SOR on May 16, 2019. He admitted \nthe SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on July 1, \n2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 7, 2019, setting the hearing for \nSeptember 10, 2019. On that date, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 5 into evidence. Applicant testified, and his counsel offered Applicant \nExhibits (AE) 1 through 6 into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s several requests to leave the record open for submission of additional \nevidence until, eventually, December 9, 2019. Applicant then timely submitted AE 7 and \nAE 8, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non September 18, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 62 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1979, and began his \ncurrent employment with a defense contractor in February 1998. He has successfully held \nSecret and Top Secret security clearances since 1984. He never served in the military or \nheld a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; GE 2; AE 1.) \n \n \nApplicant and his first wife divorced in 2001, after 21 years of marriage. He \nremarried in 2005, but he and his second wife separated in 2017. His wife continues to \nlive in their primary residence with her adult special-needs daughter, and he moved into \none of their investment rental properties. Applicant provides full financial support for his \nwife and stepdaughter, and endeavors to maintain an amicable relationship with them. \nHis wife earns no income other than receiving state payments for support and \nmaintenance of her daughter. (GE 1; Tr. 34-43.) \n \n \nIn 2011, Applicant and his wife purchased a condominium (hereafter, \u2018the condo\u2019) \nin Hawaii, where they had been vacationing as a family for several years. The purchase \nwas arranged by Applicant\u2019s wife, and largely financed with a 50% down payment from \nfunds that she had just received as the beneficiary of her former husband\u2019s life insurance \npolicy. They used the condo about two weeks per year for vacations, and hired a rental \nagency to offer it for use by other vacationers. The condo was not a source of income for \nthe family, since the costs of ownership significantly exceeded annual rental receipts. \nBecause it was offered to renters, however, Applicant believed they were required to file \nnonresident Hawaii state income tax returns, and include the condo information when \npreparing their Federal returns. (GE 2; Tr. 37-41, 45-46.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife did not file Hawaii state income tax returns for 2011 through \n2017 in connection with their rental of the Hawaii condo. Applicant volunteered this \ninformation in his March 14, 2019 response to DOHA financial interrogatories. He \nexplained that he was aware of most of the expenses associated with the condo, since \nhe paid them, but his wife exclusively dealt with the rental agency and refused to provide \nhim or their former certified public accountant (CPA) with rental income information to use \nin preparing and filing those tax returns. This lack of information also led to the late filing \nof Applicant\u2019s Federal tax returns for 2014, 2016, and 2017. (GE 2; Tr. 36-37, 40-45.) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant initially responded to his tax return preparation problems by ensuring that \nhe had more than enough money withheld from his paychecks to cover any potential \nFederal tax liability. He knew that the condo lost money every year, and did not generate \nactual Hawaii state tax liability. More recently, he hired a new CPA who was willing and \nable to spend sufficient time to obtain the necessary condo information from his estranged \nwife. (Tr. 32-34, 46, 52.)  \n \n \nApplicant, with the assistance of his CPA, filed his SOR-alleged delinquent Federal \nincome tax returns on the following dates, resulting in refunds, according to the IRS tax \naccount records that he provided:  \n \nTax year: \nDate return filed: \nTotal tax due and paid: \nRefund issued by IRS: \n \n2014  \nJuly 1, 2016  \n$37,085 \n \n \n$11,102 \n2016  \nAugust 7, 2019 \n$35,847 \n \n \n$11,359 \n2017  \nAugust 7, 2019 \n$34,962 \n \n \n$10,653 \n \nApplicant also submitted his IRS account records for the other tax years between 2011 \nand 2018, which documented refunds ranging from $5,431 to $13,530 and totaling \n$40,094. Applicant credibly affirmed that he has never intended to avoid paying his \nincome tax liabilities, and regrets the inter-personal problems that precluded his timely \nfiling of several returns. He chose to over-withhold large amounts each year in order to \nensure that he paid his taxes in a timely fashion while personally incurring any cost \nassociated with his return filing problems. (AE 5; Tr. 33-34, 46.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s accountant completed researching and preparing the non-resident \nHawaii income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2018 on November 18, 2019. After \nhe was able to obtain his wife\u2019s signature on the joint returns, Applicant filed them with \nthe state, where they were received on November 25, 2019. The returns reflected no \n(zero) taxable income for any of the years involved. Applicant\u2019s state of residence does \nnot have a state income tax. (AE 8.) \n \n \nApplicant provided a family financial statement documenting a monthly remainder \nof $2,195 after meeting routine liabilities and living expenses, and total assets of just \nunder $3 million. He also provided copies of his performance evaluations, \ncommendations, awards, and qualifications, which document his sustained outstanding \nperformance in increasingly demanding duties. He also provided affidavits from longtime \ncoworkers, attesting to his excellent character, integrity, and trustworthiness. His \ntestimony was forthright, and his concern for safeguarding national security interests was \nmanifest. (AE 2; AE 3; AE 4; AE 6.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.  \n \n \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \nApplicant and his wife failed to timely file Federal income tax returns for 2014, \n2016, and 2017; and non-resident Hawaii state income tax returns for 2011 through 2017. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying condition, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes three conditions that fully mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties:  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nDue to marital communication issues with his estranged wife, and despite his best \nefforts under the circumstances, Applicant was unable to obtain the rental income \ninformation concerning the Hawaii condo that he needed to timely prepare and file the \ndelinquent tax returns cited in the SOR. He addressed this situation by ensuring that their \ntaxes were paid on time through excess withholding from his salary. Nevertheless, he \nrecognized the need to comply with his return-filing obligations and obtained the \nprofessional financial services of a CPA who could, and did, obtain that information and \nfile the returns. Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is fully solvent, and there is minimal \nrisk of future financial stress or tax-filing issues. These actions establish complete \nmitigation of security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s formerly delinquent tax returns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nhas demonstrated accountability for resolving the tax return filing issues that he and his \nwife formerly encountered. They have now filed the formerly delinquent returns, resulting \nin substantial refunds. The failure to file timely returns did not, in this case, arise from or \nreflect irresponsibility, untrustworthiness, or unwillingness to comply with laws and \nregulations on Applicant\u2019s part. He demonstrated strong character and has devoted most \nof his adult life to successful support of critical national security objectives. Applicant \nprovided persuasive evidence of sufficient income security to ensure solvency in the \nfuture. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress is minimal.  \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nOverall, the evidence has eliminated any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He successfully met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nDAVID M.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 22, \n2016. On March 19, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued her a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Ord.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4,  \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 4, 2019 and requested a hearing. The case \nwas assigned to me on June 14, 2019. On July 19, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for \nSeptember 10, 2019.  \n\n2 \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1-4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant and her husband \ntestified. The documents Applicant provided with her Answer to the SOR were marked \nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-G and admitted without objection. I held the record open \nuntil October 1, 2019, to enable Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments. She timely submitted documents that were marked as AE H-L, and \nadmitted without objection. (AE H is the Sept. 30, 2019 e-mail from Applicant; AE I \nconcerns SOR debt 1.y; AE J concerns SOR \u00b6 1.u (as amended); AE K is a recent \npaystub; AE L is a group exhibit consisting of letters of recommendation.).  \n \nApplicant also intended to submit proof of payment of an additional debt, SOR \u00b6 \n1.n, but did not do so before the record initially closed. I reopened the record briefly in \nJanuary 2020 so she could provide that documentation. She then submitted two \ndocuments from October 2019, marked as AE M and AE N and admitted without \nobjection. The record closed on January 15, 2020. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non September 18, 2019. \n \n \nAmendment to the Statement of Reasons \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.u ($213) to \nconform to the record evidence, and reflect that the creditor is a power company, rather \nthan a medical creditor. This is reflected on a January 25, 2019 credit bureau report. \n(GE 4 at 3). Applicant did not object to the motion and it was granted. Since the \namendment involved a misidentified creditor in the SOR, I gave Applicant time after the \nhearing to pursue resolution of the debt. (Tr. 55-57, 75-76) As addressed below, the \ndebt is now resolved. (AE J) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d-1.f, and 1.i-1.y. She \ndenied the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h. She provided a narrative \nexplanation with her answer. Her admissions and explanation are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record \nevidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. After graduating from high school in 2001, she served \non active duty in the U.S. Air Force, from 2001 to 2007, and in the Air Force Reserve, \nfrom 2007 to 2014. She was discharged honorably with the rank of tech sergeant (E-6), \nand she held a clearance in the Air Force. Applicant has earned an associate degree. \n(GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 27-28) \n \n \nFrom 2009 to October 2013, Applicant worked for DOD as an aircraft electrician. \nShe then went to work for a large defense contractor, in a similar role. She was \nassigned to work at an air base in England. She worked there for two years, until \nAugust 2015. She then returned to the United States, and has worked in her current job, \nwith the same employer, since September 2015. She is seeking to retain her clearance. \n(GE 1, GE 2, Tr. 28-29, 32-40) \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant was married from 2004 until 2016, when she and her husband \ndivorced. (AE A) They have three children, ages 12, 10, and 6. They share joint custody \nbut the children live with their father. (Tr. 26-27) \n \n \nApplicant testified that her financial issues began when she was working in \nEngland. Both she and her then husband, who is employed by the same company, were \nsent to England on unaccompanied tours. However, they brought their children with \nthem as well as Applicant\u2019s mother. This proved to be more expensive than they had \nplanned, because they only received food and housing stipends for unaccompanied \ntours. They also had to pay for visas so their family members could stay with them. (Tr. \n29-30, 35-39) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she and her husband separated when they returned to the \nUnited States, in early September 2015. Her husband took their children to live with his \nmother during this time. In June 2016, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband returned the children to \nher, and she raised them with little financial support from him. This, too, was a financial \nhardship. The children now live with their father, and she pays $163 a week in child \nsupport. Applicant now lives with her fianc\u00e9 and her mother. (Tr. 30, 40-41) \n \n \nApplicant testified that while they were in England, her company was supposed \nto pay for local taxes. The company did so, but at a rate or amount higher than \nauthorized. As a result, Applicant pays $75 a week to reimburse the company. (Tr. 31-\n32) \n \n \nApplicant also acknowledged that she and her husband managed their money \npoorly during their marriage. He had bad credit when they married, so many accounts \nwere in her name. (Tr. 37) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges about $56,000 in medical debts and past-due credit card \naccounts. They are established by Applicant\u2019s credit reports. (GE 3, GE 4) With her \nAnswer, Applicant included a chart detailing her intended efforts to resolve these debts \nover the next two years (2019-2021) (AE E) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($14,561) and 1.c ($9,986) are credit card debts. Applicant denied \nthem and documented that her former husband has been assigned responsibility for \nthem in the divorce decree. (Tr. 41-44; AE A at 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($11,517) is a debt to the same credit card company as SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant testified that she cannot log into the account to attempt to resolve it. (Tr. 43) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($4,888) is a charged-off credit card. Applicant stopped using it in January \n2015 when she \u201cmaxed out\u201d the account. She has not attempted to resolve it. (Tr. 45) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,995) is a charged-off credit card account with a hardware store. She has \nnot attempted to resolve it. (Tr. 45-46) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($1,675) and 1.h ($1,672) are delinquent debts to consumer \naccounts for military personnel. Applicant denied the debts on the grounds that they \nwere resolved when the government applied her federal tax refund to them. (Tr. 49, 69-\n70) AE C includes IRS account transcripts from tax years 2014-2018. AE C shows that \n\n4 \n \nthe IRS applied Applicant\u2019s tax refunds to several federal debts. She testified that after \nshe withdrew from school, she also had to repay certain funds she received under the \nGI Bill. (Tr. 49-51) Both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are listed on Applicant\u2019s January 2019 \ncredit report. (GE 4) Applicant believes the garnishments that resolved them have \nended, but it is not clear which debts were resolved by recapturing of Applicant\u2019s tax \nreturns. (Tr. 69-70; AE C) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($606) is a past-due account to an online retailer. Applicant provided \ndocumentation with her Answer that she has set up a plan to repay the debt during \n2019 with six automatic monthly payments of about $75. (AE F) At her hearing, she was \nunsure if the debt had been resolved. (Tr. 70-72) She settled the debt in October 2019. \n(AE M, AE N) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.u ($213), as amended, is a past-due debt to a power company. \nApplicant resolved the debt after the hearing. (AE J) SOR \u00b6 1.x ($126) is a debt to an \napartment complex where she lived from April 2016 to June 2017 before moving in with \nher fianc\u00e9. She is unsure what the debt concerns. She looked into it initially but the debt \nremains unresolved. (Tr. 57-58) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.y ($1,055) is a debt placed for collection by a phone company. \nApplicant stated in her Answer that she has set up an automatic payment plan. She \ndocumented her efforts after the hearing. (Tr. 59-61; AE G, AE H, AE I)  \n \n \nApplicant incurred numerous delinquent medical debts since returning from \nEngland. These include SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($1,701), 1.i ($982), 1.j ($903), 1.k ($851), 1.l \n($724), 1.m (671), 1.o ($445), 1.p ($438), 1.q ($407), 1.r ($$315), 1.s ($242), 1.t ($216), \n1.v ($172), and 1.w ($148). She testified that this is due to having a high deductible \n($3,500) on her insurance plan. Many of the medical debts are for emergency room \nvisits for her children. She has not established a repayment plan for any of them. (Tr. \n46-48, 51-54, 57)  \n \n \nApplicant earns about $500 to $550 a week, or about $2,000 a month. She has \n$75 taken out per week to reimburse her company, and $163 weekly for child support, \nas noted above. Her other garnishments have ceased. She lives paycheck to paycheck, \nthough she has about $30,000 in her company\u2019s 401(k) plan. She lives with her fianc\u00e9. \nShe does not pay rent and does not have a car payment. She no longer has any credit \ncards. She has not pursued credit counseling. (Tr. 61-70; AE D, K) \n \n \nApplicant provided three character letters from references at work. They attest to \nher excellent performance and leadership skills, as well as to her character and \ndedication. She has a good moral character and a sense of integrity. (AE L) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n\n5 \n \n \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out, in pertinent part, in \nAG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n6 \n \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt in recent years, as established by \nher admissions and credit reports. Her debts are attributable to a variety of \ncircumstances: a history of poor financial management during her marriage; a decision \nto move her family to England without authorization during a work assignment, leading \nto unmanageable expenses; medical expenses for her family after returning from \nEngland; a divorce; and related child care and child support expenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) apply.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant documented that two SOR debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, are assigned to \nher former husband in their divorce decree. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to them.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are otherwise ongoing. They are attributable to a variety of \ncircumstances, as noted above. She did not establish that the behavior leading to most \nof her debts was infrequent, unlikely to recur, or no longer casts doubt on her current \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she and her husband managed their money poorly \nduring their marriage. More recently, they were both assigned to work in England for \ntheir employer, on unaccompanied tours. Perhaps because they had no other choice, \nthey brought their children and her mother with them. This led to increased financial \nexpenditures that they did not plan for and could not afford. Many of those debts are \nunresolved. She has incurred significant medical expenses for her children due to high \n\n7 \n \ndeductibles. Those debts are unresolved. She also pays child support now that her \nchildren live with their father. These debts were incurred, at least in part, due to \nconditions beyond her control. However, Applicant did not establish that she undertook \nresponsible steps, either at the time, or subsequently, to address them. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ntherefore only partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant has not pursued credit counseling. She has not established that her \ndebts are being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.u was not properly identified until the hearing, and it is now resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.y are also resolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to those debts because \nApplicant showed a good-faith effort to resolve them. The debts resolved by \ngarnishment, however (which likely includes SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h) are not found in \nApplicant\u2019s favor under AG \u00b6 20(d). \u201cOn its face, satisfaction of a debt through the \ninvoluntary establishment of a creditor\u2019s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a \ngood-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. \nBd. Sept. 21, 2009). Many other debts in the SOR remain unresolved, including medical \ndebts and other past-due accounts. Applicant has laid out a plan to resolve her debts in \nthe future, but has yet to take real, concrete steps towards putting the plan into place. \nWithout that, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate security concerns arising from her delinquent debts. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n\n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.n, 1.u, 1.y:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d-1.m, 1.o-1.t, 1.v, 1.x:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 36, has been employed in the information technology field (IT) by multiple defense contractors since 2006. He has completed some college coursework and numerous certification programs to remain current with technology. He has a 13- year-old son. He was granted his first security clearance in approximately 2009. (GX 1; Tr. 19-20; GX 2.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant: failed to timely file his state and federal tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); is indebted for two student loans totaling $4,309 totaling (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g); owes $312 for two medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j); and owes $16,215 for seven delinquent debts, which include credit-card and utilities accounts, the balance due for a repossessed vehicle, and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.k through 1.o.). Applicant denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, stating that he has since filed his state and federal tax returns. He denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n stating that they are paid. He admits the remaining allegations, stating that he incurred the debts due to financial hardship and that has contacted the debtors in an effort to establish a repayment plan.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on January 2, 2017. \nOn June 7, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations). The \nDOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, \n2006.  \n  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on July 23, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nAugust 10, 2019. The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2019. I convened the \n\n2 \n \nhearing as scheduled on September 25, 2019. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through J, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on October 11, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nAt the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \nby striking allegation \u00b6 1.c as paid and \u00b6 1.h as a duplicate of \u00b6 1.o.  \n \n \nAt the close of Applicant\u2019s testimony, Department Counsel moved to amend the \nSOR by striking tax year 2013 from SOR 1.a. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motions to \namend. \n \n \nThe evidence presented during the hearing established that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($196) and \n1.j ($216) are the same medical account.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 36, has been employed in the information technology field (IT) by \nmultiple defense contractors since 2006. He has completed some college coursework \nand numerous certification programs to remain current with technology. He has a 13-\nyear-old son. He was granted his first security clearance in approximately 2009. (GX 1; \nTr. 19-20; GX 2.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant:  failed to timely file his state \nand federal tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); \nis indebted for two student loans totaling $4,309 totaling (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g); owes $312 \nfor two medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j); and owes $16,215 for seven delinquent debts, \nwhich include credit-card and utilities accounts, the balance due for a repossessed \nvehicle, and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.k through 1.o.).  \n \nApplicant denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, stating that he has since filed his state and \nfederal tax returns. He denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n stating that they are paid. He \nadmits the remaining allegations, stating that he incurred the debts due to financial \nhardship and that has contacted the debtors in an effort to establish a repayment plan. \nThe unfiled tax returns are reflected in Applicant\u2019s 2017 e-QIP and his May 2019 \nresponses to interrogatories, which include Applicant\u2019s certified personal subject \ninterviews (PSI) from 2018. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s May 2019 \nand February 2018 credit bureau reports (CBR). (GX 4; GX 3.) His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant experienced financial hardship due to multiple periods of unemployment \nwhich include October 2013 to February 2014; October 2016 until December 2016; May \n2018 until January 2019; and May 2019 until the present. Since losing his most recent \nemployment, Applicant has been on numerous job interviews, but has been unsuccessful \n\n3 \n \nin securing a position in the IT field. He has been denied several positions because of his \nlack of experience in certain areas and/or because he does not currently hold a security \nclearance. (GX 1; Tr. 30-34; AX I; Tr. 65-66.) \n \nFrom 2006 until 2018, Applicant had custody of his son. As a single parent, \nApplicant incurred expenses, including for medical care. He did not receive any financial \nassistance from his son\u2019s mother. During Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment, both he \nand his son were uninsured. (Tr. 53.) His son currently lives with his mother, but Applicant \nprovides financial assistance for them. (Tr. 73.) \n \nApplicant bought a rental property in 2011. The house needed significant \nrestoration. He experienced difficulties in the restoration due to unreliable contractors, \nand the process required a significant financial investment. He did not rent the property \nuntil sometime in 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 60.) Applicant acquired a second rental property from \na family member. He used his money to fix it up, and has used the rental income to pay \nthe family member for the balance owed for the property. He owns both properties free \nand clear. He began renting the second property in February 2019. The tenants in both \nrental properties have a history of paying their rent late. However, both properties were \nrented and paid on time beginning in September 2019 for a total of $1,900. This is \ncurrently Applicant\u2019s sole source of income. He and his son do not currently have health \ninsurance. (Tr. 59-60; Tr. 69.) \n \nApplicant did not timely file his 2014 through 2018 federal and state tax returns \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). He testified that he was focused on caring for his son and trying to \nmake ends meet and simply did not file his taxes. During his 2018 PSI, he stated that he \ndid not file his 2016 and 2017 tax returns because he knew that he owed money and \ncould not afford to pay. (Tr. 23; GX 2.) \n \nIn April 2019, Applicant hired a tax preparer to prepare and file his returns. She \nfiled them in April 2019, but for unknown reasons, the Federal returns were not accepted \nby the IRS. Applicant refiled them and as of the date of the hearing, his 2014 through \n2016 and 2018 had been accepted by the IRS. Applicant\u2019s W-2 for 2017 was inaccurate, \nand the return for that year was rejected by the IRS. Applicant received a corrected W-2 \nfrom his employer, and resubmitted the 2017 electronically resubmitted the day before \nthe hearing. Applicant owes between $7,000 and $8,000 for delinquent Federal taxes and \napproximately $2,500 for his 2016-2018 state taxes. It is unclear what his state tax \nobligations were for 2014 and 2015. (GX 2; Tr. 70.) He has not made any effort to contact \nthe IRS or the state treasury to arrange a repayment plans. (Tr. 23-29.) \n \nThe $10,569 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the balance due for repossessed vehicle. \nApplicant bought a vehicle for $32,000 in December 2011. He fell behind on his payments \nin November 2013 while unemployed, and the vehicle was repossessed in February \n2014. Applicant immediately contacted the creditor and offered to make a $6,000 \npayment, but the creditor demanded payment in full of the outstanding balance. Applicant \nrecently contacted the creditor in an effort to negotiate a repayment plan, but the creditor \n\n4 \n \ndemanded $400 upfront and $400 a month. Applicant was financially unable to commit to \nsuch an agreement. (Tr. 36-38.) This debt remains unresolved. \n \nApplicant has two delinquent student loan accounts of $3,941 and $368 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.g) that were opened in 2005. He made payments in 2008, then had periods of \ndeferment and forbearance. The accounts became delinquent in 2015. Applicant \ncontacted the creditor and entered a repayment agreement on September 16, 2019, for \n$85 a month for repayment of both accounts. He has made one payment. (AX C; Tr. 38-\n39.) \n \nOn September 24, 2019, Applicant entered repayment agreements to pay $50 a \nmonth on each of the following accounts: the $2,230 personal-loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.f); \nthe $216 medial account (SOR \u00b6 1.i and 1.j are duplicates); the $172 utility account (SOR \n\u00b6 1.k); and the $1,400 credit-card account (SOR \u00b6 1.o). He also made his first payment \non each account on that day. \n \nApplicant paid the $362 cable bill and the $482 and $1,000 rent balances (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.l, 1.m, and 1.n) in 2016. (AX H.) These debts are satisfied. \n \n \nApplicant has made lifestyle adjustments in an effort to gain financial stability and \nnot incur any more debt. He liquidated his 401(k), he lives with his parents, and he does \nnot own a vehicle. He attempted to sell one of his rental properties, but was unable to do \nso. He also attempted to take a loan using one of his rental properties as collateral, but \nwas unable to do so because he did not have a job. He experienced additional financial \nstrain when a tree fell and damaged one of his rental properties, and although he had \ninsurance, he was still required to pay some of the repair costs out-of-pocket. He has \nbeen caught in a vicious cycle of financial strain due to unemployment. Applicant has \ncontinued to gain certifications in the IT field to increase his hireability. It is his intention \nto repay all his delinquent accounts including his tax debts, which he thinks he could \nafford $75 to $100 per month in payments. He has approximately $500 in his checking \naccount. (Tr. 57-64; Tr. 28; AX J; Tr. 71.) He was credible and sincere during his \ntestimony. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \n\n5 \n \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n \nApplicant has experienced multiple, sustained periods of unemployment, during \nwhich he was a single parent. While unemployed, Applicant became delinquent on his \nfinancial obligations. He also did not have health insurance for himself or his son, and \nincurred some medical debt. He failed to timely file his Federal and state tax returns, due \nin large measure to the fact that he was financially unable to pay his taxes. These periods \n\n7 \n \nof unemployment, and the resultant financial difficulties, were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol.  \n \nApplicant has recently filed his Federal and state returns, but has not contacted \nthe IRS or state treasury to set up payment plans. The day before the hearing, Applicant \ncontacted a number of SOR creditors and entered repayment plans and made the first \npayments on the accounts. He paid three of the SOR debts in 2016. Applicant has made \nlifestyle changes to prevent further indebtedness. \n \nHowever, Applicant remains in the tenuous financial situation. He currently has \nboth his rental properties rented for $1,900, but the tenants have been unreliable in the \npast and there is no guarantee that this rental income is sustainable. While he owns both \nactive properties out right, he was unable to sell one of the properties and has been \nunable to borrow against either. He experienced out-of-pocket expenses when a tree fell \nand damaged one of the houses. He does not have the financial resources to weather \nunanticipated expenses. Additionally, he does not have any immediate employment \nopportunities. \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s contact with his creditors and his entering into repayment plans \nare representative of the good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts, at the time \nof the hearing, he had only made one payment on each account. This is simply not \nenough to establish a track record of repayment. Additionally, Applicant has not entered \nany type of repayment agreements with the IRS or the state treasury. He has been unable \nto negotiate a repayment plan for the balance due on his repossessed vehicle. Despite \nthe applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his failure to timely file his tax returns, delinquent accounts, and overall financial \ninstability. \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant was first granted a security clearance in 2009. His efforts to continue to \nimprove his knowledge of the IT field by gaining certifications is commendable.

She did not \nmitigate the resulting personal conduct security concerns. A psychological evaluation \ndetermined that she has a personality disorder, which impairs her judgment. She did not \nmitigate the resulting psychological conditions security concerns. National security \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 13, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017.  \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (AR) four times: July, 31, 2019 (AR-1); \nAugust 29, 2019 (AR-2); October 12, 2019 (AR-3); and post-hearing April 3, 2020 (AR-\n4), which is marked as AE F. She included a request for a hearing before an administrative \njudge in her AR-3. On January 15, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) assigned the case to me. On January 21, 2020, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nsetting the case for February 12, 2020. The case was heard as scheduled. Department \nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence, and called one \nwitness. Applicant testified, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D into \nevidence. All exhibits were admitted.  \n \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 24, 2020. The record \nremained open until March 6, 2020, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \nevidence. Post-hearing, Department Counsel submitted GE 8, which I admitted into the \nrecord on March 10, 2020, without objection. \n \nApplicant subsequently requested that she be given additional time to submit a \npsychological evaluation. Chief Judge Erin Hogan, acting in my stead, granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest and extended the closure of the record to April 3, 2020. I subsequently ordered \nthat Department Counsel be given until April 20, 2020, to file a response to Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing submissions. Both parties complied with the ordered deadlines. Applicant \ntimely submitted three exhibits that I marked AE E through AE G. They are admitted into \nthe record without objection. Applicant also submitted a Clinical Neuropsychological \nEvaluation, performed in March 2020 that I marked as AE H. \n \nDepartment Counsel objected to the admission of AE H.1 Department Counsel \nargued that it should not be admitted on the basis of its timeliness. She also challenged \nthe qualifications of the evaluator, the factual basis for the conclusions, and the focus of \nthe evaluation. The objection is overruled and AE H is admitted into evidence.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s Background \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old and married for 18 years. She has a high school \neducation. She has taken college courses, but has not earned any college degrees. (Tr. \n92-93) \n \n \nApplicant submitted her first Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) in July 2014. She did not receive a security clearance after submitting \nit. She submitted a second e-QIP in May 2017. She thinks she might have been granted \nan interim clearance after this submission, but is unsure. (Tr. 93-94) There is no evidence \nthat she was granted a security clearance. \n \n                                            \n1 I marked the Government\u2019s Response to Applicant\u2019s Submission of Independent Psychological Evaluation \nas Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant has worked as a background investigator for five federal contractors. \nFrom February 2015 to March 2015, Applicant worked for Contractor 1. She was \ninvoluntarily terminated from that position. (Tr. 113) From July 2015 to May 2016, she \nworked for Contractor 2. She was involuntarily terminated in May 2016 from that position. \nFrom September 2016 to December 2019, she worked for Contractor 3. (GE 1) From July \n2017 up to the date of this hearing, she has intermittently worked for Contractor 4 and \nContractor 5 while awaiting a security clearance. (Tr. 95-101; GE 1; AE C) \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nAs part of her background investigation, Applicant was interviewed three times by \na special agent (SA) from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM): twice in June \n2018 and once in September 2018. SA testified that another agent was with her for each \nof the three interviews. (Tr. 31, 41, 45)  \n \n \nThe June 2019 SOR alleged the following: six instances in which Applicant falsified \ninformation on her 2014 and 2017 e-QIPs; one instance in which she falsified information \non a resume she submitted to a contractor; and one instance in which she was terminated \nfrom a position for representing herself as an FBI employee. Applicant denied all \nallegations that she intentionally attempted to mislead the Government about her \nbackground. (Tr. 102; AR-1, AR-2, AR-3, AE F) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.b: Under the educational section of her June 2014 e-QIP, \nApplicant asserted that she received four masters\u2019 degrees from California State \nUniversity (CSU): in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. She also asserted that she received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree from Chapman University in 2005, and one from the University of \nIllinois in 1991. In her May 2017 e-QIP, she listed the identical information about her \neducational background. (GE 1, GE 2) While testifying, she admitted that she has not \nearned a master\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 92-93, 102, 134, 127)  \n \n \nDuring her first interview with SA, Applicant told SA that her highest degree was a \nbachelor\u2019s degree from Chapman University. She explained to SA that she listed the four \nmaster\u2019s degree by mistake, and said she had received master-level certificates. (Tr. 67) \nShe later admitted to SA that she did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 50) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she made mistakes when she completed her e-QIPs. She \nattributed the mistakes to problems she had with the connectivity of her computer while \nworking on the e-QIPs. She said she also rushed through them. (Tr. 135) She stated it \nwas an oversight on her part when she failed to review the e-QIPs before she submitted \nthem to the Government. (Tr. 145) She claimed that she mistakenly listed bachelor and \nmaster certificates as degrees because she had trouble with the drop-down menus in the \ne-QIP. (Tr. 48, 102) SA said there is no \u201ccertificate\u201d category in Section 12\u2019s educational \nbackground inquiry on the e-QIPs. (Tr. 49) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she used her 2014 e-QIP as the template for completing \nher 2017 e-QIP, and did not review the 2017 e-QIP for inaccuracies before submitting it. \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nShe said she was in a hurry to complete it because she had limited time to do so. (Tr. \n128-129) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Under the employment section of her May 2017 SCA, Applicant did not \ndisclose that she was involuntarily terminated by Contractor 2 in May 2016. Applicant \ndenied that she falsified any facts regarding that termination. She stated she did not \nreceive a termination notice from Contractor 2 explaining the reason for her termination. \nHowever, she acknowledged that she knew it related to a badge incident at the \nDepartment of Veteran Affairs (VA) health center, for which she said she was falsely \naccused. She reiterated that she was having connections problems with her e-QIP, and \nrushed to complete it, which lead to inaccuracies.2 (Tr. 112)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Under the employment section of her May 2017 SCA, Applicant did not \ndisclose that she was involuntarily terminated by Contractor 1 in March 2015. Applicant \nacknowledged that she worked for Contractor 1 from February to March 2015. She denied \nthat she intentionally failed to disclose the requested information. (Tr. 113-114) She said \nthe error in not disclosing that information was an \u201cunintentional oversight.\u201d (Tr. 114) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Under the employment section of her May 2017 e-QIP, Applicant stated \nthat she was employed by the \u201cU.S. Marine Corps as a Field Security Specialist from \nAugust 2009 \u2013 January 2011.\u201d (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant said she should have stated that she performed volunteer activities for \nthe Marine Corps (Marines) and should not have stated she was a field specialist for the \norganization. She said that she should not have listed the Marines as her employer, but \nrather the Heroes of Freedom Foundation, for whom she performed volunteer security \nwork at national sports events. She said those were typographical errors. (Tr. 116) In her \nAR-1, she said she was having connectivity problems while completing the e-QIP. She \nsaid the volunteer organization was composed of retired military members and their \nspouses. (AR-1) \n \n \nApplicant also listed \u201cEnd of tour of duty\u201d as the reason she left her employment \nwith the Marines. (GE 1) She explained that she used that language because the national \nsports team for whom she volunteered to work was no longer in the play-offs. She said it \nwas the end of the season for them. (Tr. 115-117)  \n \n \nDuring her interview with SA in September 2018, Applicant admitted that she has \nnever been employed by the Marines or served in the military. (GE 3 at 39) In her most \nrecent answer, AR-4, she said it was not her intention to represent herself as being in the \nU.S. military. (AE F) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: Under the military history section of her May 2017 e-QIP, Applicant \nlisted that she was in the \u201cInactive Reserves in the Air Force from June 2002 until \n                                            \n2 The facts underlying this termination are set out in SOR \u00b6 1.h.   \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nDecember 2013,\u201d and noted that she received an honorable discharge in December 2013. \n(GE 1)  \n \n \nApplicant also noted under that military history section that she was a \u201c1st \nLieutenant-Civil Air Patrol-auxiliary unit of the United States Air Force-Wing Administrator \nfor Hawaii Wing.\u201d (GE 1) \n \n \nIn her AR-2, Applicant stated it was not her intention to state that she was in the \nU.S. military. She testified that she never served in the Air Force or any U.S. military \nbranch, and she did not receive an honorable discharge from the Air Force. Applicant \nexplained that the Civil Air Patrol is a volunteer organization, which flies security missions.  \nShe said she should have more clearly explained her volunteer role of the Civil Air Patrol \nin her e-QIP. She testified it was an \u201coversight on my part not to go back and take it out \nwhen I was trying to type things in.\u201d She stated that she had connectivity problems while \nworking on the e-QIP and made this mistake. (Tr. 120-123; AR-2) \n \n \nApplicant testified that during her background investigation, she felt threatened by \nSA based on SA\u2019s demeanor, attitude, and voice during the interviews. Applicant said SA \n\u201cacted demoralizing\u201d toward her. (Tr. 136) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: Applicant submitted her 2017 resume to Contractor 3, which falsely \nstated that she had the following credentials (GE 5): \n \n \n1. A Sensitive Top Secret Security Clearance; \n \n2. Earned a pilot\u2019s license and flew various drug interdiction missions with the Drug \nEnforcement Agency; \n \n3. Worked for the U.S Marine Corps from 2009 \u2013 2011 as a field security specialist, \nand provided field security for 16 [national sports games] as the \u201conly female \nMarine on field 20 hours per week;  \n \n \n4. Held the following degrees: \n \n \n    a. CSU \u2013 Master of Science in Biology \n \n    b. CSU \u2013 Master of Science in Advanced Applied Forensic Science \n               c. CSU - Master of Science in Crime and intelligence Analysis \n \n    d. Chapman University \u2013 Bachelor of Science, Pre-Veterinary Medicine. \n  \n \nIn her four answers to the SOR, Applicant denied that she attempted to falsify \ninformation on her resume (GE 5). She stated that it was a working resume and was not \nintended to be distributed to the public. (Tr. 118, 124-126; AR-1, AR-2, AR-3, AR-4) \n \n \nIn her AR-4, Applicant stated that her computer was hacked and she did not know \nwhich resume was on the internet. She was a student pilot and the reference to having a \npilot\u2019s license was a typographical error. (Tr. 124-125; AE F) She clarified that she was \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nthe only female volunteer that worked security for the national sports team in her home \nstate. She admitted that she was never a female Marine. (Tr. 118-119; AE F) Applicant \nacknowledged that her resume, GE 5, contained the same inaccurate educational \ncredentials that she listed on her 2017 e-QIP. (Tr. 103)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that in 2015 she sent Contractor 2 a resume (GE 6) \nsimilar to the \u201cworking\u201d resume (GE 5) she sent in 2017 to Contractor 3. Both contained \nincorrect and false information about her educational and employment background, and \nmilitary history. She explained that after a job interview in 2015, Contractor 1 wanted \nsomething from her regarding her qualifications, so she sent GE 6. She told Contractor 2 \nthat the resume was not correct and was not for publishing. She explained to them that \nshe was editing it. She acknowledged that she sent resumes to Contractors 1, 2, and 3, \nwhich contained inaccurate information. (Tr. 123-126, 152) \n \n \n \nIn GE 6, Applicant noted that she \u201cearned a helicopter pilot\u2019s license and flew \nvarious drug interdiction missions with the Drug Enforcement Agency.\u201d (GE 6) She \nadmitted that statement regarding having a pilot\u2019s license was false. (Tr. 124) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: In May 2016, Applicant was terminated by Contractor 2 after the VA \nPolice Department conducted an investigation that determined she used her government \nemployee badge to represent herself as a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) employee \nat the VA health care center where she obtained medical services. \n \n \nAccording to the VA police investigation, Applicant flashed a federal law \nenforcement badge at staff members and told them that she worked for the FBI. During \nthe investigation, the police learned that she also told staff members at a private pain \nclinic, where Appellant was being treated, that she worked for the FBI. On one occasion, \nApplicant asked for special privileges because she said she was going to Washington \nD.C. for training with the FBI. Applicant told one health care provider that she was a \nhelicopter pilot with the armed services. She told another health care provider that she \nworked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In January 2016, Applicant was \ninterviewed by police Agent F. Applicant denied ever telling anyone that she was an FBI \nagent. She said she had mentioned to a member of the VA clinic\u2019s staff that she was in \nthe process of applying for a job with the FBI, NCIS, and Secret Service. (GE 8) \n \n \nApplicant said she felt threatened by Agent F and told his supervisor of her \nconcerns. (GE 8) She said Agent F told her he would arrest her at her home. (Tr. 137) \nShe also told Agent F that a different investigator, fitting her description, was making the \nalleged assertions around the VA health center about being an FBI agent. (Tr. 137)    \n \n \nWhen questioned about this issue during an interview with SA in 2018, Applicant \nacknowledged that she never worked for the FBI, but stated she had been offered a \nposition with the FBI in 2007. She said that in talking to people, she might have told them \nthat, and they misunderstood her and thought she currently worked for the FBI. (GE 3 at \n29) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nIn her Answers to the SOR, Applicant strongly asserted that she never represented \nherself as being an employee of the FBI. (AR-1, AR-2, AR-3, AR-4) She reiterated that \ndenial during her hearing. (Tr. 131) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a revised e-QIP that she completed on February 12, 2020. \nShe claimed this e-QIP accurately represents her educational background and \nemployment history. (Tr. 129; AE A) \n  \nPsychological Considerations \n \nGovernment\u2019s Psychological Evaluation: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: Based on the Government\u2019s request to assess Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth status and to determine the presence of any psychological conditions that could \nimpair her judgment or reliability, and potentially cause her to pose a risk for handling \nclassified information, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist (LCP) \non February 6, 2019. The LCP diagnosed her with antisocial personality disorder and \ngave her a poor prognosis. The LCP determined that her disorder impaired her judgment \nand ability to safeguard classified information. \n \n \nIn addition to a clinical interview, the LCP reviewed Applicant\u2019s medical records \nand her security investigation file, and spoke to one of Applicant\u2019s supervisors. The LCP \nadministered six psychological assessments, including the Million Clinical Multiaxial \nInventory-4th Edition (MCMI-IV), as part of the evaluation.3 (GE 7 at 1)  \n \n \nIn discussing her employment background, the LCP asked Applicant to clarify her \nwork with the Civil Air Patrol. Applicant stated that she flew many missions with the Civil \nAir Patrol after she obtained a helicopter pilot\u2019s license. When the LCP inquired how \nApplicant was able to acquire the required hours to become a pilot, Applicant corrected \nherself and said she did not have pilot\u2019s license and said \u201cbut I could have.\u201d (GE 7 at 3)  \n \n \nThe LCP inquired about the VA investigation, which reported that she \nmisrepresented herself as an FBI employee to staff members at a private pain clinic where \nshe was treated and received pain medications, and at a VA clinic. A staff physician at \nthe private clinic reported that Applicant was \u201cfired\u201d as a patient for making those \nrepresentations and also prescription abuse. Applicant said she left the private clinic \nbecause she wanted to get off pain medication and the clinic did not assist her. Staff \nmembers at the VA clinic reported that she wore her badge and claimed she worked for \nthe FBI. Applicant denied that behavior. (GE 7 at 4; AR-1)    \n \n \nThe LCP noted that, during her mental status exam, Applicant exhibited a \npervasive pattern of apparent dishonesty. She opined that Applicant\u2019s \u201cinsight and \n                                            \n3 Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-IV is an assessment of DSM-5-related personality disorders and \nclinical syndromes. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \njudgement appeared impaired.\u201d (GE 7 at 5) She stated that the MCMI-IV, a personality \nmeasure, was invalid due to Applicant\u2019s tendency to portray herself in a favorable light. \n(GE 7) The LCP stated that Applicant \u201cwas not willing to disclose or admit to any \ndifficulties in mood or functioning at the present time.\u201d (GE 7 at 5) \n \n \nBased on her review of Applicant\u2019s file, testing, assessments, and clinical \ninterview, the LCP diagnosed Applicant with antisocial personality disorder and gave her \na poor prognosis, as the disorder tends to be a lifelong condition. The LCP opined that: \n \nThe gravest concern regarding [Applicant\u2019s] potential to hold a national \nsecurity position, is related to her pervasive and habitual pattern of \ndeception and dishonesty. [Applicant] demonstrates a total lack of remorse \nfor her actions, and has not shown any insight into her behaviors, or an \nability to change her behaviors over time. \n \nThere are considerable concerns, documented from numerous sources, \nthat [Applicant] has misrepresented herself as being former active duty \nmilitary, as working for the FBI and CIA, as working for the Police \nDepartment with arresting authority, as having numerous degrees and \ncertifications, in which she does not now, nor has she ever possessed, with \nan apparent goal to deceive others, obtain medications and preferential \ntreatment, obtain jobs in which she is not qualified or suited, or generally \nmisrepresent herself to others. As such, [Applicant] meets diagnostic \ncriteria for antisocial personality disorder. (GE 7 at 6) \n \nThe LCP concluded that \u201cthere is a considerable indication that [Applicant\u2019s] current \npsychological condition impairs her judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and her ability \nto safeguard classified information.\u201d (GE 7 at 6) \n \nApplicant\u2019s Rebuttal Psychological Evaluation: \n \n \nIn March 2020, Applicant participated in a clinical neuropsychological evaluation \nto assess her cognitive and emotional functioning. (AE H). According to the reporting \nclinical neuropsychologist (CN), Applicant was seeking this evaluation because she was \n\u201cin the process of having her background investigator license renewed and therefore \nwants to ensure that she is of sound mind to continue performing her duties.\u201d (AE H at 1) \nApplicant also reported that she has a family history of dementia and has noted some \ncognitive changes in herself about a year ago. (AE H at 1) \n \n \nOver the course of four visits during March 2020, the CN administered 13 cognitive \nassessment tests to Applicant and interviewed her. Applicant also completed four self-\nreporting inventories and took a computer-based test for attention deficits.4  \n \n                                            \n4 This evaluation was performed and signed by a neuropsychology fellow and a licensed clinical \nneuropsychologist. \n\n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nThe CN noted that Applicant\u2019s social-emotional functioning scores from a self-\nreporting assessment fell outside the normal range, which suggested that Applicant may \nnot have been \u201ccompletely forthright\u201d in her responses. (AE H at 7) The CN opined that: \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] pattern of responses suggests considerable defensiveness in \nresponding. In particular, she appears motivated to portray herself as being \nexceptionally free of common shortcomings to which most individuals will \nadmit. . . . Accompanying this reluctance may be a tendency to minimize \nany negative impact that her actions may have on other people, and also \nherself. Given the high level of defensiveness, the clinical scale profile is \nlikely to reflect significant distortion and minimization of difficulties in certain \nareas. (AE H at 7) \n \nThe CN reported that Applicant \u201cdenied functional impairment in social/interpersonal, \nacademic, and vocational domains.\u201d5 (AH H at 9) \n \n \nThe CN made recommendations for Applicant to incorporate into her life in the \nareas of medical/physical, psychosocial, and cognition/memory. She did not arrive at \npsychological diagnosis nor did she address Applicant\u2019s fitness to hold a security \nclearance and protect classified information. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n                                            \n5 There is no mention in this evaluation that the CN administered a personality assessment, such as the \nMCMI-IV, or that the CN reviewed Applicant\u2019s security file or the CLP\u2019s report. \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n10\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three may potentially apply in this case:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n11\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to establish disqualifying security concerns under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e)(1). Applicant deliberately provided false, misleading, and \ninaccurate information to the Government in her 2014 and 2017 e-QIPs, which was \nrelevant to a determination of her national security eligibility. She also deliberately \nprovided false and misleading information to a contractor regarding her credentials. \nApplicant\u2019s personal misconduct creates a vulnerability to exploitation or duress by other \nindividuals, as it is the type of activity which, if known, could and would affect her personal \nand professional standing. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides four conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. They are: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant did not \nmake any effort to disclose or correct the various instances of falsified information that \nshe submitted to the Government or contractors. Rather she has continues to deny all \n\n \n \n \n \n12\nallegations and asserts that she made unintentional mistakes on her e-QIPs and \nresumes, due to connection problems she had with the e-QIP software, her own oversight \nissues, and being in a rush while working on the documents. None of these explanations \nare credible or persuasive regarding the specific false information she provided. \n \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct was not minor, but serious and egregious. Between 2014 and 2017, she \nintentionally falsified two e-QIPs and submitted false resumes to at least two government \ncontractors, in order to secure a security clearance and employment. Her assertions that \nshe made unintentional mistakes on the e-QIPs are not credible. Her defense that she \nnotified the contractors that the resume she submitted was a \u201cworking\u201d resume and not \nintended for public dissemination is not convincing, nor is her claim that her computer \nwas hacked. In addition, her statement to Agent F that she might have been confused \nwith someone else who impersonated an FBI agent at the clinic is questionable, given \nthat the staff identified her as the individual flashing her badge. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ndemonstrates an ongoing pattern of dishonesty, bad judgment, and unreliability.  \n \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) or 17(e). Applicant \nhas not acknowledged her misconduct and adamantly denies any intentional wrongdoing. \nShe has not obtained counseling to examine the factors that contributed to her \nuntrustworthy behavior and prevent it from recurring. Given that she continues to defend \nher misconduct, she has not taken positive steps to eliminate vulnerability to exploitation. \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \nAG \u00b6 27 explains the security concerns relating to psychological conditions: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nAG \u00b6 28 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying under this guideline. One may potentially apply in this case:  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \n \nIn February 2019, at the Government\u2019s request for a mental health examination, a \nlicensed clinical psychologist (LCP) diagnosed Applicant with antisocial personality \n\n \n \n \n \n13\ndisorder. The LCP arrived at the diagnosis after reviewing Applicant\u2019s security clearance \nfile, performing a clinical interview, and administering tests including the MCMI-IV that \nobjectively assesses the presence of personality disorders. The LCP opined that \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and ability to safeguard classified information were impaired due to \nher continuing antisocial personality disorder. The evidence establishes the above \ndisqualifying condition. \n \nAG \u00b6 29 provides three conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. They are:  \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 29(b). Applicant is not \nparticipating in counseling or a treatment program. She has not received a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional that addresses her fitness to hold \na security clearance and ability to protect classified information. The evaluation she \nsubmitted in rebuttal to the Government\u2019s evaluation did not focus on her reported \nfalsifications, but primarily assessed her cognitive functioning. The CN who performed \nthat evaluation did not articulate a diagnosis or give Applicant a prognosis relevant to the \nissues in this case.   \n \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 29(c). After completing a \nclinical interview, testing, and an objective personality assessment, a qualified mental \nhealth professional (LCP) concluded that Applicant has antisocial personality disorder, \nwhich is not under control or in remission. The LCP stated that Applicant\u2019s prognosis is \npoor. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s rebuttal evaluation focused on her cognitive and emotional functioning. \nIt did not include consideration of the facts alleged in the SOR, or the Government LCP\u2019s \npsychological evaluation and diagnosis. The rebuttal included personality assessments \nbased on Applicant\u2019s self-reporting, rather than a more objective method. Nonetheless, \nApplicant\u2019s own clinician specifically noted her responses to be unreliable and self-\nserving. The CN found that Applicant\u2019s defensiveness was likely to distort and minimize \ndifficulties in certain areas of her life, similar to the Government LCP\u2019s conclusions.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n14\n  \nBased on the Government LCP\u2019s February 2019 Psychological Evaluation, the \nabsence of a persuasive rebuttal to it, and Applicant\u2019s testimony, there is compelling \nevidence that Applicant has a current condition that impairs her judgment and ability to \nhold security clearance. AG \u00b6 29(e) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E and Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAfter reviewing the transcript and exhibits in this case, six significant issues raise \nconcerns: (1) the scope of Applicant\u2019s falsifications, including her 2014 e-QIP, 2017 e-\nQIP, and deceptive resumes that she provided to federal contractors; (2) the nature of the \nfalsifications, which involve misrepresenting her educational credentials and work history, \nin addition to fabricating a military history; (3) her consistent denials that she did not \nintentionally falsify her 2014 and 2017 e-QIPS or any other documents; (4) providing \ncontradictory and a credible explanations for the allegations, including having problems \nwith the e-QIP software, making typographical errors, working with a hacked computer, \nand failing to review her work; (5) both psychologists, the LCP and the CN, questioned \nApplicant\u2019s forthrightness; and (6) Applicant\u2019s consistent lack of remorse or insight \nconcerning any aspect of her dishonest behavior.  \n \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the personal conduct and psychological conditions guidelines.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n15\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \n    \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \n \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n  Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on December 19, 2017. On \nMarch 18, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 30, 2019, but his answer was returned by \nthe DOD CAF on August 21, 2019, because it was incomplete. He completed and \nresubmitted his answer on August 27, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \n\n \n2 \n \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 18, 2019, \nand the case was assigned to me on the same day. On October 24, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor November 15, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) \n1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not \npresent the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept \nthe record open until December 9, 2019, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. \nHe timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old engineering technician employed by a defense \ncontractor since December 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from \nSeptember 2005 to September 2013 and was discharged under the Navy high-tenure \nrules for failure to be promoted. He began working for a defense contractor immediately \nafter he was discharged. He was employed by various defense contractors and non-\ngovernment employers from September 2013 until he was hired for his current position. \nHe was voluntarily unemployed from May 2014 to August 2015, September 2016 to \nAugust 2017, and October to December 2017 to attend college. He was unemployed from \nNovember 2015 to June 2016, after leaving his job at a gym because it \u201cwas getting rid \nof the attendees.\u201d (Tr. 31-33; GX 1 at 13-18.) He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from an art \ninstitute in June 2017. His educational expenses were covered by the GI Bill. He held a \nsecurity clearance in the Navy and retained it as an employee of a federal contractor. \n \n \nApplicant married in July 2004 and divorced in October 2012. He remarried in \nJanuary 2013. He has two children from his first marriage, ages seven and four, and a \nthree-year-old child from his current marriage. His oldest child lives with her mother, and \nhe pays child support for her. His two youngest children live with him and his current wife. \n(Tr. 25.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $34,400 that are reflected \nin credit reports from January 2018 and February 2019. (GX 2 and 3.) The evidence \nconcerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: child support arrearage placed for collection of $22,636. Applicant \nfell behind in his child-support payments during his periods of unemployment. Since \nJanuary 2017, he has been paying $600 per month by direct deduction from his pay. The \nlast payment was on December 4, 2019. (AX A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: deficiency of $14,562 after vehicle repossession. Applicant testified \nthat his vehicle was repossessed after he missed one or two payments. (Tr. 21.) He paid \nabout $900 to redeem the vehicle. He testified that his payments are current. (Tr. 54-57.) \n\n \n3 \n \nHe believes that he still owes about $10,000 on the vehicle loan. (Tr. 79.) He did not \nprovide any documentary evidence to support his testimony. The February 2019 credit \nreport reflects that the account is still delinquent. (GX 3 at 2.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: secured loan charged off for $725. Applicant testified he incurred \nthis debt to repair the transmission in his wife\u2019s car. (Tr. 58.) He testified that he has saved \nup about $200 to pay this debt and is hoping to settle it for less than the full amount. (Tr. \n20, 22.) He received an offer to settle the debt for about $300, but his wife advised him to \nnot accept the offer and wait for a better offer, and he followed her advice. (Tr. 58-59.) \nThe debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g: medical bills placed for collection of $207, $231, $95, and \n$67. Applicant admitted these debts in his answer to the SOR, but he testified that he \ndoes not know anything about them. (Tr. 19, 64.) He has not attempted to contact the \ncreditors or the collection agencies. (Tr. 86.) He has not disputed any of the debts. They \nare not resolved. \n \n \nApplicant sought and received financial counseling while he was in the Navy. He \nalso received financial advice from his mother, who worked in the banking industry. (Tr. \n67.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified his gross annual income is about $52,000. (Tr. 29.) He and his \nwife currently have a net remainder of about $300 after paying all expenses. (Tr. 70.) \nAbout two weeks before the hearing, Applicant and his wife traded in one of their older \ncars and bought a 2016 used car, borrowing about $11,000 to finance the purchase. (Tr. \n73-74.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has been offered a job in another state. She will be moving in \nDecember 2019, and he and the children will follow her in January 2020. He expects to \nincur moving expenses and to maintain two residences until he joins his wife at her new \njob location. (Tr. 20-21.) His wife\u2019s annual pay for her new job will be about $52,000.  \n \nApplicant hopes to find employment in their new home state, but had not done so \nas of the date the record closed. (Tr. 48-50.) He intends to remain in his current job until \nhe finds employment at his wife\u2019s work location. (Tr. 82.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Navy was involuntary, \nbut it did not cause any period of unemployment. Three of Applicant\u2019s periods of \nunemployment were the result of his voluntary decision to resume his college education. \nThe information about his unemployment after leaving the job at the gym is sparse, but it \nappears to indicate that he left because he was dissatisfied with the job. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant received financial counseling while in \nthe Navy and from his mother, but the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g are not resolved \nor under control.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the child-support obligation alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but \nnot for the other debts. Applicant testified that the repossession of his automobile, alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b, is resolved, but he submitted no documentary evidence to support his \ntestimony or to rebut the credit report reflecting that the debt is not resolved. Applicants \nwho claim that a debt has been resolved are expected to present documentary evidence \nsupporting their claim. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). He \npresented no evidence that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g are being resolved.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has gained control of the child-support arrearage, but his \noverall financial situation is in disarray. The status of the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b is unclear, \nand he admits that he owes at least $11,000 on the loan. His net monthly remainder after \npaying all living expenses is minimal. He recently incurred an $11,000 debt to replace an \n\n \nolder vehicle. He is facing moving expenses and the costs of maintaining two households. \nHe has done nothing to resolve the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

National security eligibility for access to classified information \nis granted.  \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 11, 2017. On \nApril 12, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse). Applicant answered the SOR on April 25, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge (Answer). The Government was ready to proceed \non May 31, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on August 21, 2019. On August 22, \n2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for September 24, 2019, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled.  \nApplicant testified, and one witness testified on his behalf. Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 4 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B were admitted without objection. \nApplicant also submitted four ISCR security clearance decisions, which I marked as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I, and appended to the record. I received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non October 2, 2019, and the record closed.  \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 42, married, and has two young children. In 2001, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering, and in 2008, he received a master\u2019s degree \nin business administration. He previously held a security clearance from approximately \n2003 until 2011. He has worked for a defense contractor (DC 1) as a program manager \nsince February 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12) \n \n \nApplicant started experimenting with drugs while he was in college. He continued \nto use drugs after he graduated in 2001. The majority of his drug use occurred before \n2001, but he continued to use drugs occasionally until 2006. (GE 1 at 52-53; GE 2 at 7; \nGE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 54-55) \n \n \nApplicant used Ketamine two to three times between 1997 and 1998. He used and \npurchased LSD approximately five times in 1997 and 1998. He used psychedelic \nmushrooms once in 1998, and once in 2010 at his bachelor party. Applicant used Ecstasy \n10 to 15 times between 2001 and 2003, prior to obtaining a security clearance. He used \nand purchased cocaine 10 to 20 times between 2004 and 2006, while holding a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s drug use primarily took place on the weekends while he was at \nparties with his friends. (GE 1 at 52-53; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 30-31, 41-44)  \n \n \nApplicant purchased marijuana and used it approximately 15 to 25 times between \n1999 and 2006.  He used marijuana again approximately three to five times between July \nand November 2016. At that time, he lived in a state in which recreational marijuana use \nis legal, and he was employed as the vice president of product development for a small \nstart-up company. He was not considering seeking further government employment. (GE \n1 at 50-51; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29-30, 34, 40, 47-51, 53-54) \n \n \nApplicant stopped using marijuana in late 2016, because he decided it was not \nconducive to his family life. He has not used any illegal drugs since late 2016, and he \nstopped using them prior to applying for and accepting a position with DC 1 in early 2017. \n(GE 1 at 50-51; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29-30, 34, 40, 49-51) \n \nApplicant worked for DC 1 from March 2001 until October 2002, when his position \nwas downsized. He applied for a security clearance during this employment, but was laid \noff before the clearance investigation was completed. At the hearing, Applicant admitted \nthat he probably did not disclose his drug use between 1999 and 2001 when he completed \nthis SCA. (GE 1; Tr. 31-33, 37-39) \n \nApplicant was rehired by DC 1 in March 2003, and he almost immediately received \na security clearance based upon his initial application. According to Applicant, the security \nclearance process \u201cdidn\u2019t really sink in,\u201d and he \u201ccontinued a pattern of behavior that [he \nnow realizes] is not becoming of individuals\u201d who hold a security clearance. He was aware \nthat drug use was inconsistent with his employment at DC 1 and inconsistent with holding \na security clearance. (AE A; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 47-48) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn late 2010, DC 1 sponsored Applicant for a top secret clearance with sensitive \ncompartmented information access (TS/SCI). In 2011, during an interview, he disclosed \nall of his drug use, including his drug use while holding a security clearance. He also \nindicated that he intended to abstain from drug use in the future. Applicant left DC 1 in \nlate December 2011, prior to the adjudication of this upgrade. Applicant worked for non-\ngovernment-related companies from December 2011 until February 2017, when he was \nrehired by DC 1. (GE 1 at 55; Tr. 40, 45-47)  \n \n \n \nApplicant was drug tested by DC 1 in 2001, 2003, 2007, and in 2017. He did not \ntest positive for any drugs on any of these tests. He was drug tested by a non-government \nemployer in 2011 or 2012. (Tr. 29, 45) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor (Supervisor) from 2017 until early 2019 testified that he had \ndaily contact with Applicant. He reviewed Applicant\u2019s SOR two weeks before the hearing. \nSupervisor currently holds a TS/SCI security clearance. He has held a security clearance \nsince 2002 as a military service member, government service employee, and defense \ncontractor. He has no concerns with Applicant\u2019s behavior at work, and he has only seen \n\u201cnothing but reasonable, honorable behavior in the years\u201d that he has known him. (Tr. 20-\n28) \n \n \nApplicant no longer associates with individuals who use drugs. (AE A; Tr. 31, 33, \n52-53) He accepts full responsibility and the consequences for his prior actions, which \nreflect \u201cvery poor judgment and a lack of understanding and respect [for] the severity of \nholding a [security] clearance.\u201d Applicant signed a statement acknowledging that future \ndrug use would subject his security clearance to revocation. He does not intend to use \ndrugs in the future. (GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29, 31, 33, 52-53) \n \n \nApplicant currently volunteers at a bicycle co-op providing teaching and mentoring \nfor an under-privileged local community. He volunteered from 2006 to 2013 in another \nstate with the Park Rangers at a National Monument. He went through a background \ninvestigation and a drug test for this work. Since August 2019, Applicant has sought \nweekly mental-health treatment to address stress, personal insight, and communication \nskills. (AE A; AE B; Tr. 17-18, 35-36) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n\n \n5 \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence established the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nThe burden shifted to Appellant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nApplicant started using marijuana and other illegal drugs while he was in college. \nHis illegal drug use continued after he graduated in 2001. He largely discontinued using \ndrugs in 2006, and he last used drugs while holding a clearance in 2010.  His marijuana \nuse in 2016 occurred in a state where recreational use is legal, and he was not employed \nby the U.S. Government or a federal contractor. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to use illegal drugs after he was granted a security clearance \nin 2003, was a lapse in judgment. He understood that his continued drug use was \ninconsistent with his employer\u2019s drug policy, inconsistent with the responsibility of holding \na security clearance, and illegal under federal law. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant admitted at the hearing that he most likely did not disclose his drug \nhistory in his 2001 SCA, nor did he disclose any of his subsequent drug use until 2010, \nwhen he was sponsored for an upgrade to a TS/SCI security clearance. Starting in 2010, \nApplicant has been forthright and open with the government regarding his history of drug \nuse, including his 2010 use of mushrooms and his 2016 use of marijuana. He credibly \ntestified that his lifestyle has changed, and he understands the importance of following \nthe rules and regulations associated with holding a security clearance. He no longer \nassociates with individuals who use drugs, and he signed a letter of intent promising never \nto use illegal drugs in the future  \n \nIt has been almost ten years since Applicant used drugs while holding a security \nclearance, and it has been over three years since he last used marijuana. Given the \npassage of time since his last criminal drug-related behavior and Applicant\u2019s credible \ntestimony regarding his future intent to abstain from any illegal drug use, it is unlikely that \nthis behavior will recur, and it does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) was established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis.  \n \nApplicant forthrightly disclosed adverse derogatory information, and he was not \nevasive during his testimony. He has met his burden of proof and persuasion. He \nmitigated the drug involvement security concerns and established his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.   \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United States to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD for SORs issued after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 3, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 5, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 21, 2019, scheduling the hearing for November 19, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf. Applicant offered five \n\n \n2 \n \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through E, and admitted into \nevidence. The record was left open until December 19, 2019, for receipt of additional \ndocumentation. On December 17, 2019, Applicant offered two additional sets of \ndocuments, with numerous attachments (attchs), which I have marked as AppXs F and \nG, and admitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on \nDecember 3, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.g., and 2a.~2.d. She \ndenied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.~1.e., and 1.h.~1.j. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old registered nurse. (TR at page 26 line 14 to page 28 \nline 15, and GX 1 at page 7.) She is married to a member of the U.S. Navy, and has \none child. (TR at page 16 line 17 to page 18 line 3.) As they are deployed in Japan, \nApplicant has had difficulties qualifying to work in her profession, which resulted in the \nalleged financial difficulties.   \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. Applicant denies that she had her husband failed to file their 2013 Federal \nincome tax returns in a timely fashion. They incorrectly thought that, as they were \ndeployed overseas, they \u201chad some kind of . . . extension.\u201d (TR at page 21 line 25 to \npage 24 line 11.) They in fact filed this return in September of 2014, five months late, as \nevidenced by this filing. (AppXs A, B, and F at attch A.) I find that Applicant made a \ngood-faith effort to comply with Federal tax law; and as such, this allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.b.  Applicant denies that she had a past-due debt to a cable provider in the \namount of about $322. Applicant avers that she was unaware of this alleged debt until \nshe was interviewed by a special agent. (TR at page 24 line 12 to page 25 line 14.) Her \ncredibility is attested to by those who know Applicant in the work place. (AppX G.) This \ndebt was \u201csettled in full\u201d in July of 2019, as evidenced by a letter from this creditor. \n(AppX D.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.c.  Applicant denies that she had a past-due debt to a department store in the \namount of about $299. Applicant avers that she lost her wallet and was unaware of this \nalleged debt until she was interviewed by a special agent. (TR at page 36 line 20 to \npage 37 line 10.) This debt \u201chas a zero balance,\u201d as evidenced by a letter from this \ncreditor. (AppX F at attch C.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. and 1.e. Applicant denies that she is delinquent on her student loans that \ntotal about $16,922. Applicant is current with her student loans, with a current balance \nof about $15,055. (TR at page 37 line 11 to page 38 line 7, at page 44 line 19 to page \n46 line 16, and AppX F at attchs D and E.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.f. Applicant denies that she had a past-due credit card debt in the amount of \nabout $8,228. (TR at page 25 line 23 to page 26 line 14.) This debt was settled and has \na \u201c$0.00\u201d balance, as evidenced by documentation from this creditor. (AppX F at attch \nF.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant denies that she is delinquent on another student loan for about \n$11,817. This loan is settled in full as evidenced by documentation regarding this \nstudent loan. (TR at page 38 lines 8 ~19, at page 41 line 21 to page 42 line 8, at page \n46 line 18 to page 47 line 17, and AppX F at attch G.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.h. and 1.i. Applicant denies that she had past-due credit card debts totaling \nabout $1,442. (TR at page 40 lines 3~14.) This debt was settled and has a \u201c$0.00\u201d \nbalance, as evidenced by documentation from this creditor. (AppX F at attchs H and I.) \nThese allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.j. Applicant denies that she had a past-due credit card debt in the amount of \nabout $715. (TR at page 38 line 8 to page 49 line 6.) This debt \u201chas a zero balance,\u201d as \nevidenced by a letter from this creditor. (AppX F at attch J.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n2.a. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a dual national of the Philippines and the United \nStates, and resides in the Philippines. His is retired and has no connection with the \nPhilippine government. (TR at page 49 lines 6~21.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \n \n2.b. Applicant\u2019s two older brothers are citizens and residents of the Philippines. \nOne \u201cdrives a jeep,\u201d and the other \u201cowns a Gown Shop.\u201d (TR at page 13 lines 4~10, and \nat page 14 lines 10~20.) She has little contact with these brothers, once in 12 year. (TR \nat page 15 line 16 to page 16 line 5.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n2.c. Applicant\u2019s aunt is a citizen and resident of the  Philippines. She also owns \n\u201ca Gown Shop.\u201d (TR at page 15 lines 8~15, and at page 16 lines 6~16.) Applicant\u2019s \ncontact with her aunt is infrequent, at best. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n2.d. Applicant and her husband own \u201cundeveloped\u201d property in the Philippines \nworth about $60,000. They are unsure what they will do with this property, which has \nappreciated little since its purchase.  As their son may return to the United States to \nfurther his education once he reaches college age, they may sell this property and also \nreturn to the United States. (TR at page 18 line 4 to page 21 line 9, at page 30 line 23 to \npage 32 line 20, and at page 50 lines 20~25.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: The Philippines is a multi-party, \nconstitutional republic with a bicameral legislature. There is considerable risk of \nterrorism in Manila. There are also human rights issues including unlawful or arbitrary \nkillings by security forces, vigilantes, and other groups allegedly connected to the \ngovernment.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant allegedly had substantial past-due debts, and failed to file 2013 tax \nreturns in a timely fashion. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has successfully addressed all of the alleged past-due indebtedness. \nShe is current with her tax filings, and her one-time late tax filing occurred more than \nfive years ago. She has demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. Financial Considerations is found for \nApplicant. \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest  \n \n  \nApplicant has Philippine relatives, and co-owns undeveloped property worth \nabout $60,000. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant has infrequent contact with his Philippine relatives, none of whom has \nany connection with the Philippine government. Her property interest in the Philippines \nis also diminumous, at best. Foreign Influence is found for Applicant.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace. She performs well at her job. (AppX G.)  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations and Foreign Influence \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.j.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.~2.d.: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. National security eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor since June 2015. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 1984 to August 1988 and in the U.S. Coast Guard from June 1991 to June 2007, when he retired. (Tr. 58-59.) He was employed by various federal contractors before being hired for his current position. He had periods of unemployment from January to March 2012 and May to June 2015. He received a security clearance in 2003. In his security clearance application, he disclosed that his application to continue his clearance was denied by another federal agency in February 2016 based on financial considerations. (GX 1 at 55-56.) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 1989 and a master\u2019s degree in May 2003. He married in September 1994 and has two children ages 21 and 18. The SOR alleges a delinquent home-mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); three delinquent credit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d); a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that was dismissed (SOR \u00b6 1.e); failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns 3 for tax years 2011 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a federal tax debt of $90,000 for tax years 2011-2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and a state tax debt of $12,000 for tax years 2011-2016.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 8, 2018. On April \n4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 7, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. His answer was returned by the DOD CAF for notarization on \nAugust 1, 2019, and he returned the notarized documents on August 18, 2019. \n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on September 18, 2019, and the case was \nassigned to me on October 15, 2019. On October 24, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nNovember 14, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he had attached several federal and state \nincome tax returns to his answer to the SOR. His answer to the SOR reflected four \nenclosures: (1) federal income tax returns for 2011-2016; (2) state income tax returns \nfor 2011-2016; (3) a summary of federal taxes due; and (4) a letter from the IRS \napproving a payment plan. None of these enclosures were attached to his answer when \nthe hearing commenced. At the hearing, he resubmitted the summary of federal taxes \ndue and the IRS letter approving his payment plan. (AX A; AX B at 2-3.) \n \nI kept the record open until December 9, 2019, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence, including reconstructing the documentation he had \nattached to his answer. He timely submitted AX E through L, which were admitted \nwithout objection. AX E consisted of federal income tax returns for 2011-2017 and state \nincome tax returns for 2011-2015. In his post-hearing submission, he stated that the \nstate did not receive returns for 2016-2018, but that his state taxes were computed \nbased on his federal returns. (AX L.) DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 2, \n2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f \nand he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h. His admissions in his answer and \nat the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor since \nJune 2015. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 1984 to \nAugust 1988 and in the U.S. Coast Guard from June 1991 to June 2007, when he \nretired. (Tr. 58-59.) He was employed by various federal contractors before being hired \nfor his current position. He had periods of unemployment from January to March 2012 \nand May to June 2015. He received a security clearance in 2003. In his security \nclearance application, he disclosed that his application to continue his clearance was \ndenied by another federal agency in February 2016 based on financial considerations. \n(GX 1 at 55-56.) \n \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 1989 and a master\u2019s degree in \nMay 2003. He married in September 1994 and has two children ages 21 and 18. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a delinquent home-mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); three \ndelinquent credit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d); a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that \nwas dismissed (SOR \u00b6 1.e); failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns \n\n \n3 \n \nfor tax years 2011 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a federal tax debt of $90,000 for tax years \n2011-2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and a state tax debt of $12,000 for tax years 2011-2016. The \nevidence concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: delinquent home-mortgage loan for $572,585, foreclosed in \n2018. Applicant purchased this home in December 2011 for $525,000 at a foreclosure \nsale, and financed the entire purchase with a loan guaranteed by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA). (GX 3 at 3.) When he purchased this home, his adjusted gross \nincome was about $162,593, and his wife was not employed outside the home. (AX E at \n1; Tr. 31.) He knew the house \u201cwasn\u2019t in the best of shape.\u201d (Tr. 29.) After moving into \nthe house, he discovered major structural problems. He used credit cards in an effort to \nfinance the repairs. He was laid off in January 2012 and unemployed until March 2012. \nHis annual income was about $110,000 when he returned to work, and later reduced to \n$90,000 when his company\u2019s contract with a U.S. Government agency was protested \nand delayed for about a year. (Tr. 30, 35.) He testified that the loan was modified at \nleast twice, but he still was unable to catch up on the payments. (Tr. 32.) He listed the \nproperty for sale in February 2018 and quickly received an offer, but the contract was \nnever consummated because the prospective buyer\u2019s home inspector determined that \nthe home required more than $100,000 in structural repairs. (GX 2 at 4; Tr. 37-37.) \nApplicant has made no further payments on the mortgage loan, and the house remains \nin a foreclosure status.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent credit-card account charged off for $15,066. At some \ntime before October 26, 2019, Applicant made a payment arrangement for this debt, but \nthe collection agency was unable to process the scheduled $100 payments by \nautomatic debit for reasons not reflected in the record. Applicant testified that he made \none payment by telephone. (Tr. 117.) The collection agency\u2019s records reflected a \nbalance of $14,976, indicating that about $90 had been paid. (AX C.) Applicant testified \nthat he had no reason for not making further payments, except that he was \noverwhelmed with his financial situation. (Tr. 119.) The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: delinquent unsecured loan charged off for $3,554. Applicant \ntestified that he did not know why he stopped making payments on this debt. (Tr. 121.) \nIt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: line of credit charged off for $7,846. This debt was due to \noverdrafts on Applicant\u2019s bank account. He has not taken any steps to resolve it. (Tr. \n123-24.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition filed in March 2017 and \ndismissed on January 9, 2018. Applicant completed the required financial counseling \nand made several payments to the bankruptcy trustee before the petition was dismissed \non motion of the IRS, apparently because of Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. (GX 5 at 8-9; Tr. 124-26.)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2011-2016. Applicant attributed his failure to timely file his tax returns to \nprocrastination. He did not request extensions of time to file. He erroneously believed \nthat he did not owe any taxes and that his failures to timely file were \u201cno big deal.\u201d He \ndid not file his tax returns until his bankruptcy attorney told him that he needed to file all \nhis returns before filing the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 97.) His federal income tax returns \nfor 2011-2015 were all signed on September 29, 2016, and his 2016 federal return was \nsigned on March 30, 2017. His state income tax returns for 2011-2015 were all signed \non March 29, 2017. (AX E.) He did not file state income tax returns for 2016-2018, but \nthe state tax authority informed him that it had generated substitute returns and \ncomputed his state taxes based on his federal returns. (AX L.) He did not submit \ndocumentary proof that the returns in AX E were filed and received by the appropriate \ntax authorities, but he did submit copy of an email exchange with his bankruptcy \nattorney on December 20, 2016, in which he indicated that he had a certified mail \nreceipt showing that the returns had been mailed. (AX K.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: delinquent federal income tax debt for $90,000 for tax years \n2011-2016. In March 2019, Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the IRS \nproviding for monthly payments of $661, to be paid by automatic withdrawal from his \nbank account. (AX A.) He submitted evidence that the required payments were made in \nAugust, September, October, and November 2019. (AX B at 1; AX I.) He also submitted \nevidence reflecting that his total debt for federal income taxes was $37,158, broken \ndown as follows: $8,846 for 2011; $6,496 for 2012; $12,044 for 2013; $3,490 for 2015; \nand $6,282 for 2018. (AX B at 2-3.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: delinquent state income tax debt of $12,000 for tax years 2011-\n2016. In Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, he stated that he was paying the \nstate $1,000 per month. (GX 1 at 50-51.) However, he has not provided any \ndocumentation of payments. In December 2019, he made a payment agreement with \nthe state tax authority to resolve a balance of $4,176 in 24 monthly installments, with \nthe first payment due in January 2020, after the record closed. (AX J; AX L at 2.) \n \n \nIn October 2019, Applicant and his wife moved into a modest apartment for \nwhich they are paying rent of $1,652. (AX D.) His wife has returned to the workforce and \nearns about $2,000 per month. (Tr. 137.) He estimates that they now have about $1,500 \nto $2,000 per month in disposable income that can be used for debt repayment. (Tr. \n144.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n5 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence reflecting his delinquent \ndebts and failures to timely file federal and state income taxes and pay the taxes due \nare sufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n7 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the delinquent mortgage loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant purchased a house that he knew was not in good shape, but the latent \nstructural problems in the house were conditions beyond his control. His loss of \nemployment for three months shortly after purchasing the house, followed by two \nsignificant reductions in annual income, were conditions largely beyond his control. He \nacted responsibly by staying in contact with the lender and the VA. He negotiated at \nleast two loan modifications, filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, and attempted to \nsell the home, without success. However, he has not acted responsibly regarding the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, for the reasons set out in the \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6 20(d), below. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant completed the counseling required by \nthe bankruptcy court, but his financial problems are not under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, \non which he has not established payment plans or made any recent payments. \nAlthough he has contacted the creditors and promised to pay them after he pays his \nfederal tax debts, a promise to pay a delinquent debt in the future is not a substitute for \na track record of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. \nBd. Sep. 19, 2008). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make \npayments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, \nor establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish \na plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has little \nchoice about paying his tax debts first to avoid involuntary collection. Although he has \npromised his other creditors that they will be paid eventually, his promises fall short of a \ntangible and credible financial plan to resolve his non-tax debts. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the federal tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, for which \nApplicant has established a payment plan and is current on the required payments. It is \nnot established for the state tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Applicant claimed in his \nsecurity clearance application that he was paying the state $1,000 per month, but he \nprovided no documentary evidence to support his claim. Although he recently \nestablished a payment plan for the state tax debt, he submitted no evidence of any \npayments under the plan.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for past-due federal tax returns, which have been filed, \nand the federal tax debt, on which Applicant is making regular payments pursuant to a \npayment agreement. It is partially established for the past-due state tax returns, which \nhave been filed for 2011 to 2015. The 2016 state return was not filed, but the state tax \nauthority apparently generated a substitute return and computed his state taxes based \non his federal return. It is not established for the state tax debt, because Applicant had \nnot begun making any payments in compliance with his payment plan as of the date the \nrecord closed. However, Applicant\u2019s eventual compliance with his some of his tax \nobligations does not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-\nenforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed his past-due federal and state returns \n\u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. \nBd. Oct. 30, 2014). His long-term procrastination regarding his federal and state income \ntaxes returns indicates that he lacks the good judgment and reliability required of \npersons who are granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-04159 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2016). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts and failures to timely file his federal \nand state income tax returns and pay the taxes due. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations):  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR lists five allegations under the financial considerations guideline. SOR 1.a alleges a line of credit ($9,444) for Applicant\u2019s rental property. The account has been delinquent since June 2014. SOR 1.b is for the foreclosed property associated with the line of credit in SOR 1.a. SOR 1.c is for child support in the amount of $19,334 that has been delinquent since April 2016. SOR 1.d is a delinquent credit card account that became delinquent in August 2014. SOR 1.e is a judgment for $3,632 filed by a homeowner\u2019s association against Applicant in November 2016. Applicant admitted SOR 1.b, the foreclosure allegation. He denied the four debt allegations because he paid the three debts and returned the child support account to a current status. (Applicant\u2019s April 2019 answer to the SOR; AE A) Applicant is 48 years old and has been married since July 2015. His wife is currently living in another country. He has two children from his previous marriage that ended in divorce in March 2014. He earned a degree in automotive technology in 1992. Since September 2018, Applicant has been employed as a field service engineer for a defense contractor. He installs security screening devices at airports. He held the same job with another contractor from August 2017 to June 2018. He was unemployed during at least the first eight months of 2017. Applicant received a security clearance in 2010, but the clearance was discontinued in 2014 because of marital problems. (GE 1 at 2",

Eligibility for security clearance access \nis granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 1, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On January 5, 2017, he completed a subject interview (PSI) \nwith an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). After reviewing \nthe results of a security background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) \ncould not make the affirmative findings required to grant a security clearance, and \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated April 5, 2019.

The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on April 12, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 19, 2019, for a \nhearing on August 27, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s \nfour exhibits (GE) 1-4 and Applicant\u2019s eight exhibits (AE) A-H were entered into \nevidence without objection. The record in this case closed on September 4, 2019, when \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR lists five allegations under the financial considerations guideline. SOR \n1.a alleges a line of credit ($9,444) for Applicant\u2019s rental property. The account has \nbeen delinquent since June 2014. SOR 1.b is for the foreclosed property associated \nwith the line of credit in SOR 1.a. SOR 1.c is for child support in the amount of $19,334 \nthat has been delinquent since April 2016. SOR 1.d is a delinquent credit card account \nthat became delinquent in August 2014. SOR 1.e is a judgment for $3,632 filed by a \nhomeowner\u2019s association against Applicant in November 2016. Applicant admitted SOR \n1.b, the foreclosure allegation. He denied the four debt allegations because he paid the \nthree debts and returned the child support account to a current status. (Applicant\u2019s April \n2019 answer to the SOR; AE A) \nApplicant is 48 years old and has been married since July 2015. His wife is \ncurrently living in another country. He has two children from his previous marriage that \nended in divorce in March 2014. He earned a degree in automotive technology in 1992. \nSince September 2018, Applicant has been employed as a field service engineer for a \ndefense contractor. He installs security screening devices at airports. He held the same \njob with another contractor from August 2017 to June 2018. He was unemployed during \nat least the first eight months of 2017. Applicant received a security clearance in 2010, \nbut the clearance was discontinued in 2014 because of marital problems. (GE 1 at 26-\n27, 32-35, 52; AE F; Tr. 8-11) \nAll allegations in the SOR are related to the rapid deterioration of Applicant\u2019s \nsecond marriage beginning in February 2013 to his second wife, and leading to divorce \nin March 2014. From January 2011 to February 2013, Applicant was working in \ntelecommunications for a defense contractor in the Middle East. He returned to the US \nin February 2013, because of marital problems. Following a couple of marital incidents \nbetween Applicant and his second wife, she filed for divorce. The divorce became final \nin March 2014. As a result of the divorce Applicant lost his overseas contractor job and \nhis security clearance.

He was \nworking part time as a taxi driver and other \u201cside jobs,\u201d including in a transportation \nservice. His next full-time job was in August 2017. (GE 2 at 7; AE F; Tr. 33-36) \nSOR 1.a \u2013 This account is an equity line of credit Applicant opened in 2008. His \ndocumentation shows he settled the account on February 13, 2019, after making \nmonthly payments on the account in the preceding eight months. (GE 3 at 1; Tr. 31-34; \nAE B) \nSOR 1.b \u2013 The property associated with the SOR 1.a account was foreclosed in \n2014. The reason for foreclosure was that Applicant could not sell or rent the house \nduring pendency of the divorce proceedings. He attempted a home loan modification \n(HLM), but did not have $20,000 to restructure the mortgage. In addition, he was either \nunemployed or underemployed. He was more concerned about addressing his child \nsupport than attempting to save the property from foreclosure. (Tr. 34-37) \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This delinquent account ($19,344) represents child support arrears. \nApplicant missed a substantial number of monthly payments in 2016 and 2017. He \nbegan paying $413 a week in October 2018 to eliminate the arrearage portion of \nsupport. He made two extra payments of $500 in the same month. Between March and \nJune 2019, Applicant made extra arrears payments totaling approximately $15,134, \neliminating his support arrears altogether. He restored his child support to a current \nstatus, continuing to pay $1,291 monthly in support. He partially funded these payments \nwith an overseas job bonus of $10,000 in October 2018. The other funding source was \nhis job earnings during the period as he was working 80 hours a week for his employer. \n(Tr. 38-43; AE A; AE C at 1-8) \nSOR 1.d \u2013 This account is a credit card. Applicant\u2019s documentation shows that \nhe paid this delinquent debt in May 2018. He used his overtime to pay the account. He \nhad used the card to pay child support and legal fees related to his March 2014 divorce. \n(Tr. 45; AE D) \nSOR 1.e \u2013 This account represents a delinquent homeowner\u2019s association \njudgment that was filed against Applicant in November 2014. Applicant reported this \njudgment in his November 2016 e-QIP and his January 2017 PSI. The homeowner\u2019s \nassociation manager notified Applicant by letter in October 2018 that his debt was \nsettled for $430. (GE 1 at 55; GE 2 at 15; Tr. 45-46; AE A; AE E) \nApplicant earns approximately $4,800 a month. After subtracting his child support \nand car rental payments, his net monthly income is $1,900, which he deposits in his \nchecking account. He has approximately $140 in his savings account and $5,000 in his \nchecking account. His retirement account contains $12,000. He has never had financial \ncounseling and has no budget. His child support and his mortgage are automatically \ndeducted from his checking account.

She has known him for 27 \nyears and met him when she was 10 years old. Applicant has become a close friend of \nReference A\u2019s family. Applicant provided emotional support to Reference A when her \ngrandfather died and when her mother was hospitalized for several days two years ago. \nReference A recalled that Applicant\u2019s March 2014 divorce had a detrimental impact on \nhim, but he recovered and merits a security clearance based on his trustworthiness. (Tr. \n65-68); AE G) \nReference B is Applicant\u2019s aunt. She considers him a strong family man who \nreturned home in 2013 to deal with emergency family problems and lost his security \nclearance and his overseas job as a result. His home went into foreclosure and he \ndescended into deep debt. He has since pulled himself out of his debt and enjoys his \nwork as a field service engineer. (AE G) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAn applicant who seeks a security clearance with the Government must \ndemonstrate that he has good judgment and is trustworthy. A gauge of his judgment \nand trustworthiness can be determined by an evaluation of how he manages his \npersonal affairs. An applicant with a history of financial irresponsibility may also \ndemonstrate irresponsibility in failing to comply with rules and regulations for \nsafeguarding sensitive or classified information. \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise a security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s January 2017 PSI, his April 2019 answers to the SOR, and the credit \nreports establish the Government\u2019s case under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) is inapplicable because there is no evidence \nindicating that Applicant was unwilling to pay any of the four listed debts or allow the \nproperty to slip into foreclosure. He was more concerned about doing his best to pay \nchild support although the support records show he struggled to maintain the payment \nschedule in 2016 and 2017. \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe record shows that all the allegations of the SOR are connected to Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce. The foreclosure and the four debts became delinquent by April 2016. Applicant \nincurred the debts under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. By the time the \ndivorce was finalized in March 2014, he lost his overseas employment and his security \nclearance. Then, he entered a period of unemployment or underemployment. After \nfinally resuming full-time employment in August 2017, he began to tackle his debt \ndelinquencies. He settled the SOR 1.a line-of-credit debt in February 2019, after making \nregular monthly payments for eight months. He began paying the child support \narrearage (SOR 1.c) in October 2018 eliminating the arrearage in June 2019. He settled \nthe SOR 1.e credit card debt in May 2018, and the SOR judgment in October 2018. \nThough he has never had financial counseling, there is ample documented evidence \nshowing that his indebtedness has been resolved. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nIt is clear that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by marital problems \nending in his March 2014 divorce, and his subsequent employment issues. After he \nfinally regained full-time employment in August 2017, he began clearing his delinquent \ndebt load in May 2018. By June 2019, he eliminated all debts and arrears listed in the \nSOR. Significantly, he began resolving the debts almost a year before the issuance of \nthe SOR. Financial counseling and utilizing a budget can help Applicant manage his \nfinances in a more responsible manner. Considering the evidence as a whole, including \nthe favorable character evidence from References A and B, Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1e: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 3; Item 6)  \nOn May 16, 2019, he said the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h was paid in full. (Item 2) He is credited \nwith resolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n \nIn his May 16, 2019 SOR response, Applicant said he was paying the student loans \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c through wage garnishment. (Item 2) He said he planned to \nsettle the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. (Id.)  \n \nApplicant said he was contesting the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. The debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d was invalid because the telecommunications company stopped providing \ncellular service where Applicant lived, and the telecommunications company said his plan \nwould be cancelled without penalty. (Item 2) Nevertheless, the telecommunications \ncompany billed Applicant for $3,431. (Id.) He did not explain why he contested the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e for $2,245; however, he believed it would be removed from his credit report. \n(Id.) \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel noted the absence of corroborating or \nsupporting documentation of resolution of the SOR debts. Aside from Applicant\u2019s \nuncorroborated statements, there is no documentary evidence that Applicant paid, \narranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The \nrecord lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and other mitigating \ninformation. The FORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the \nFORM \u201cin which to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, \nrebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any \nobjections or submit any additional information . . . your case will be assigned to an \nAdministrative Judge for a determination based solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this \nFORM. (FORM at 4 (emphasis in original)) He did not respond to the FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \n \n Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $112,242. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)).  \n \nApplicant said his delinquent debts resulted from the death of his father-in-law \nbecause he inherited some of his father-in-law\u2019s debts. He did not explain when his father-\nin-law died or how or why his father-in-law\u2019s debts were inherited. Most of Applicant\u2019s \ndebts resulted from student loans. His most recent credit report of record indicates his \nstudent loans are in collection. He did not explain why they became delinquent or provide \ndetails about the ongoing garnishment mentioned in his SOR response.  \n \n\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nhas since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or \nshe maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. Applicant does not receive full mitigating credit under AG 20(b) because \nhe did not establish that he maintained contact with his creditors and otherwise acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \n \nApplicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h through a wage garnishment. Payment of a \ndebt \u201cthough garnishment rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.\u201d \nCompare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. \n04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two of four debts through \ngarnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations concerns). See also ISCR \nCase No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards \ndelinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in light of other factors); ISCR Case No. \n08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding the case to the administrative judge \nand stating when addressing an Internal Revenue Service garnishment, \u201cOn its face, \nsatisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment of a creditor\u2019s garnishment is \nnot the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d). I have \ncredited Applicant with mitigation of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h because it is unclear whether \nthis was actually a garnishment as opposed to a voluntary allotment from his salary. \nApplicant loses some mitigating credit because he did not clearly establish that he \nvoluntarily repaid the debt owed to his employer.  \n \nApplicant denied responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e for $3,431 and \n$2,245; however, he did not provide documentation showing his disputes of his \nresponsibility for the two debts, such as letters to the creditors explaining why the \naccounts were disputed. The debts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(e) because he did \nnot provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or . . . evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). Applicant did not \nprove he acted in good faith. \nApplicant did not provide documentation relating to his SOR debts such as: (1) \nproof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or \na letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) \ncorrespondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; (3) copies of \ncredible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating he \ndid not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) evidence \nof attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or agreements to \nshow that he was attempting to resolve this debt; or (5) other evidence of progress or \nresolution.  \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to \nmake greater documented progress resolving the seven debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. \nThere is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being resolved and will not \nrecur in the future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old director of operations. In 2003, he graduated from \ncollege with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2005, he received a master\u2019s degree. He is well \neducated and interested in continuing his contributions to national defense. There is no \nevidence of security violations.  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nThe evidence against granting Applicant\u2019s security clearance is substantial. \nApplicant owes seven delinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling $100,242. There is no \ncorroborating documentation of progress after the SOR was issued in the resolution of \nthese seven debts. His actions raise unmitigated questions regarding Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted at this time. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. \n10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. It is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security \nclearance eligibility at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n09/08/2020 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate his long-standing history of financial problems. For 13 tax years \ncovering 2006-2018: (1) Applicant failed to timely file a tax return for 11 of the 13 tax \nyears; (2) returns have now been filed for 7 of the 13 tax years; and (3) he owes \napproximately $29,000 in back taxes for tax years 2006-2008 for which he has yet to \nmake a payment arrangement with the IRS. In addition, he has unresolved child-support \narrearages, a delinquent student loan, and six collection accounts. Accordingly, this \ncase is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non September 27, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. He was interviewed as part of a background investigation in \nNovember 2017. (Exhibit 2) He replied to written interrogatories in May 2019. (Exhibit \n\n \n2 \n \n2). Thereafter, on June 26, 2019, after reviewing the application and the information \ngathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons \n(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to \na complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline \nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 23, 2019. In a two-page memorandum, he \nadmitted the SOR allegations except for the matters in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.i, which he \ndenied. He also provided brief explanations. And he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 3, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on December 2, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-11. Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-C. Applicant and his \nspouse provided witness testimony. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nDecember 11, 2019.  \n \nThe record was kept open until January 3, 2020, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to present additional documentation. (Tr. 86-89) Those matters were timely \nreceived and they (along with the accompanying e-mails) are admitted without \nobjections as Exhibits D-O.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. (Tr. 5-6) He is employed as a senior systems engineer for a large company \nin the defense industry. He began working for this company in October 2018. (Tr. 36) \nHe referred to it as his \u201ccareer job\u201d and \u201cdream job.\u201d (Tr. 77) His gross annual salary is \nabout $100,000 ($8,346 monthly) as of December 2019. (Exhibit E) He has a reputation \nas a good employee per letters of recommendation from two co-workers. (Exhibits B \nand C) His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering physics \nand a master\u2019s degree in organizational leadership. He married in 2007 and divorced in \n2015. He married his current spouse in 2018. He has two adult children, daughters, \nages 22 and 21, born from other relationships.   \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems or difficulties. It includes \nunresolved federal income-tax matters, child-support arrearages, a delinquent student \nloan, and delinquent consumer accounts. He attributes his financial problems to \nhardship caused by irregular employment, to include periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. (Tr. 33-36) He attributes his income-tax problems to negligence. (Tr. \n33) A review of Applicant\u2019s employment history follows below and is based on \ninformation he provided in his security clearance application. (Exhibit 1)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant worked as a systems engineer for an aerospace company in State T \nfrom February 2004 to October 2010, when he was laid off due to the end of a particular \nhigh-profile program. He was then unemployed for a few months before he accepted a \njob as an analyst for a healthcare company. He worked there from January 2011 to April \n2011, when he left to pursue a master\u2019s degree in State P. He was unemployed and \ncollected unemployment compensation from April 2011 to October 2011 in State P. He \nlived with his parents and worked as a graduate assistant during the master\u2019s program \nfrom October 2011 to June 2013. He completed the necessary course work, but had yet \nto receive a degree as of September 2017. (Exhibit 1 at 12) His master\u2019s thesis was in \nrevision and being reviewed by the university, although he expected to receive the \ndegree in December 2017.  \n \nAfter departing the university, Applicant worked as a part-time retail associate for \na couple of months from June 2013 to August 2013, while still living in State P. He left \nthat job to relocate to State T to look for work. He was unemployed from August 2013 to \nJanuary 2014, when he began working as a full-time teacher for a public school district. \nHe had the teaching job until December 2015, when he returned to State P and moved \nin with his parents, as he was then undergoing difficult personal circumstances, \nincluding a divorce. He was unemployed from December 2015 to October 2016. He \nworked on his master\u2019s thesis during this time. In about October 2016, he returned to \nState T for a job as a part-time substitute teacher for a staffing company. He had that \njob in State T until he began his current employment in the defense industry in October \n2018, which is located in State A.  \n \na. Federal Income-Tax Matters \n \nIn four separate allegations, the SOR concerns two federal tax liens, filed in June \n2011 and September 2011, in the amounts of $22,783 and $22,806, respectively; failure \nto timely file, as required, federal income tax returns for tax years 2008-2017; and \n$14,536 in back taxes owed to the IRS for tax year 2008. Applicant admitted the four \nSOR allegations in his written answer. His history of tax problems is long-standing, \ngoing back to at least tax year 2006, as shown by the documentary evidence. It also \nappears the back taxes for 2008 are included in one or both of the federal tax liens, and \nso the allegation will be decided for Applicant on the basis of the same conduct being \nalleged twice. \n \nTo address the federal income-tax matters, Applicant initially hired an accountant \nto prepare returns and then retained the services of a tax-relief company in April 2019. \n(Exhibit A) As Applicant explained, he paid an initial investigation fee of $495 and pays \nthe company a month fee of $864, and the matter was pending or under review with the \ncompany. (Tr. 38-40) A review of available IRS records\u2014which does not include copies \nof the tax liens\u2014and credit reports follows below.  \n \nThe June 2011 federal tax lien for $22,783 is not reflected in the October 2017 \ncredit report. (Exhibit 8) It is reflected in Applicant\u2019s IRS Account Transcripts for tax \nyears 2006-2008, although the dollar amount is not reflected. (Exhibits F, G, and H). \n\n \n4 \n \nThe lien is not reflected in the more recent credit reports from 2018 and 2019. (Exhibits \n9, 10, and 11)   \n \nThe September 2011 federal tax lien for $22,806 is reflected in the October 2017 \ncredit report. (Exhibit 8) It is not reflected in the credit reports from 2018 and 2019. \n(Exhibits 8-11) The lien is reflected in the IRS Account Transcripts for tax years 2006-\n2008, although the dollar amount is not reflected. (Exhibits F, G, and H)  \n \nBecause copies of the tax liens are not in evidence, it is unknown which tax \nyears the liens apply. It is certainly possible the two federal tax liens are for the same \ntax years, the second lien filed to reflect an increase in the amount of back taxes owed.  \n \nConcerning the failure to file and back taxes, a review of IRS documentation for \n13 tax years covering 2006-2018 shows the following: (1) Applicant failed to timely file a \ntax return for 11 of the 13 tax years; (2) returns have now been filed for 7 of the 13 tax \nyears; and (3) he owes approximately $29,000 in back taxes for tax years 2006-2008 for \nwhich he has yet to make a payment arrangement with the IRS. Details are discussed \nbelow. In making the findings below, I have relied on the IRS Account Transcripts \nbecause, in my view, they are the best evidence of a taxpayer\u2019s status with the IRS.  \n \nFor tax year 2006, the IRS Account Transcript, dated May 30, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $2,436, which includes $1,081 in accrued interest and $54 in \naccrued penalty. (Exhibit F) The transcript also reflects that an extension of time to file a \ntax return on October 15, 2007, was made on April 15, 2007; inquiry and notice for non-\nfiling were issued in 2008; a substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS in April 2010; \na tax return was secured in November 2010; and a collection notice was issued in 2011 \nbefore the filing of the first tax lien.  \n \nFor tax year 2007, the IRS Account Transcript, dated May 30, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $12,412, which includes $3,182 in accrued interest and $499 in \naccrued penalty. (Exhibit G). The transcript also reflects that an extension of time to file \na tax return on October 15, 2008, was made on April 15, 2008; inquiry and notice for \nnon-filing were issued in 2009; a substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS in April \n2010; a tax return was secured in November 2010; and a collection notice was issued in \n2011 before the filing of the first tax lien. \n \nFor tax year 2008, the IRS Account Transcript, dated May 30, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $14,521, which includes $3,530 in accrued interest and $895 in \naccrued penalty. (Exhibit H) The transcript also reflects that an extension of time to file a \ntax return on October 15, 2009, was made on April 15, 2009; inquiry and notice for non-\nfiling were issued in 2010; a substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS in July 2010; \na tax return was secured in March 2011; and a collection notice was issued in 2011 \nbefore the filing of the first tax lien.  \n \nFor tax year 2009, an IRS Account Transcript is not available.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nFor tax year 2010, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that no tax return was \nfiled; inquiry and notice for non-filing were issued in 2011; and a tax return was secured \nin June 2019.  \n \nFor tax year 2011, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that no tax return was \nfiled. \n \nFor tax year 2012, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an \naccount of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that no tax return was filed and that \nthe IRS issued a letter to Applicant\u2019s then employer to limit withholding allowance. \n \nFor tax year 2013, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that no tax return was \nfiled.  \n \nFor tax year 2014, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that no tax return was \nfiled; inquiry and notice for non-filing were issued in 2016 and 2017; and a tax return \nwas secured in June 2019.  \n \nFor tax year 2015, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that no tax return was \nfiled, although an extension of time to file the return on October 15, 2016, was made on \nApril 15, 2016.  \n \nFor tax year 2016, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that a tax return was filed \non June 10, 2019. \n \nFor tax year 2017, the IRS Account Transcript, dated June 14, 2019, reflects an \naccount balance of $0. (Exhibit 6) The transcript also reflects that no tax return was \nfiled. \n \nFor tax year 2018, the most recent tax year, the IRS Record of Account, dated \nMay 30, 2019, reflects Applicant timely filed his federal income return on March 25, \n2019. (Exhibit O) A credit of $1,340 was transferred and applied to tax year 2003. A \ncredit of $1,715 was transferred and applied to tax year 2006.  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant claimed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2008-\n2017 were filed by the tax-relief company. (Tr. 45-49) I informed him I could not accept \nhis representation without documentation, ideally from the IRS, given that the available \ndocumentation from the IRS (e.g., Exhibit 6) indicated he had not filed for multiple \nyears. The record was left open for Applicant to provide such documentation.   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nb. State Tax Lien for $3,291 \n \nThe SOR concerns a debt owed to State P based on a tax lien filed in February \n2006 for $3,291. The state tax lien is reflected in a credit report from November 2007. \n(Exhibit 7) It is not reflected in more recent credit reports from 2017, 2018, and 2019. \n(Exhibits 8-11) As a result, it was not discussed during his 2017 background \ninvestigation. (Exhibit 2) Applicant denied this debt in his answer to the SOR, explaining \nthat he thinks it stems from a job layoff in 1999 when he received unemployment \ncompensation and the state wanted to recoup an overpayment. Applicant had no \ndocumentation on the matter.  \n \nc. Child-Support Arrearages  \n \nThe SOR concerns a single allegation that Applicant is indebted for past-due \nchild-support payments to a state child-support office in the amount of $25,529. \nApplicant admitted the allegation in his answer to the SOR, explaining it related to one \nof his daughters who was born to a mother who was receiving public assistance. He \nexplained that he owes arrears for child support for both daughters.  \n \nA past-due account for child support for $5,445 is reflected in a 2007 credit \nreport. (Exhibit 7) Two past-due accounts for child support for $19,968 and $11,691 are \nreflected in the 2017 credit report. (Exhibit 8) A past-due account for child support for \n$25,529 is reflected in the 2018 credit report. (Exhibit 9) Two accounts for child support, \none past due for $21,625 and the other current, are reflected in the August 2019 credit \nreport. (Exhibit 10) The current account has a balance of $4,131. Three accounts for \nchild support, two past due and the other current, are reflected in the credit report from \nNovember 2019. (Exhibit 11) The two past-due accounts are for $21,615 and $21,625. \nThe current account has a balance of $2,839.  \n \nThe creditors are still trying to collect the child-support arrears. Once Applicant \nstarted working for his current employer, the creditors notified his employer to withhold \nmoney for child-support payments pursuant to wage garnishments. (Exhibit 3) Applicant \nhad no documentation on the child-support arrearages, and the matters are considered \nunresolved.  \n \nd. Delinquent Student Loan Account \n \nThe SOR concerns a delinquent student loan account with a past-due balance of \n$5,071 with a balance of $27,628. Applicant explained the student loan was for his \nundergraduate degree, which he completed in 1998, and he fell behind on payments \ndue to his irregular employment. The past-due loan is reflected as stated in the SOR in \nthe October 2017 credit report. (Exhibit 8) It is not reflected in the 2018 credit report. \n(Exhibit 9) It is reflected in the credit reports from 2019 with a $0 account balance, but it \nalso shows that the account was transferred/sold. (Exhibits 10 and 11) \n \nThe creditor is still trying to collect the past-due student loan. Once Applicant \nstarted working for his current employer, the creditor notified his employer that he was \n\n \n7 \n \nsubject to wage garnishment due to a student loan in the amount of 15% monthly to \nsatisfy a $57,606 debt. (Exhibit 3) Applicant had no documentation on the student loan, \nand the matter is considered unresolved.  \n \ne. Collection Accounts  \n \nThe SOR also concerns six collection accounts in amounts ranging from $203 to \n$2,712 for a total of $6,528. The debts stem from an apartment lease, consumer \naccounts, and medical collection accounts. Applicant had no documentation for any of \nthe six collection accounts, and the matters are considered unresolved. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n\n \n8 \n \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n                                                          \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here.  \n \nApplicant has made very little progress in resolving his extensive list of financial \nproblems. He has taken the first step or two toward addressing his long-standing federal \nincome-tax matters, but retention of the tax-relief company has yet to yield any fruit. \nTime will tell on that front. The other matters are unresolved. Nevertheless, I am no \nlonger concerned about the state tax lien for $3,291. Given that the lien dates back to \n2006, and that it no longer appears in current credit reports, it is probable that the lien \nexpired or self-released and is no longer on the books. It is mitigated by the passage of \ntime and its non-appearance in recent credit reports.  \n \n \nIn addition, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns and pay tax \nwhen due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the federal \ngovernment. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax when \ndue, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 15, 2017).  \n \n \nHere, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s federal income-tax \nproblems and the timing of his remedial action. Both are questions of fact that must be \naddressed. His tax problems date back to 2006 and continued through 2017, a period of \nmore than ten years. His remedial actions date to 2019, when he retained an \naccountant and then the tax-relief firm to assist him. It\u2019s possible that the only reason \nApplicant is addressing his tax problems is that the matters were brought to the forefront \nduring the security clearance process. He admits he was negligent concerning his \nfederal income-tax obligations, and that is mildly expressed. His negligent disregard of \nhis federal income-tax obligations demonstrates unreliability, untrustworthiness, and \nlack of good judgment. It is a disqualifying characteristic for those who seek eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nIn mitigation, Applicant disclosed his federal income-tax problems in his security \nclearance application. He also provided additional information during the security \nclearance \nprocess. \nI \nalso \nconsidered \nhis \nperiods \nof \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment during 2010-2019, the multiple relocations, and the divorce in 2015. \nThose life events often create difficult and challenging circumstances. Concerning his \nemployment history, I note that he went many years between good-paying jobs, from \nthe layoff in October 2010 until he began his current job in October 2018. Obviously, \nthose circumstances hindered his ability to repay past-due accounts. But I also note that \nApplicant\u2019s back taxes were incurred for tax years 2006-2008 before the job layoff in \n2010. In other words, this is a long-standing problem for Applicant.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant is now in the beginning stages of addressing the tax matters while the \nother matters remain unresolved. In that respect, he has not acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He owes a sizeable sum in back taxes to the IRS, at least $29,000 \nfor tax years 2006-2008 per IRS Account Transcripts; he owes more than $50,000 on a \ndelinquent student loan; and he owes at least $20,000 (if not more than $40,000) in \nchild-support arrears. That level of indebtedness suggests he is financially \noverextended now and for the foreseeable future. Considering the totality of facts and \ncircumstances, Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence of reform and \nrehabilitation. Accordingly, none of the mitigating conditions noted above apply in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f -- 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 43-year old married man with two children, ages 14 and 9. He was born and raised in what was then the Soviet Union, earning an undergraduate and master\u2019s degree in engineering from Russian universities. (Tr. 35) He immigrated to the United States in 2000 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. (Tr. 27) Applicant has been working as an engineer for a defense contractor since 2013. (Tr. 35) He is currently working towards another master\u2019s degree. (Answer at 2) Applicant met his wife in 1993 during his freshman year in college, and began dating shortly thereafter.

Clearance is granted. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nOn September 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 8, 2017. The SOR informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOD adjudicators \ncould not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the interests of \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. It recommended \nthat his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether his \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn October 8, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting subparagraphs 1.b \nthrough 1.e, and denying subparagraph 1.a, and subparagraph 1.f through 1.h. He \nrequested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on January 17, 2020. On \nFebruary 6, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice \nof hearing, scheduling the case for February 20, 2020. Applicant waived his right to 15-\ndays notice of hearing. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the Government\u2019s \nrequest, I took administrative notice of the facts set forth in an exhibit submitted by \nGovernment, and marked it as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, Attachment (Att.) 1 through Att. \n21. Applicant and three character witnesses testified. The transcript was received on \nFebruary 28, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year old married man with two children, ages 14 and 9. He was \nborn and raised in what was then the Soviet Union, earning an undergraduate and \nmaster\u2019s degree in engineering from Russian universities. (Tr. 35) He immigrated to the \nUnited States in 2000 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. (Tr. 27) Applicant \nhas been working as an engineer for a defense contractor since 2013. (Tr. 35) He is \ncurrently working towards another master\u2019s degree. (Answer at 2)  \n \n \nApplicant met his wife in 1993 during his freshman year in college, and began \ndating shortly thereafter. (AE L) In 1995, his wife immigrated to the United States to live \nwith her father, who had earlier immigrated to the United States in 1989. By the time \nApplicant\u2019s wife had moved to the United States, she and Applicant had planned on \ngetting married and for Applicant to relocate here as soon as he finished his studies. \n(AE L at 2)  \n \n \nIn June 2000, Applicant\u2019s wife graduated from a U.S. college. In July 2000, she \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen. In August 2000 Applicant and his wife married, and \nin November 2000, Applicant relocated to the United States. (AE L at 3)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s children were both born in the United States. (AE L at 5) Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter, the older of his two children, has dual Russian and U.S. citizenship. Applicant \nobtained dual citizenship status for her during a trip to visit his parents when she was a \ntoddler. (Tr. 33)  Both Applicant and his wife were dual Russian citizens at the time. \nWhen they applied for a travel visa for their daughter, the Russian government informed \nthem that she needed to travel with a Russian passport. (Tr. 32; Answer at 5) \nApplicant\u2019s daughter has no cultural affinity with Russia.                                                                          \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father died in 2019. His mother is a citizen and resident of Russia. \nShe is a retired electrical engineer. (Tr. 45) She has never worked for, or otherwise \nbeen involved, with the Russian government. (Tr. 45) The United States granted \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant\u2019s mother permanent resident alien status in 2010. (Tr. 70) From 2010 to 2015, \nApplicant\u2019s parents would typically spend the summers and the winter holidays living \nwith Applicant and his family. (Tr. 42, 64) Applicant\u2019s parents stopped traveling to the \nUnited States in 2015 after their health worsened. (Tr. 79) \n \n \nCurrently, Applicant talks with his mother approximately once per week. (Tr. 70) \nHe communicates with her more frequently since his father died, and as her health has \nworsened. Applicant provides no financial assistance to his mother. She receives a \npension of $1,000 per month. (Tr. 68) \n \n \nAlthough Applicant and his half-brother do not share the same father, they were \nraised in the same home. (Tr. 71) Applicant\u2019s half-brother is a citizen and resident of \nRussia. Applicant did not know his half-brother that well growing up because he left \nhome at 18 when Applicant was 12 years old.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s half-brother is the owner of a large company that provides private \nsecurity services to malls, department stores, and office buildings. (Tr. 50) He has no \nsecurity contracts with the Russian government or any of its municipalities. (Tr. 79) \n \n \nIn the late 2000\u2019s, Applicant\u2019s half-brother considered relocating to the United \nStates. He purchased a house in a community close to where Applicant lived. (Tr. 72-\n73) In 2008, the United States issued Applicant\u2019s half-brother an investment visa. This \nenabled him to go into business with Applicant. (Tr. 73) Together they purchased two \ngas stations between 2009 and 2011. (Tr. 78) When they initiated this venture, \nApplicant\u2019s entire family in Russia wanted to immigrate to the United States. (Tr. 75) \nThe goal was to cultivate a successful business that could provide gainful income to \nboth Appellant and everyone who relocated.  \n \n \nUltimately, Applicant\u2019s half-brother chose not to immigrate here because of a \nlengthy delay in the green card approval process for potential immigrants who were not \nimmediate family members of the sponsoring U.S. citizen. (Tr. 78) In addition, \nApplicant\u2019s parents decided that they did not want to relocate here full time. (Tr. 75)  \n \nApplicant was unable to manage the gas stations by himself. Consequently, he \nand his half-brother closed them in 2012. During the time Applicant and his half-brother \nowned the gas stations, his half-brother wired him hundreds of thousands of dollars to \ninvest in their business. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his half-brother has been \u201cslowly deteriorating as time \ngoes by.\u201d (Tr. 58) His half-brother last visited him in 2017, and Applicant last saw him in \n2019 when he returned to Russia to attend his father\u2019s funeral. (Tr. 79) Applicant \ncommunicates with his half-brother primarily through text messages on birthdays and \nholidays, discussing innocuous subjects such as their family and kids, and their travel \nexperiences. (Answer at 7; Tr. 58) They actually speak on the phone two or three times \nper year. (Tr. 50) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law, married to his half-brother, is a citizen and resident of \nRussia. Currently, she is a homemaker. Before she met his brother, she worked as a \npharmacist. Applicant last saw her when he traveled to Russia to attend his father\u2019s \nfuneral. They communicate by text approximately twice per year to exchange \npleasantries on birthdays and holidays. (Tr. 85) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is Jewish. He was granted political asylum to immigrate \nbased upon religious persecution, from what was then the Soviet Union, to the United \nStates in 1990. (Answer at 4) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law joined her husband in the \nUnited States a few years after he arrived. She has been a naturalized U.S. citizen \nsince 2018. (Answer at 3) Before immigrating, she worked in Russia at a department \nstore. \n \n \nApplicant has several acquaintances who live in Russia. He communicates with \nthem infrequently. All of his close friends live in the United States. \n \n \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. A retired lieutenant colonel whose 35-\nyear career has been spent either serving in the Army or working in the defense field \ntestified. He initially worked as Applicant\u2019s colleague, then became Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor, and is now a colleague again after Applicant was promoted into the senior \ndirector echelon of their company. (Tr. 101) Per this witness, Applicant is a dependable \nand extremely competent worker who \u201cwithout question . . . puts our nation above \neverything else.\u201d Tr. 104-105) Moreover, this witness testified that he has \u201cbeen in the \ndefense world for 35 years and [has] never seen anyone who is as capable and who \ncares as much about what he does,\u201d than Applicant. (Tr. 105) Applicant has consistently \nearned positive performance evaluations. (Answer at 6) \n \n \nApplicant is active in the community, serving on the board of directors of his \nhomeowner\u2019s association. (Answer at 6) Also, he is an assistant coach for his son\u2019s \nsoccer team. \n \n \nApplicant has no investments in Russia. His home is valued at $430,000 and he \nhas cash savings of $40,000. (Answer at 5) \n \n \n \nRussia poses a cyber-espionage, influence, and attack threat to the United \nStates. (HE I, Att. 2 at 1) It uses cyber-espionage to inform its decision-making and \nbenefit its economic interests. (HE I, Att. 3 at 2) Since at least 2007, Russia\u2019s state-\nsponsored cyber program has routinely collected intelligence on defense and \ngeopolitical issues, including those relating to the United States. (Id.) Russia\u2019s efforts to \ninfluence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of its \nlongstanding desire to undermine the U.S. - led liberal democratic order. (HE I, Att. 5 at \n1) These efforts marked a significant escalation of past attempts to influence U.S. \nelections. On December 19, 2018, the U.S. Departments of State and the Treasury \nannounced sanctions against Russia for its \u201ccontinued and blatant disregard for \ninternational norms.\u201d (HE I, Att. 1 at 1)  \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nRussia has an abysmal human rights record. Issues include extrajudicial killings, \nenforced disappearances, arbitrary arrest, torture, and the severe suppression of the \nmedia. (HE I, Att. 21 at 1) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common-sense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Russia is an adversary that has historically sought to \nundermine Western, liberal values and is seeking to expand its influence worldwide \nthrough any means necessary, including espionage, cyberattacks, and interference in \nforeign elections. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother \nand brother, both, Russian citizens and residents trigger the application of AG \u00b6 7(a), \n\u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if \nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion.\u201d  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n  \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law has been a U.S. citizen for 30 years. He immigrated \nfrom the former Soviet regime upon being granted political asylum to live in the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has been a U.S. citizen since 2018, and she lives with \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law. These relationships do not generate a security concern. \n \n  \nAny contacts who are Russian citizens and residents, other than Applicant\u2019s \nmother and brother, are mere acquaintances of Applicant, as he communicates with \nthem infrequently. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 7(a) applies, but it is mitigated by \nAG \u00b6 8(d), \u201ccontact or communications with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern generated by \nthese contacts. \n \n  \nAlthough Applicant and his half-brother are currently not in frequent contact, this \nwas not always the case, as Applicant\u2019s half-brother considered immigrating to the \nUnited States to purchase and manage two gas stations. Although he ultimately did not \nimmigrate here, he provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to Applicant to help him \noperate the gas station. The nature and significance of this business relationship is too \nrecent to conclude that their relationship is casual. \n \n  \nAs for Applicant\u2019s mother, his bond with her has increased since his father died \nand her health has worsened. Unlike Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brother, whom he \ndid not know that well growing up, he has always been close to his mother, going so far \nas to obtain Russian citizenship for his then toddler daughter to facilitate a trip to Russia \nto visit his mother. \n \n  \nAs a repressive, autocratic country that conducts more espionage against the \nUnited States than nearly every country in the world, it is axiomatic that Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his Russian family members poses a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, or coercion. However, whether this heightened \nrisk is disqualifying is only half of the analysis. The heightened risk analysis is ultimately \ndependent upon how Applicant would respond if the Russian government attempted to \nextort information from him by threatening either the physical or financial well-being of \nhis relatives. Based upon the deep, longstanding ties Applicant has cultivated in the \nUnited States since immigrating 20 years ago, his cultural integration into his \ncommunity, as exemplified by his soccer coaching and service on the homeowner\u2019s \nassociation, his friendships, his financial ties, and the professional goodwill that he has \ndeveloped during his outstanding career, I conclude that \u201cthere is no conflict of interest . \n. . because [he] has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States that [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) I conclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence \nsecurity concern.      \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nIn reaching this decision, I found the testimony of Applicant\u2019s colleague, the \nretired Army lieutenant colonel, regarding Applicant\u2019s unparalleled commitment to his \nwork to be particularly persuasive.  \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He worked \nas a local-hire translator for the U.S. military from August 2008 until October 2010, when \nhe immigrated to the United States. Since he moved to the United States., Applicant \nreceived a certification in an undisclosed field and an associate\u2019s degree from U.S. \ninstitutions. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5) \nApplicant\u2019s father, two brothers, and two sisters are residents and citizens of Iraq. \nAdditionally, his aunt and brother-in-law are residents and citizens of Iraq. When \nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in 2018, he returned to Iraq for her funeral. During the \nthree weeks he was in Iraq, he stayed with his family. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5)  \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members are employed by the Iraqi government or \nmilitary. He has varying contact with them via phone conversations and text messages. \nThe last time he saw his family was during his 2018 visit to Iraq. Applicant gave his brother \n$5,000 to help pay for his mother\u2019s funeral expenses. He had previously given him a total \nof $2,000 between 2012 and 2014. (Item 4; Item 5) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s mother passed away, he inherited 20 percent of her home, which \nis worth an estimated $50,000. During his September 2018 personal subject interview, \nhe indicated that he intended to retain his share of the family home and would also stay \nthere when he visited his family. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the home \nis for sale. (Item 1; Item 4; Item 5) \nThere is no evidence that Applicant owns a home or other property in the United \nStates. Nor does he have any family living in the United States. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5) \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous \nand the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. \ncitizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist \nand insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nsecurity forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens \nand western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)   \n  \n  \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include \npress, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \nminorities; seizure of property without due process; and limitations of worker rights. (HE \nI) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n   \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nApplicant has ongoing familial connections with father and four siblings in Iraq. He \nhas provided them with financial support and visited them in 2018. Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith these family members creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because of the risk of terrorism and human rights abuses in Iraq. The record \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nApplicant owns a portion of his mother\u2019s home in Iraq, worth approximately \n$10,000. There is no evidence that he owns property in the United States, nor did he \nprovide information as to financial interests in the United States. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has lived in the United States since August 2010; however, there is no \nevidence that he has significant familial or financial ties in the United States. Additionally, \nhe has not demonstrated that his ties and allegiance to Iraq are minimal, or he can be \nexpected to resolve conflict or interest in favor of the United States. Even though he \nworked as a local-hire translator for U.S. Forces, he did not provide sufficient information \nabout his duties then to conclude that he has any deep seated ties to the U.S. \n \nThe instability, human rights abuses, and risk of terrorism in Iraq present an \nunacceptable risk that Applicant may be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of a foreign individual, group, or government and the interests of the United \nStates. Mitigation was not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), or 8(f).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns at issue. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nCAROLINE E.

After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for this contractor as an engineer for approximately two and a half years. Before his current position, he owned a small business for 18 years, which provided software support. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has been married twice previously. His first marriage was from 1997 to 2010 and his second marriage was from 2011 to 2015. He currently resides with his girlfriend who he has seen since 2015. He has four children. (Tr. 7, 19- 20, 22-25, 51; GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant had a foreclosed-mortgage account in the amount of approximately $70,155; five past-due medical accounts totaling approximately $1,476; and one collection account totaling $978.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 \n(AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 3, 2019, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on November 21, 2019, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on December 18, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \n\n \n2 \n \nidentified as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered one exhibit (AE A), \nwhich was admitted without objection. The record remained open until January 15, \n2020, to allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He submitted AE B through \nF, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are \nincorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nthis contractor as an engineer for approximately two and a half years. Before his current \nposition, he owned a small business for 18 years, which provided software support. He \nhas a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has been married twice previously. His first marriage was \nfrom 1997 to 2010 and his second marriage was from 2011 to 2015. He currently \nresides with his girlfriend who he has seen since 2015. He has four children. (Tr. 7, 19-\n20, 22-25, 51; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had a foreclosed-mortgage account in the amount of \napproximately $70,155; five past-due medical accounts totaling approximately $1,476; \nand one collection account totaling $978. The debts were listed in credit reports from \nSeptember 2017 and November 2018. Credit reports from June 2019 and December \n2019 show no delinquent debts, except for the foreclosure. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g). (GE 3-5, \n8)   \n \n \nApplicant credibly explained that the large mortgage debt was incurred during his \nfirst marriage when he and his first wife purchased a house. When the two divorced in \n2010, his ex-wife was awarded the house, which apparently had increased in equity \nduring their marriage. His ex-wife was ordered to refinance the property and pay \nApplicant his share of the equity. She failed to do so. In December 2010, Applicant \nexecuted a warranty deed in favor of his ex-wife. His action relieved him of any \nownership rights to the property. At that point, he believed his financial responsibility \nregarding this property was over. He provided documentation showing the executed \nwarranty deed that was filed in February 2012. This is the same property that was \nforeclosed in 2016. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 18-20, 31-33; GE 6-7; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant incurred his medical debts (except for SOR \u00b6 1.e, which was a dental \ndebt) as a result of his type 1 diabetes. The expenses were largely related to acquiring \nmedical equipment for the treatment of his diabetes. He fell behind with his payments \nbecause his girlfriend was diagnosed with cancer and he began assisting her with those \nexpenses. He worked out a verbal agreement with his medical creditor (the same \ncompany that supplies his diabetes equipment) and is on a repayment schedule where \nhe is paying $25 monthly, or more when he is able. He documented making four $50 \npayments from August through November 2019. The debts do not appear on his latest \ncredit report. These debts are being resolved. (Tr. 37-39; GE 8; AE D) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe dental debt that went to collection was caused by a mistake. Payment for the \nservice was to be taken out of Applicant\u2019s paycheck, but that did not occur. The debt \nwas ultimately paid through a garnishment action in December 2019. This debt is \nresolved. (Tr. 41; AE E) \n \n \nApplicant has not incurred any additional delinquent debts. He is expecting a \nsalary raise of approximately $22,000 this coming year and his current salary is \napproximately $104,000 (with overtime). He has not sought financial counseling, but he \nand his girlfriend utilize a monthly budget. He documented contributing more funds to \nhis health savings account so that he will not incur high out-of-pocket medical costs \nwithout a payment source. Applicant provided two years\u2019 worth of work appraisals, \nwhich reflect that he has \u201cmet expectations.\u201d (Tr. 28, 42; AE C, F)    \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n4 \n \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe evidence showed Applicant accrued several delinquent collection debts and \na mortgage foreclosure. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n5 \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant provided documentation showing that he executed a warranty deed to \nhis ex-wife thereby taking responsible action pursuant to the divorce. He established a \npayment plan for the unpaid medical debts and documented that he is adhering to the \nplan. The final debt was resolved through his garnishment payments. The foreclosure \nwas somewhat beyond his control because his ex-wife controlled the property after their \ndivorce. There are clear indications that his financial issues are resolved and that \nrecurrence is unlikely. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(b) are \npartially applicable.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \n\n \n6 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, and the circumstances \nsurrounding his indebtedness. I am convinced that Applicant will not incur delinquent \ndebts in the future.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 26, has never married nor had children. He earned his high school diploma in 2011. He is one course shy of earning a degree from the university he attended between August 2011 and May 2016. He has been employed as an engineer by a defense contractor since May 2016. (Items 3, 4; Item 5 at 4) The SOR alleged Guideline H and E concerns involving Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, including after having been granted access to classified information (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a). It also alleged Guideline E concerns involving Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications of SCA1 and SCA2 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.e), 2017 driving under the influence (DUI) arrest (SOR \u00b6 2.d), and 2012 open container citation (SOR \u00b6 2.f).

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) on March 7, 2012 \n(SCA1) and April 13, 2018 (SCA2). On June 26, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 15, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On September 27, 2019, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on September 30, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019, and did not respond. Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 \nthrough 6 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on November 26, \n2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 26, has never married nor had children. He earned his high school \ndiploma in 2011. He is one course shy of earning a degree from the university he attended \nbetween August 2011 and May 2016. He has been employed as an engineer by a defense \ncontractor since May 2016. (Items 3, 4; Item 5 at 4) \n \nThe SOR alleged Guideline H and E concerns involving Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana, including after having been granted access to classified information (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, and 2.a). It also alleged Guideline E concerns involving Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nfalsifications of SCA1 and SCA2 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.e), 2017 driving under the influence \n(DUI) arrest (SOR \u00b6 2.d), and 2012 open container citation (SOR \u00b6 2.f). He admitted each \nof the SOR allegations and proffered facts in support of mitigation. Although he answered \n\u201cI admit\u201d to the allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.e, given his accompanying \nexplanations, I conclude that he denied deliberately falsifying SCA1 and SCA2. (Item 2)  \n \nApplicant underwent his first background investigation for a DOD clearance, \napparently in connection with an engineering internship he had with a department of the \nU.S. Navy. The record did not explain the reason for the delay between his submission \nof SCA1 in 2012 and the internship that occurred in 2015. The current background \ninvestigation was initiated by SCA2, which Applicant submitted in April 2018. The record \ndid not address the status of any interim or final clearances that he may have been \ngranted in connection with the first investigation. There is also no information in the record \nas to whether Applicant was granted an interim clearance pending adjudication of the \ncurrent investigation. The Government did not otherwise establish that Applicant was \ngranted access to classified information as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Item 2 at 35; Item 3 at \n38-39; Item 4 at 34; Item 5 at 6-7; Items 6 and 7) \n \nApplicant did not report any illegal drug use on either SCA1 or SCA2. In June 2018, \nhe was interviewed twice in connection with SCA2. During the first interview, he initially \nreported that he used marijuana only about three times during his sophomore year of \ncollege between 2011 and 2012. He described his use as \u201cexperimental\u201d and \u201cisolated.\u201d \n(Item 3 at 23-24; Item 4 at 30-31; Item 5 at 5-6, 10) \n \nThroughout the course of the second interview, he reported three additional \ninstances of marijuana use, about which he claimed his memory had been refreshed after \nthe first interview. As to each instance, he denied \u201cknowingly\u201d using marijuana. The first \ninstance occurred in about December 2017, when Applicant asserted that he \u201cmay have\u201d \nconsumed a food product infused with marijuana while at a party. He did not know the \nfood product \u201cpossibly\u201d contained marijuana until three days after the party when a friend \ntold him that he heard that there were marijuana-infused food products at the party. (Item \n5 at 7) \n\n \n3 \n \nThe second instance occurred during a camping trip in April 2018. He was offered \na cigar by individuals previously unknown to him whom he had befriended. It was only \nafter he took one puff of the cigar that he realized it contained marijuana, whereupon he \nimmediately stopped smoking it because he knew that the federal government does not \nallow marijuana use. He described that use as \u201caccidental.\u201d The third instance occurred \na few days after the first interview, when he tested positive for marijuana on a drug test \nhe was administered in connection with his DUI treatment program. However, he denied \nthat he smoked any marijuana after April 2018. At the conclusion of the second interview, \nhe stated that there were \u201cno further issues\u201d with marijuana that \u201che could recall.\u201d (Item 5 \nat 6-7) \n \nApplicant reported two alcohol-related offenses on his SCAs, although he reported \nhis DUI as nolle prosequi. He was fined for an open container violation in March 2012. \nHe was arrested and charged with DUI of alcohol in October 2017. In January 2018, he \npled guilty and received probation before judgment, the terms of which included \nunsupervised probation (of an unspecified duration) and installation of an interlock device \non his vehicle for six months. Upon the advice of counsel, he voluntarily underwent \nalcohol treatment to assist with his court case. He asserted that the DUI was an \u201cisolated \nincident.\u201d He abstained from alcohol for an unspecified period following his arrest. \nThereafter, he maintained that he no longer intended to drive after consuming alcohol \nand planned to consume alcohol \u201cmore responsibly.\u201d As of June 2018, his consumption \nusually consisted of approximately two beers, but he admitted to having consumed beer \nto intoxication (approximately six beers) on two occasions in the prior six months. (Item 3 \nat 22; Item 4 at 28-29; Item 5 at 4-5, 8; Item 6 at 3-4, 14) \n \nAfter being diagnosed with \u201calcohol abuse, uncomplicated\u201d during his initial intake \nin December 2017, Applicant was admitted to a 12-week outpatient DUI program to begin \nin January 2018. His discharge date was projected to be in April 2018. His treatment plan \nincluded weekly group sessions, monthly individual sessions, and weekly urinalyses and \nbreathalyzer testing. His discharge was delayed due, in part, to his work schedule, and, \nin part, because of testing positive for marijuana on his urinalyses. He tested positive on \neach of the 11 urinalyses administered from December 2017 through July 2018. His \ncounselor noted that the final three urinalysis results indicated that Applicant was recently \nabstinent from marijuana, which was a requirement for his discharge. Applicant was \ndischarged in July 2018, at which time it was noted that his \u201ccondition\u201d had improved and \nthat his prognosis was \u201cfair.\u201d (Item 5 at 6, 7; Item 6 at 11, 12, 13, 14, 16) \n \nIn his August 2019 SOR answer, Applicant denied any \u201cconscious\u201d marijuana use \nafter college. He stated that \u201call conscious use of marijuana was strictly in the years and \nenvironment of college attendance,\u201d and that \u201cthe two instances of post-college marijuana \nconsumption was unknowing.\u201d He declared his intent not to use any illegal substances \nfor the \u201cduration of [his] clearance,\u201d knowing that it would \u201cjeopardize\u201d his ability to \nmaintain a security clearance. He also stated that he \u201cwould be willing to provide annual, \nsemi-annual, or monthly drug screenings to prove . . . [his] determination and willingness \nto abide by the regulations of [his] clearance.\u201d (Item 2) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAs of June 2018, Applicant asserted that he no longer associated with persons \nwho use illegal substances or frequented places where illegal substances were being \nused. As of May 2019, he averred that he was focusing more on work and his health \nrather than social events, and avoiding situations where he was not in control of his \nenvironment. He had recently completed a half marathon and was coaching a youth \nsoccer team. (Item 2, Item 5 at 7, 10, 11) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n\n \n5 \n \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nThe facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \n \nThe SOR alleged facts that rendered AG \u00b6 25 (f), any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position, potentially applicable. \nHowever, the Government did not establish that Applicant was granted access to \nclassified information. Thus, I find that there is insufficient record evidence to apply AG \u00b6 \n25(f). Accordingly, I find in favor of Applicant that portion of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a that refers \nto his use of marijuana after having been granted access to classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \n \nAny illegal drug use is troubling in the context of evaluating security worthiness. If \nApplicant had ceased all illegal drug use after college, he could have demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation and mitigated any drug-involvement concerns. However, he not \nonly continued using marijuana after college and while employed by a defense contractor, \nbut he was also not candid about his post-college use during the security clearance \nprocess. Abstaining from marijuana use was a requirement for Applicant\u2019s discharge from \nhis DUI program. He tested positive for marijuana on each of the 11 urinalyses \nadministered from December 2017 through July 2018, although his final three tests \nsuggested that he had then been recently abstinent. Given his lack of candor, I question \nnot only the frequency of the marijuana use that Applicant self-reported, but also the \nsincerity of his commitment to abstinence. The facts and circumstances surrounding \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use raise substantial doubts about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \n\n \n7 \n \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe above-stated general concern is established by Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, \nand his 2012 and 2017 alcohol-related misconduct. He was not honest about his \nmarijuana use during the security clearance process. These facts also establish the \nfollowing specific disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time of the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \nAn applicant\u2019s education and experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to \ndisclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR \nCase No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010) \n \nApplicant had used marijuana during the preceding seven years reportable on \nSCA1 and SCA2. I did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations and excuses for his \nfailure to report any marijuana use on SCA1 and SCA2. His continued lack of candor \nduring the security clearance process suggests that he was aware of the potentially \nnegative impact his marijuana use could have on his security clearance. Accordingly, I \nfind substantial evidence of an intent on the part of Applicant to omit and conceal \nmaterially relevant information from SCA 1 and SCA 2. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nestablished.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nNone of the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline \nare fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \n \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in requesting \na security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the honesty of the \napplicant. The Appeal Board has stressed the importance of providing full and frank \nanswers on the SCA:  \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. That \ncompelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in being \nable to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the \ngovernment in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use and his 2012 and 2017 alcohol-related misconduct \nunderscore a pattern of poor judgment that also calls into question his ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. His deliberate lack of candor during the \nsecurity clearance process is particularly egregious. Applicant failed to demonstrate a \nsufficient pattern of responsible behavior for me to conclude that his questionable \njudgment is behind him. I have serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \n\n \n9 \n \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his marijuana use and lack of candor about it during the security \nclearance process, nor his 2012 and 2017 alcohol-related misconduct. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.d \u2013 2.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 14, 2016. On \nSeptember 5, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2019, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing. On November 13, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 4. He was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \nNovember 18, 2019, and did not respond. Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. I \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted Items 3 and 4 into evidence. The case was assigned to me on January 22, \n2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 63, is divorced without children. He received his GED in 1975. He \ngraduated from a police academy in 1979. He received a HAZMAT technician \ncertification in 1991. He earned two electrician certifications in 2004. Most recently, he \nhas been employed as an electrician by a defense contractor since July 2016. This is \nhis first application for a security clearance. (Item 3) \n \nIn his July 2016 SCA, Applicant reported that he failed to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2014. He asserted that his certified public \naccountant (CPA) was in the process of preparing them for filing. He also stated that he \nexpected to receive refunds. (Item 3 at 46-47) \n \nDuring his June 2017 security clearance interview (SI), Applicant revealed that \nhe had not yet filed his returns for tax years 2012 through 2014. He claimed to have \nprovided his CPA with the information necessary to file them sometime in 2017. He \npromised to file them by the end of 2017. He asserted that his 2015 and 2016 federal \nand state income tax returns had been filed on unspecified dates, without providing any \ncorroborating documentation. Without providing any details, he attributed his delinquent \nfilings to being a single man working overtime and caring for his ailing mother, who \npassed away in November 2016. During his June 2018 SI, he acknowledged that he \nhad not yet filed any federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, 2014, \n2016, and 2017. He declared that he misspoke during this 2017 SI due to \u201chuman error\u201d \nwhen he stated that he already filed his 2016 return. (Item 2 at 3; Item 4 at 3, 9-10) \n \nIn his July 2019 responses to interrogatories, Applicant claimed that his 2015 and \n2018 federal and state income tax returns were filed in April 2019. He asserted that he \nplanned to file his 2017 returns in July 2019, and his 2016 returns at a future \nunspecified time. He claimed that he did not owe any taxes for tax year 2015, and paid \napproximately $1,075 to the IRS and state for tax year 2018. He did not clearly \narticulate a plan for filing his 2012 through 2014 returns. He mentioned that it was \nbeyond the three years during which he would have been eligible for a refund for those \ntax years, and then suggested that he might believe that he would not be required to \npay any taxes after that three-year period. He maintained that he was unable to file all \nof the delinquent returns at the same time because he did not have sufficient funds to \npay his CPA\u2019s fees all at once. He did not provide any documents corroborating the \nreturn filings or tax payment for tax years 2015 and 2018. (Item 4 at 13-14) \n \nIn his September 2019 SOR response, Applicant reaffirmed that his 2015, 2017, \nand 2018 federal and state income tax returns had been filed. For unspecified reasons, \nhe had not received the full refund he was expecting from either the IRS or the state for \ntax year 2015. He claimed to have paid an unspecified amount for taxes, late fees, and \npenalties for tax year 2017. He did not provide any documents corroborating the return \nfilings or tax payments for tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018. He proffered the schedule \n\n \n3 \n \nby which he planned to file the remaining delinquent returns. Although he was expecting \nrefunds, he understood that he will not know the status of his tax liability, which could \ninclude late fees and penalties, until after the returns are filed and processed. He \nplanned to file his 2014 and 2016 returns first, within 30 to 45 days from the date of his \nSOR response. Then, he would file his 2012 and 2013 returns within 30 to 45 days from \nthe date he resolved any tax liability for tax years 2014 and 2016. The purpose of the \nstaggered scheduling was to ensure that he had sufficient funds to pay any tax liability \nowed. He also vaguely suggested that he may not yet have provided all of the \ninformation necessary for his CPA to file the delinquent returns. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant was unemployed for unspecified reasons from April 2010 through \n2012, and six times between September 2012 and February 2015 for one to three-\nmonth periods each. He supported himself with unemployment compensation and \nsavings. In June 2017, he described his financial status as \u201ctight.\u201d The record did not \notherwise specify details about his ability to meet his expenses, including CPA fees and \ntaxes. (Item 4 at 5-6, 10) \n \nApplicant is a patriot who believes strongly in supporting the United States. He is \ndedicated to his craft. He desires to serve his country and vowed that he would be \ndiligent in protecting any classified information to which he is entrusted. Numerous \nmembers of his family have served in the U.S. military with distinction, including his \nfather who was among the first to train as a member of the U.S. Navy underwater \ndemolition team and an uncle who was a WWII fighter pilot. (Item 2; Item 4 at 15) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Egan at 527. \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n4 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n\n \n5 \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying condition: AG \u00b6 19(f) \n(failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). None of the \nfollowing potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline are \nestablished: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant failed to clearly establish that he filed his delinquent federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018, or that he has no outstanding \ntax liabilities for those tax years. Even if I were to accept, without corroborating \nevidence, that he filed his returns and resolved his tax obligations for tax years 2015, \n2017, and 2018, he has not yet filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2014 and 2016. Moreover, the associated tax liability for those \nyears remains unknown. There is insufficient information in the record to establish that \nApplicant\u2019s initial failure to timely file his returns resulted largely from circumstances that \nwere beyond his control, or that he acted responsibly to address the issue in the years \nthat followed.  \n \nThe fact that Applicant expected refunds or may not have been able afford to pay \nhis taxes does not absolve him of the obligation to timely file his income tax returns, \nwithout justifiable reasons. He repeatedly failed to follow through on his promises to file \nhis delinquent returns and resolve his unknown tax liability at multiple stages of the \nsecurity clearance process. This persistent procrastination and avoidance surrounding \nhis tax obligations calls into question his suitability for access to classified information. \n \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing \nincome tax returns when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR \n\n \n6 \n \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \u201cFailure to file income tax returns \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is \nessential for protecting classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). I am left with doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Thus, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F \nconcerns at this time. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns over an \nextended period. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old general manager for a defense contractor, employed since approximately January 2019. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1993 and a master\u2019s degree in 2009. He married in 1991 and divorced in 2010. He remarried in 2014. He has two children and a stepchild, all adults. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1993 to November 2018. He did not submit information regarding combat area deployments or awards. He last served in overseas assignments in Japan (2011 to 2015) and Germany (2015 to 2018). He retired in November 2018 with the rank of Colonel (0- 6). The SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $61,245 in delinquent student loans. Specifically, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d allege two defaulted government student loans placed for collection by the U.S. Department of Education for $24,788 and $6,121, 3 respectively. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege two defaulted private student loans placed for collection for $19,152 and $7,373, respectively. The SOR allegations are supported by sufficient evidence in the record. Applicant\u2019s student loans originated from 2007 to 2009 when he obtained federally subsidized and non-federally subsidized loans. (Item 5) Applicant\u2019s 2014 credit report (Item 10) shows the private student loans were deferred at one time, but were reported delinquent 150 days past due date with delinquencies occurring in March and April 2014.

The evidence is sufficient to partially mitigate Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial consideration security concerns. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant, \nalbeit on a conditional basis with additional measures. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 30, 2016 \nwhile on active duty in the United States Army. On August 15, 2017, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a letter of intent \n(LOI) to revoke eligibility for access to classified information, assignment to sensitive \nduties, and access to sensitive compartmented Information (SCI). The LOI included a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Applicant received the SOR on November 24, 2017, and answered it \nwith an undated letter, submitted in early 2018. \n \nOn May 3, 2018, Applicant was issued a supplemental SOR that included \nadditional student loan delinquencies obtained from an updated credit report. On \n\n \n2 \n \nSeptember 2, 2018 the DOD CAF revoked Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and access to \nSCI, stating that it did not receive a response to the supplemental SOR. Applicant stated \nthat he never received the supplemental SOR. (AE A-6) This is supported by Applicant\u2019s \nactive duty Joint Personnel Adjudications System (JPAS) page that shows that \nApplicant\u2019s clearance eligibility was listed as \u201cpending his reply\u201d to the August 2017 SOR. \nThere is no mention of the May 2018 supplemental SOR or subsequent revocation of his \nclearance. (AE A-4) \n \nApplicant retired from the U.S. Army in November 2018, and was employed as a \ncivilian contractor in approximately January 2019. (AE A-4) In response to a renewed \nrequest from his civilian employer for security eligibility, the DOD CAF reissued Applicant \nan SOR on August 29, 2019, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after \nJune 8, 2017. This is the SOR at issue in this case. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 7, 2019, and requested a decision by an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) based on \nthe written record without a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief with supporting \ndocuments, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), was submitted by Department \nCounsel on March 2, 2020. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, \nwho was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, rebut, or \nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM and submitted a reply that \nwas received by DOHA on April 24, 2020. The case was assigned to me on June 12, \n2020. Applicant provided Applicant Exhibit (AE) A in response to the FORM, and did not \nobject to admission of a personal subject interview (PSI) summary (GE 4). Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 10 and (AE) A are admitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old general manager for a defense contractor, employed \nsince approximately January 2019. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1993 and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2009. He married in 1991 and divorced in 2010. He remarried in 2014. \nHe has two children and a stepchild, all adults. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army \nfrom 1993 to November 2018. He did not submit information regarding combat area \ndeployments or awards. He last served in overseas assignments in Japan (2011 to 2015) \nand Germany (2015 to 2018). He retired in November 2018 with the rank of Colonel (0-\n6). \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $61,245 in delinquent student \nloans. Specifically, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d allege two defaulted government student loans \nplaced for collection by the U.S. Department of Education for $24,788 and $6,121, \n\n \n3 \n \nrespectively. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege two defaulted private student loans placed for \ncollection for $19,152 and $7,373, respectively. The SOR allegations are supported by \nsufficient evidence in the record. \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loans originated from 2007 to 2009 when he obtained federally \nsubsidized and non-federally subsidized loans. (Item 5) Applicant\u2019s 2014 credit report \n(Item 10) shows the private student loans were deferred at one time, but were reported \ndelinquent 150 days past due date with delinquencies occurring in March and April 2014. \nThe government student loans were listed as deferred as well, but were reported 90 days \npast the due date three or more times, and reported delinquent in February and March \n2014. \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 2016 credit report (Item 9) shows multiple entries for student \nloans. Of note, the entries for three Department of Education loans (government loans) \nare listed as in a collection status, with May 2015 listed as the date of last activity (DLA). \nThe private loans were also listed as past due and in a collection status, with DLAs of \nFebruary 2015 and September 2016. Applicant\u2019s March 2020 credit report continues to \nshow the student-loan accounts listed in the SOR as either past due or in collections. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA of September 30, 2016, he did not list any student loan \ndelinquencies or past-due financial obligations, but he noted a home foreclosure in 2011 \ndue to his divorce and military assignment overseas. (Item 3)  \n \nApplicant was interviewed (PSI) in March 2017 in Germany by U.S. Department of \nState security personnel. He denied knowing his student loans were delinquent, and \nstated that he believed his loans were deferred while on deployment and stationed \noverseas. He noted that he submitted a deferment request for each of the loans in June \n2015, and possessed email confirmations. He explained that the credit report entries \nshowing the loans past due were due to deferments and administrative problems with the \naccounts. \n \nOn August 15, 2017, while Applicant was on active duty, the DOD CAF first issued \nApplicant an LOI and SOR alleging defaulted student loans. (Item 5) Applicant answered \nthe SOR with an undated letter, submitted in early 2018. (Item 5) Applicant claimed in his \nresponse to the first SOR that he was paying his student loans without incident until about \nMay 2015, when he resolved a legal dispute related to his divorce. As a result, he was \nrequired to pay alimony and child support. In addition, his new spouse was being treated \nfor cancer and was not working. He claimed that in 2015 he requested a \u201cforbearance\u201d \nfrom the student loan servicing companies from paying his student loans, and the \npayments were not to restart until mid-2016. (Item 5) Applicant did not submit confirmation \nof the forbearance requests. He noted that he then began an eight-month effort to discuss \nhis loan status with his creditors, but was stymied by the \u201coperational\u201d time differences \nbetween the U.S. and Europe, and difficulties getting information from the lenders. \n \nApplicant explained that he subsequently contacted the government student loans \nservicing agency and by February 2018, agreed to make three monthly payments of \n\n \n4 \n \n$1,088 each, with the expectation that after three payments, his government loans would \nbe consolidated. (Item 5) Applicant\u2019s submission with his response to the FORM shows \nonly one payment was made under this agreement, on February 7, 2018. (AE A-9) It is \nunclear why successive payments of $1,088 were not made per the agreement. The \nrecord shows that Applicant believed in April 2018 that his security issues were resolved. \n(AE A-4) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s October 2019 response to the current SOR, he noted that the \ngovernment loan was \u201centering\u201d a loan rehabilitation program. (Item 2) He stated that he \nprovided the required income/debt ratio information and was awaiting terms of payment \nand due dates. He said that on his own initiative, he began making $500 payments toward \nthe start of an anticipated nine-month payment plan. (Item 2) Applicant\u2019s subsequent \nresponse to the FORM shows that Applicant made a $50 payment on this account on \nAugust 29, 2019, and two $500 \u201cgood faith\u201d payments in September and October 2019, \nthat did not apply toward his rehabilitation program. He stated that he made these smaller \n\u201cgood faith\u201d payments as he attempted to negotiate lower \u201cqualifying\u201d payments and \ncomplete the required paperwork. (AE A) Payments on this account then ceased until \nJanuary 2020. (AE A-9) \n \nIn November 2019, Applicant agreed to pay the required amount on another \ngovernment loan rehabilitation program (labeled as loan 2 on his response to the FORM), \nand made four monthly payments of $1,281 beginning in January 2020. He stated that he \nis currently negotiating a more affordable repayment plan while maintaining \u201cmaximum\u201d \nmonthly payments on this account. He noted that \u201calthough [the government account] is \nstill in default,\u201d he is in compliance with the rehabilitation plan and expects completion of \nthe plan in September 2020. (AE A; A-9) \n \nOn August 13, 2019, Applicant agreed to participate in a loan-rehabilitation plan to \npay nine qualifying payments of $650 per month on the private student loans. Applicant \nbegan payments on July 31, 2019, and continued consistent monthly payments and \ncompleted the program on April 13, 2020. He was notified that the account was sold to \nanother lender, and he would be notified of the new repayment terms. (AE A-2; A-10) \n \nNo evidence of Applicant\u2019s current financial status or financial counseling was \nsubmitted. Applicant stressed his nearly 26 years of honorable service in the Army, his \ndifficult divorce in 2011 after 20 years of marriage, and difficulties with communications \nvia mail while stationed overseas. Applicant takes responsibility to repay his loans, and \nhe believes that as of September 2020, he will have met all of his student loan \nrehabilitation obligations. After that time, they will be considered current and no longer in \ndefault. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \n\n \n6 \n \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant noted his inability to pay his student loans because of his spouse\u2019s \nmedical treatments and legal dispute with his former spouse, along with difficulty in \ncommunications with lenders while stationed overseas. Although the loans were \napparently deferred at previous times (June 2015), Applicant claimed he requested his \nloans be held in forbearance in 2017, while he was stationed in Germany. No evidence \nof forbearance submissions was produced. Applicant failed to make all necessary \npayments on a rehabilitation agreement beginning in February 2018. He did not complete \nthe program. He made three irregular payments until he was able to start payments on a \nnew rehabilitation program starting in January 2020. He made four monthly payments \nand expects to continue regular payments until the program ends in September 2020, \nand the default status will be lifted.  \n \nApplicant successfully completed a rehabilitation program for his private student \nloans in April 2020, and expects to continue with regular monthly payments to a new \ncreditor. This account is no longer in a default status. AG \u00b6 20(a) and (d) partially apply. \n \nI am concerned with the undue delay Applicant showed in addressing his loan \nobligations over a number of years, and am unconvinced of his claim that his overseas \nassignments were contributing factors to his inability to resolve his student loan issues. \nApplicant appeared to be in financial distress due to his divorce and subsequent legal \nbattles, and the loss of his spouse\u2019s income while she was ill. However, his failure to \ndocument agreements with his creditors to delay his loan payments while he was in \nEurope, and subsequent failures to follow through with repayment agreements is \ninexcusable for a senior military officer. Applicant\u2019s vague explanations and excuses for \nthe accumulation of delinquent student loan debts and his failure to pay ring hollow. \nHowever, I acknowledge that Applicant has indeed finally brought his private loans \ncurrent, and is progressing with resolving his government loan delinquencies. These \nmitigation actions have convinced me that Applicant is finally in the end-stage of resolving \nhis delinquencies. \n \nGiven that the final resolution of Applicant\u2019s government student loan rehabilitation \nprograms remain pending, his efforts to date lead to a partial but not complete mitigation \nof the security concerns. Accordingly, under Appendix C to Enclosure 2 of the Directive, \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility is granted with the provision that he completes all required student \nloan rehabilitation payments and continues to make regular and consistent monthly \npayments in accordance with the current terms or subsequent repayment agreements. \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, and consistent with the \ndiscussion in the above paragraph, I have no doubts or concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and \nconsidered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. \nI also considered the whole-person factors, especially Applicant\u2019s service and \ndistinguished career in the United States Army. I conclude that he met his ultimate burden \nof persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \nconditional eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest of the United States \nto grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility granted on a \nconditional basis with additional security measures noted above.  \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/06/2020 \nDecision \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct), E (Personal Conduct), and F (Financial Considerations). Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 6, 2017. \nOn August 30, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines J, E, and F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n1 \n\n \n \n3, 2020, and the case was assigned to an administrative judge on February 6, 2020. On \nFebruary 24, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on \nMarch 18, 2020. On February 27, 2020, Applicant requested a change of venue due to \nhis reassignment to another duty station. On March 2, 2020, the hearing was cancelled. \nThe case was reassigned to me on March 10, 2020. The rescheduling of the \nhearing was delayed by the DOD worksite and travel restrictions due to the health risks \nposed by the COVID-19 virus. On July 31, 2020, DOHA notified Applicant that the hearing \nwas rescheduled for August 24, 2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified \nbut did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 2, 2020. \nI kept the record open until September 11, 2020, to enable Applicant to submit \ndocumentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, but \nthey were submitted in a password-protected format that I could not open. I extended the \ndeadline to allow him to submit his documents in a usable format. He resubmitted his \ndocuments on September 23, 2020, and the record closed on that day. AX A through E \nwere admitted without objection. \nAmendment of the SOR \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA and testified at the hearing that he owed a child-\nsupport arrearage of about $23,000. (GX 1 at 32; Tr. 26-27.) At the end of the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence by adding \nSOR \u00b6 3.d to allege, \u201cYou are indebted to the [state] in the approximate amount of \n$23,000 for child support arrears. As of August 24th, 2020, the arrearage remains unpaid.\u201d \nApplicant did not object to the amendment. I kept the record open until September 11, \n2020, to enable him to submit evidence regarding the medical debts, the child-support \narrearage alleged in the amended SOR, and evidence from co-workers, supervisors, and \nfriends about his trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. As noted above, I \nextended the deadline until September 23, 2020, when the record closed. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n, \n2.a, and 3.a-3.c. He denied the allegation of falsifying his SCA in SOR \u00b6 2.b. Although he \nstated that he admitted SOR \u00b6 2.c, also alleging that he falsified his SCA, he stated that \nhe was confused by the terminology of the question in his SCA. I have treated his \nresponse to SOR \u00b6 2.c as a denial. At the hearing, he admitted the additional allegation \nin SOR \u00b6 3.d. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \n2 \n\n \nBackground Information \nApplicant is a 39-year-old electrician employed by defense contractors since June \n2013. He has worked for his current employer since October 2018. He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Navy from October 2001 to July 2009 and received an honorable \ndischarge. He held a security clearance while in the Navy. He was unemployed from July \n2009 to June 2013. While unemployed, he attended a university from September 2009 to \nFebruary 2012 but did not receive a degree. \nApplicant married in January 2003 and divorced in February 2009. He has a 15\u00ad\nyear-old son born during this marriage, for whom he is required to pay child support of \n$700 per month. \n. \nCriminal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: In May 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with disorderly \nconduct and resisting arrest. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, was ordered to \nperform two days of community service, and was given a conditional discharge. (GX 3.) \nHe testified that the incident occurred when the police shut down a nightclub shortly after \nhe paid the entrance fee. He was demanding a refund of the entrance fee when a police \nofficer pushed him and told him to go outside. Applicant testified that the police officer \nwas verbally abusive and made derogatory comments. Applicant testified that he \u201cnudged \n[the officer] not really purposely,\u201d and had an angry verbal exchange with him, resulting \nin his arrest. (Tr. 30-31.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: In July 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with grand larceny, \nreckless endangerment (2nd degree), and unauthorized use of a vehicle without the \nowner\u2019s consent. He pleaded guilty to unauthorized use of a vehicle. (GX 6 at 6.) At the \nhearing, he testified that incident occurred after he was invited by some friends to go for \na \u201cjoy ride\u201d in a stolen vehicle, and he drove the vehicle a short distance until they were \nstopped by the police. He also testified that he received a ticket in the mail for driving the \nstolen car with a broken headlight and that he did not pay it, resulting in suspension of his \ndriver\u2019s license and his arrest in December 2002, discussed below. (Tr. 31-32.) In October \n2001, shortly after this incident, Applicant enlisted in the Navy. He testified that his \nenlistment removed him from bad company, made him feel proud, and gave him a \nhealthier perspective on life and a more positive social circle. (Tr. 33-34.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: In December 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating \na motor vehicle (the stolen vehicle involved in SOR \u00b6 1.b) without a license and \naggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle (3rd degree). He pleaded guilty to \noperating a motor vehicle without a license and was fined $50. (GX 3.) His license was \nsuspended for failure to pay the fine. (Tr. 32.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he \nwas unaware that his driver\u2019s license had been suspended because he was no longer \nliving in the state that had issued the license. \n3 \n\nSOR \u00b6 1.d: In December 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating \na vehicle on a suspended license. He admitted it in his answer to the SOR, but it is not \nreflected in any of the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing. At the hearing, \nApplicant testified that he was not sure about the disposition of this offense, because it \nhappened so long ago. (Tr. 57-58.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: In April 2004, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence \nof alcohol (DUI) and driving with a suspended or revoked license. He was alone and \nreturning from a party at a bar. He was stopped for speeding and failed a breathalyzer \ntest. (Tr. 34-35.) He pleaded guilty to DUI and was sentenced to confinement for one \nyear, with nine months suspended, suspension of his driver\u2019s license for one year, and a \n$900 fine. (GX 2 at 6-7.) He testified that his three months in jail was embarrassing and \ncaused him to miss the birth of his son. (Tr. 36.) He testified that he voluntarily completed \nan alcohol-education program offered by the VA. He was not diagnosed with an alcohol-\nabuse disorder on that occasion or any time thereafter. (Tr. 37.) \nSOR 1.f: In November 2004, Applicant was arrested on a capias warrant and \ncharged with a probation violation related to his DUI conviction in April 2004. In his answer \nto the SOR, he admitted this allegation and stated that his military obligations \u201crestrained \n[him] from taking necessary steps to resolve past issues.\u201d This arrest is not reflected in \nany of the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing. At the hearing, he was not \nsure of the reason for this charge, but he believed that it arose because the court would \nnot accept the VA education program as compliance with a court-ordered requirement for \ncompleting an alcohol-education program after his DUI conviction in April 2004. (Tr. 37-\n38.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: In September 2007, Applicant was charged with assault and battery \non a family member and threatening bodily harm. He was convicted of assault and battery, \nfined $200, and required to make restitution. (GX 4; GX 6 at 7.) At the hearing, he testified \nthat he was trying to leave his home, but his wife blocked the door to prevent him from \nleaving. He testified that he picked up his wife and threw her onto a sofa so that he could \nleave. His wife accused him of choking her and inflicting bruises, but he denied it. (Tr. 20, \n39-40.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: In March 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI) (2nd offense) and refusal of a blood or breath test (2nd offense). (GX 5 \nat 3-6; GX 6 at 8.) At the hearing, he testified he had consumed only one beer. He denied \nrefusing a breath test, but he testified that he pleaded guilty to both offenses on the advice \nof his lawyer. For the DWI, he was sentenced to confinement for 90 days, with 60 days \nsuspended; suspension of his operator\u2019s license for three years, and a $500 fine. For the \nrefusal of a blood or breath test, he was sentenced to confinement for 30 days, with 10 \ndays suspended, suspension of his operator\u2019s license for an additional three years, and \na $250 fine. He used public transportation to go to work, but he admitted that he continued \nto drive on short trips to school and the grocery store about three times a week while his \nlicense was suspended. (Tr. 41-44.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: In February 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating \na vehicle on a suspended or revoked license. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to \nconfinement for 365 days, suspended, probation for one year, and a $250 fine. (GX 5 at \n7.) He did not testify about the circumstances of this arrest and conviction. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: In May 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and \nbattery. In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he stated that he was charged due \nto false accusations by an ex-girlfriend. (Tr. 44-45.) The charges were dismissed. (GX 6 \nat 8.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: In December 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating \na vehicle with a suspended or revoked license, operating a vehicle with altered, forged, \nor fictitious license plates, and an illegal inspection sticker. He testified that he obtained \nthe license plates and inspection sticker from a friend because he was \u201cdestitute and \ndesperate\u201d and needed to drive to attend school and look for work. (Tr. 45-46.) He was \nconvicted of all offenses. For operating a vehicle with a suspended or revoked license, \nhe was sentenced to confinement for 90 days, with 80 days suspended, probation for 24 \nmonths, and suspension of his operator\u2019s license for two years. For the license plate \nviolation, he was sentenced to confinement for 60 days, with 40 days suspended. For the \ninspection sticker violation, he was sentenced to confinement for 30 days, suspended, \nand probation for 24 months. (GX 5 at 11-17.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: In April 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with contempt of \ncourt for failing to appear at a child-support hearing. He was found not guilty. (GX 6 at 8.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, he stated that neither he nor his lawyer knew the court date \nand that the judge apologized and dismissed the charge. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: During his background investigation, Applicant was interviewed by a \nsecurity investigator in October 2018. During that interview, he admitted that he was \narrested in 2015 and charged with driving a vehicle with a suspended driver\u2019s license, an \nexpired vehicle registration, and an expired safety inspection stocker. He pleaded guilty \nand was sentenced to confinement for ten days, with five days suspended, and a $600 \nfine. He served his five days of confinement on weekends. (GX 2 at 6.) Other than the \nsummary of Applicant\u2019s interview, there is no documentary evidence of this incident in the \nrecord, and he did not testify about it at the hearing. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: In December 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with making \na false statement on a criminal history form (a felony) and making a false statement to \nobtain a firearm. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of falsely identifying himself to a \nlaw enforcement officer. He was sentenced to confinement for 12 months (suspended) \nand probation for 12 months. (GX 6 at 9.) He stated that he was confused by the \nterminology of the question in the form asking about domestic violence. At the hearing, \nhe testified that he knew that he had been convicted of assault and battery on his then \nwife, but he was not specifically charged with domestic violence, and he did not know that \nhis offense was considered domestic violence until he was charged with falsifying his \napplication for a firearm purchase. (Tr. 47-51, 61.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: Cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing \nto disclose the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.m. When he submitted his SCA, \nhe answered \u201cYes\u201d in response to questions in Section 22 of his SCA, asking if in the past \nseven years he had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in a criminal \nproceeding; been arrested by any law enforcement official; or had been charged, \nconvicted, or sentenced in any court. He disclosed the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.n, but he did not disclose the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.m. (GX \n1 at 24-25.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he did not intentionally falsify \ninformation, but that his \u201crollercoaster of events\u201d in his past made recollection of specific \nevents unclear. At the hearing, he did not testify and was not questioned about this \nallegation. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing \nto disclose the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.j, and 1.n. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions \nin his SCA asking whether he had ever been charged with a felony or had even been \nconvicted of an offense involving domestic violence. He did not disclose the criminal \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.j, both alleging assault and battery on a family \nmember. He did not disclose the felony charge alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n, but he disclosed his \nconviction of a misdemeanor as a lesser-included offense of the felony. (GX 1 at 26.) In \nhis answer to the SOR, he admitted that he was charged with a felony for falsifying his \nfirearms application but convicted of a misdemeanor. At the hearing, he testified that he \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the question about domestic violence because he did not know that \nassault on a family member was considered domestic violence. However, he admitted at \nthe hearing that he learned in December 2015, well before he submitted his SCA, that \nassault and battery on a family member was considered domestic violence, which was \nwhy he was charged with falsifying his application to purchase a firearm. (Tr. 60-62.) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.c alleges three medical debts placed for collection of $380, \n$178, and $704. The debts are reflected in the credit report from November 2017 as \nreferred for collection and reflected in the credit report from January 2020 as unpaid (GX \n8; GX 9.) Applicant admitted these allegations, but he stated in his answer to the SOR \nand at the hearing that he received care for a medical emergency and believed the \nmedical care was covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He provided no \ndetails about the nature of the medical emergency. He testified that his VA medical \nbenefits were not active when he received the treatment because he did not have a \nprimary care doctor. He testified that he contacted the VA, and that the VA told him it \nwould handle the debts. Finally, he testified that he was offered a settlement of the $704 \ndebt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c, which he accepted and paid, but he admitted that the other \ndebts were not resolved. (Tr. 24-25.). After the hearing, he submitted documentary \nevidence that the $704 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c was settled. (AX A.) He did not submit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany documentary evidence showing efforts to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and \n3.b, which remain unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 3.d alleges a child-support arrearage of about $23,000. The arrearage is \nnot reflected in the two credit reports submitted by Department Counsel. (GX 8 and 9.) \nApplicant disclosed the arrearage in his SCA and admitted it at the hearing. (GX 1 at 32; \nTr. 26-27.) He has $700 per month deducted from his pay, but the deduction is for his \nmonthly payments and not the arrearage. The record does not reflect whether the \ndeduction is court-ordered or was voluntarily initiated by Applicant. He has taken no action \nto resolve the arrearage. \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s program director states that he has demonstrated that he is a \u201chighly \nreliable, self-motivated, and trusted employee\u201d since he was hired in October 2018. He \nconsiders Applicant to be dependable, responsible, honest, and courteous. (AX E.) \nApplicant\u2019s production manager for the last six months states that his hard work \u201chas \ndistinguished him as a cut above others and his trustworthiness cannot be understated.\u201d \nHe describes Applicant as personable, with a cheery and hardworking attitude, and a \ntrustworthy teammate who keeps spirits up among his comrades. (AX C.) Applicant\u2019s \nprevious production manager from June 2013 to October 2018 states that he displayed \nthe \u201cutmost level of professionalism\u201d with the potential to become a leader in his field. (AX \nD.) \nA placement specialist at a community organization providing workforce \ndevelopment for disadvantaged and low-income workers in the construction industry, who \nhas known Applicant for about five years, regards him as a \u201cchanged person with good \nmoral character,\u201d who is \u201crespectful, committed, trustworthy, ambitious, and a man of the \nhighest integrity.\u201d She invited Applicant to be a guest speaker about leadership and \nsupervisory roles for electricians. She described how Applicant was open about his past \ncriminal record, and he encouraged his audience to have the courage to change and to \nnot allow past mistakes to define them. She stated that, a month later, the students were \nstill inspired by Applicant\u2019s remarks. (AX B.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d The evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. More than four years have passed since \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest and conviction, but it was preceded by fifteen years of \ncriminal conduct. Furthermore, he falsified his current SCA and persisted in his \nimplausible explanations for his falsifications in his response to the SOR and at the \nhearing. I am not convinced that his irresponsible behavior will not recur. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the assault and battery alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, \nwhich was based on a false accusation and for the contempt of court alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.l, which was caused by the failure of court personnel to notify Applicant \nand his lawyer of a hearing. Both charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. \nThis mitigating condition is not established for the other criminal conduct alleged \n9 \n\n \n \nin the SOR. I have noted that there was no documentary evidence presented to \nsupport the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f, but those allegations were \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s supervisors since October 2016 \nhave attested to his outstanding performance, trustworthiness, and positive \nattitude. His work with a community organization dedicated to helping \ndisadvantaged and low-income members of the community is commendable. \nHowever, his lack of candor in his SCA and his implausible explanations for his \nlack of candor preclude a finding that he is rehabilitated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is a mature, experienced, and well-educated adult. His explanation for \nfailing to disclose the criminal conduct alleged in SOR 1.i through 1.m was implausible \nand unconvincing. While he may not have recalled the details of all his multiple arrests \nand convictions, I am not convinced that he could not remember that he served jail time \nfor the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.m and underwent a lengthy period when his \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended. Likewise, I am not convinced that he did not realize that \nhe had a conviction for domestic violence when he submitted his SCA in October 2017, \nbecause he admitted at the hearing that he learned that he had a domestic violence \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nconviction in December 2015, when he was charged with failure to disclose it in his \napplication to purchase a firearm. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s omissions were recent, \nbecause they involved his current application for a clearance. They did not occur under \nunique circumstances. Even after being confronted with his omissions, he gave false and \nimplausible explanations for them, which raise doubt about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His falsifications were not minor, because \nfalsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security \nclearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant encountered several conditions \nbeyond his control. He was unemployed from July 2009 to June 2013. It is not clear from \nthe record whether he was voluntarily unemployed while attending college. However, his \nemployment from February 2012 to June 2013 was a condition beyond his control. He \ntestified that his medical bills were for emergency treatment received before his veterans\u2019 \nmedical benefits were activated. While a medical emergency would constitute a condition \nlargely beyond his control, he did not provide any details about it. Regardless of the nature \nof the emergency, he has not acted responsibly. Although he resolved one of his three \nmedical debts, he has taken no action to resolve the other two medical debts or his child-\nsupport arrearage. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n12 \n\n \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, E, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, the favorable comments of his supervisors, and his \ncommendable community involvement. His work record and community involvement \nreflect steps in the right direction to overcome his troubled past. I have also considered \nhis lack of candor in his SCA and his implausible explanations for it, which indicate that \nhe has not yet reached the point of rehabilitation. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines J, E, and F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his criminal conduct, personal conduct, and delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j and 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a- 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a, 3.b, and 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Price, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/13/2020\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 26, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On April 24, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nOn May 15, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she elected to have her \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 29, 2019, and she was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on November 5, 2019. Her response was due on December 5, 2019. Applicant \ntimely submitted a one-page statement to the FORM with four attachments which were \naccepted without objection. The case was assigned to me on January 29, 2020. The \nrecord closed on January 29, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, four of the \nSOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., and 1.i.). \nApplicant\u2019s comments with respect to both her admissions and her denials are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a material analyst with her current employer since January 2012, and before that she \nwas a material production coordinator with the same employer during two separate \nperiods essentially going back to 2003. She is a 1987 high school graduate. She has \nnever served with the U.S. military, and she has never held a security clearance. She was \nmarried in 1990, and she has four children, born in 1991, 1999, 2002, and 2004.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 7 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated June 14, 2017); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nFebruary 7, 2019); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 3, 2019); Item 3 (SF 86, \ndated January 26, 2017); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated July 10, 2018); and \nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to SOR, dated May 15, 2019).  \nApplicant reported that she was unemployed from November 2007, when she was \nlaid off, until August 2008. During that period she received unemployment compensation. \n(Item 3, at 13-14) She did not attribute her financial problems to any specific factors.  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nIn her January 2017 SF 86, Applicant listed having only one delinquent account \nwhich she claimed had arisen as a result of a motor vehicle accident in March 2015 when \nthe insurance company denied coverage. She denied having any additional \ndelinquencies. (Item 3, at 32-33)  \nIn July 2018, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant acknowledged that, in early 2015 when she \nobtained a credit report and learned that she had several other delinquent accounts, she \nstarted working with a credit counseling service. She added that she had engaged a \nparticular law firm that specializes in debt relief to negotiate payments with her creditors \nand provide her credit assistance. She contended that she pays the firm $200 every pay \nday for their services. She described her overall financial situation as \u201cbetter.\u201d She stated \nthat the majority of her delinquent accounts were in the negotiation process, some were \nbeing paid, and others had already been paid off. (Item 4)  \nThe OPM investigator offered Applicant the opportunity to furnish documentation \nregarding the accounts, and she provided 15 pages of financial documents, not otherwise \ndescribed, that were sent to \u201cdocument control\u201d on July 12, 2018. (Item 4, at 5) No such \ndocuments were included in the case file submitted to me. Accordingly, it is not known if \nthose documents included the engagement agreement with the law firm; the terms of the \ncredit counseling services or negotiation services furnished by the law firm; or cancelled \nchecks or receipts supporting payments to the law firm or to various creditors. Because \nthe OPM investigator acknowledged receiving those financial documents, and the \ngovernment failed to produce them, I have given Applicant the benefit of the doubt and \nconcluded that she had furnished documentation that was material and relevant to the \nallegations in the SOR.  \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,176, as set \nforth as follows:  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a jointly-held automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $19,208 that \nwas charged off in December 2015 and sold to another company. Applicant disputed the \naccount status with the credit reporting company. (Item 7, at 6, 10; Item 5, at 1-2; Item 6, \nat 1; Item 3, at 32-33; Item 2; Letter from collection agent, dated August 5 or 6, 2017, \nattached to Response to the FORM) Applicant acknowledged that her husband had \ncancelled his insurance coverage with one company to take advantage of lower prices \nwith another company, but he failed to comply with the requirement that the vehicle be \ninspected, and when it was involved in an accident and totaled, both insurance companies \nrejected his claim. (Item 3, at 32-33) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \nallegation, and she claimed that the creditor or collection agent had refused any \nsettlement other than a full payment on the unpaid balance. The account is not yet in the \nprocess of being resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $699 that was charged \noff and sold to another company. (Item 7, at 7; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 3) The unpaid \nbalance eventually increased to $1,133. Applicant initially claimed that she had attempted \nto pay the creditor but was unable to do so because the account had been charged off \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \ndue to a hurricane, so she never made another attempt. (Item 2) On November 29, 2019, \neight months after the SOR was issued, Applicant made a $50 payment to the collection \nagent. (Account Summary from collection agent, dated November 29, 2019, attached to \nResponse to the FORM) Applicant failed to produce any evidence that other more recent \npayments have been made. The account is in the very early process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $883 that was charged \noff. The last payment was made in March 2018. (Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 4) Although \nApplicant admitted that the account remains delinquent, she stated, without further \nexplanation, that it is \u201cunder negotiation.\u201d In the absence of documentation to support \nApplicant\u2019s characterization, the account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is a utility account with an unpaid balance of $421 that was charged \noff. The last payment was made in November 2017. (Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 6) Although \nApplicant resided in the city where the utility was located, she claimed to have no \nknowledge of the account. The account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $390 that was placed \nfor collection in 2014. (Item 7, at 10; Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 2) A payment in the amount \nof $390 was made on May 21, 2019, approximately one month after the SOR was issued. \n(Item 6, at 6; Payment List, undated, attached to Response to the FORM) The account \nhas been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $127 that was placed \nfor collection in 2018. (Item 6, at 2) A payment in the amount of $127 was made in May \n1, 2019, approximately two weeks after the SOR was issued. (Item 6, at 2; Payment List, \nundated, attached to Response to the FORM) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $1,506 that \nwas placed for collection in 2014. (Item 7, at 10) Although Applicant admitted that the \naccount remains delinquent, she stated, without further explanation, that it is \u201cunder \nnegotiation for $369.\u201d However, her reference to the unpaid balance of $369 indicates \nthat she is confusing this account with another delinquent account with the same creditor \nwith a different account number and different unpaid balance. See the information \nassociated with SOR \u00b6 1.i. The account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. is an Internet account with an unpaid balance of $647 that was placed \nfor collection in 2017. (Item 7, at 10) Applicant initially confused this account with a \nmedical account, and then noted that it was no longer on her credit report. (Item 4, at 4) \nThe account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. is a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $369 that was \nplaced for collection in 2014. (Item 7, at 10) Although Applicant admitted that the account \nremains delinquent, she stated, without further explanation, that she owes the amount \nand it is \u201cunder negotiation.\u201d The account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nOther than Applicant\u2019s unverified contentions regarding her efforts to resolve \ncertain delinquent accounts, as noted above, there is very little documentary evidence, \nsuch as repayment plans, cancelled checks, bank account registers, or receipts from \ncreditors to support that she has made any efforts to address any of her delinquent \naccounts before the SOR was issued in April 2019. In January 2020, Department Counsel \nnoted in the FORM that Applicant had not provided any documentation to support her \ncontentions in her Answer. Despite that notice, with the exception of documents related \nto three delinquent accounts, Applicant failed to furnish the appropriate documentation. \nIn the absence of such documentation, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s other delinquent \naccounts have not yet entered the process of being resolved. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s contention in February 2018 that her overall financial situation \nwas \u201cbetter,\u201d it is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because \nshe did not report her current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly \nremainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no \nevidence of a budget. There is no documentary evidence of financial counseling. In the \nabsence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than she had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,176. \nSeveral of those debts became delinquent as early as 2014, and until after the SOR was \nissued, none of them were addressed by Applicant. Although she initially claimed that she \nwas unaware of any debts other the delinquent automobile loan, she subsequently \nacknowledged that she became aware of her other delinquent debts when she reviewed \na credit report in 2015. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no \nevidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy her debts regardless of an ability to \ndo so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) minimally apply, but none of the other conditions apply. \nThroughout the security clearance review process, Applicant merely inferred, without \nspecifically stating, that she had financial difficulties that motivated her to seek financial \ncounseling. She clearly identified a problem arising from the vehicle that was not covered \nby insurance, but generally claimed that she was unaware that other accounts were \ndelinquent. As noted above, several of those debts became delinquent as early as 2014, \nand until after the SOR was issued, none of them were addressed by Applicant. A debt \nthat became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).  \n \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, \nand her failure to voluntarily and timely resolve her delinquent accounts for several years, \nmake it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain \nunchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant completed her SF 86 in \nJanuary 2017; underwent her OPM interview in July 2018; and the SOR was issued in \nApril 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process placed her on notice of \nthe significance of the financial issues confronting her. She has produced evidence that \ntwo of the medical accounts (with balances of $390 and $127) had been resolved in May \n2019; that she had recently made a $50 payment on another account in November 2019; \nand some of the accounts were \u201cin negotiation.\u201d However, the remaining delinquent debts \nare not yet in the process of being addressed other than through unspecified \n\u201cnegotiations.\u201d \n \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant intentionally chose to ignore her \ndelinquent accounts even after she was interviewed by OPM. An applicant who begins to \nresolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security \nclearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules \nand regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. \n(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-\n00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018).  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nWith respect to financial counseling or a budget, Applicant provided 15 pages of \nfinancial documents, not otherwise described, to the OPM investigator, but those \ndocuments were not included in the case file submitted to me. While it is not known if \nthose documents included the engagement agreement with the law firm; the terms of the \ncredit counseling services or negotiation services furnished by the law firm; or some other \nmaterials associated with her financial problems, because the OPM investigator \nacknowledged receiving those financial documents, and the government failed to produce \nthem, I have given Applicant the benefit of the doubt and concluded that she had furnished \ndocumentation that was material and relevant to the allegations in the SOR. Although it \nremains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than \nshe had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \nmaterial analyst with her current employer since January 2012, and before that she was \na material production coordinator with the same employer during two separate periods \nessentially going back to 2003. She is a 1987 high school graduate. She produced \nevidence that two medical accounts had been resolved in May 2019, and that she had \nrecently made a $50 payment on another account in November 2019.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has nine delinquent accounts totaling \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \napproximately $24,176. Several of those debts became delinquent as early as 2014, and \nuntil after the SOR was issued, none of them were addressed by Applicant. Although she \ninitially claimed that she was unaware of any debts other the delinquent automobile loan, \nshe subsequently acknowledged that she became aware of her other delinquent debts \nwhen she reviewed a credit report in 2015. Of the nine accounts alleged in the SOR, she \nmade relatively modest payments of $390 and $127 to resolve two delinquent medical \naccounts in May 2019, and she made a $50 payment on another account in November \n2019. She claimed that other delinquent accounts were \u201cin negotiation,\u201d but that \nnegotiation process was never explained and has apparently produced no results. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best, seemingly delaying any meaningful \nresolution efforts until after the SOR was issued. Overall, the evidence leaves me with \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e. and 1.f.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g. through 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

M. Apostol, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/23/2020\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 27, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On April 26, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated May 15, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1)  A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 16, 2019, and \nhe was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM on July 19, 2019. His response was due on August \n18, 2019. Applicant timely responded to the FORM and submitted a response and several \ndocuments attached to it. Those materials were admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on September 6, 2019. However, it was later determined that Applicant \nhad separated from employment on August 29, 2019, and as DOHA had lost jurisdiction \nbecause of his separation, the case file was closed and returned. Applicant eventually \nobtained new employment (and a sponsor), so the matter was reopened on January 13, \n2020. The case was reassigned to me on January 16, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, sometimes with brief comments, \nnearly all of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. \nthrough 1.h., and 1.i.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and \nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. It is unclear what his \ncurrent position is. He had been serving as a welder with his former employer from \nJanuary 2018 until August 2019. He also previously served in similar full-time or part-time \npositions with other employers from December 2014 until January 2018. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Navy Reserve (Inactive) in July 2000, and he served until he was honorably \ndischarged in January 2012. He is a 2000 high school graduate. He attended one college \nfor ten months and received a certification as a pharmacy technician in 2013, and he \nattended another university at several locations around the country for over two years, \nbut has not received a degree. He has never held a security clearance. He was married \nin 2011, and divorced in 2013. He has been cohabiting since 2015. He has three children, \nborn in 2004, 2016, and 2017.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated April 11, 2018); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated March \n18, 2019); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated November 2, 2018); Item 2 (SF 86), \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ndated February 27, 2018); Item 1 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated May 15, 2019); and \nResponse to the FORM, undated).  \nApplicant noted that he was unemployed from February 2012 until April 2013 while \nhe was attending college; from July 2013 until April 2014, after he quit a job because he \nwas enrolled in college and could not balance both the school and work hours required, \nand he relocated from one state to another. He was also unemployed from February 2017 \nuntil June 2017, after he resigned in anticipation of a furlough. (Item 2, at 16-17, 20-21) \nWhile he did not attribute his financial problems to any factors other than having \ninsufficient funds, he did mention that he had been irresponsible. (Item 5, at 6)  \nOn November 2, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). During the interview, he claimed that after \nFebruary 2018, he had engaged the professional services of a particular national law firm \nto assist him in resolving his delinquent debts by negotiating reduced balances for \npotential settlement, and removing certain accounts from his credit report. He said that \nhe was paying that firm $129 per month to fulfill its obligations.  He also stated that he \nhas received financial counseling and debt consolidation services, but he failed to identify \nby whom those services were being provided, and when those services took place. (Item \n5, at 4-6) Applicant failed to submit any documentation regarding the reported \nprofessional relationship with the national law firm, or to confirm any of the reported \nactivities that may have been taken on his behalf. \nThe SOR alleged a failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return, as well \nas ten delinquent accounts totaling nearly $31,500, as set forth as follows:  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is an automobile insurance account with an unpaid balance of $302 \nthat was placed for collection in 2016. (Item 3, at 8; Item 5, at 6) During his OPM interview, \nApplicant claimed he had paid it off in April 2018. (Item 5, at 6) However, in his Answer \nto the SOR, he claimed the account was paid in full as of March 2018. (Item 1, at 4) One \nof the attachments to his Response to the FORM is a letter from the collection agent for \nthe creditor, dated August 2, 2019, attesting to the fact that the account has been paid in \nfull. The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $3,370 that \nwas charged off and placed of collection in 2010, and eventually purchased by another \nlender. (Item 3, at 8) Neither Applicant nor his national law firm had any knowledge about \nthe account, and it is no longer listed in his 2019 credit report. (Item 5, at 6; Item 1, at 4) \nThe account remains unresolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a charge account with a furniture store with an unpaid balance of \n$610 that was charged off and placed for collection in 2010. (Item 3, at 9; Item 5, at 6) \nApplicant admitted the allegation, but subsequently submitted a document from the \ncreditor entitled \u201ccredit card payment arrangements,\u201d dated August 13, 2019, calling for \npayments of $329 to commence on September 5, 2019, and continue each month \nthereafter until the unpaid balance, by August 2019, increased to nearly $1,302, is paid \nin full. (Letter, dated August 13, 2019, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nDuring the ensuing five months, Applicant failed to submit any documentation, such as a \ncancelled check, a bank register, a credit card statement, or a receipt from the creditor to \nconfirm that he has been in compliance with those arrangements. In the absence of such \ndocumentation, it is impossible to determine if Applicant is yet in the process of resolving \nthe account. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is a medical account from the emergency room at a local hospital with \nan unpaid balance of $518 that was placed for collection in 2016. (Item 3, at 9; Item 5, at \n6) During his OPM interview, Applicant acknowledged that the account had not yet been \nresolved and that his national law firm was negotiating with the creditor. In his Answer to \nthe SOR, he admitted the allegation, but noted that there was a repayment arrangement \nunder which Applicant would pay the creditor $100 starting June 1, 2019, and the account \nwould be paid in full by the end of that month. (Item 1, at 4) Things apparently changed, \nfor Applicant subsequently submitted a receipt for $120 that was paid on August 2, 2019, \nsupposedly leaving an unpaid balance of $190. (Receipt, dated August 2, 2019, attached \nto Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) Applicant failed to explain the changes in the \nrepayment arrangements, and with the exception of the receipt for $120, he failed to \nsubmit any documentation, such as a cancelled check, a bank register, a credit card \nstatement, or a receipt from the creditor to confirm that he has been in compliance with \nthose revised arrangements. Nevertheless, at appears that the account is in the process \nof being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is a gymnasium or fitness center account with an unpaid balance of \n$624 that was placed for collection in 2013. (Item 3, at 10; Item 5, at 6) In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted the allegation, but noted that there was a repayment arrangement \nunder which Applicant would pay the creditor a total of approximately $312, split into two \npayments starting June 7, 2019, and the account would be paid in full by the end of that \nmonth. (Item 1, at 4) Applicant subsequently submitted a receipt, dated August 2, 2019, \nwhich stated that the account is now \u201csettled in full.\u201d (Receipt, dated August 2, 2019, \nattached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. is an automobile loan that Applicant co-signed for a friend with an \nunpaid balance of $12,801 that was placed for collection in 2013. (Item 3, at 10; Item 5, \nat 6) Applicant admitted the allegation, but noted that his co-signer \u2013 the primary debtor \n\u2013 on the loan has already commenced payment arrangements as of February 2018. (Item \n1, at 4) Applicant failed to submit any documentation, such as a copy of the repayment \narrangements, cancelled checks, a bank register, credit card statements, a statement \nfrom the co-signer, or receipts from the creditor to confirm that one or both co-signers \nhave been in compliance with those arrangements. In the absence of such \ndocumentation, it is impossible to determine if the account is yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a telephone account with an unpaid balance of $987 that was placed \nfor collection in 2018. (Item 3, at 10; Item 5, at 5) Applicant initially claimed that the issue \nfirst arose in 2015, but admitted the allegation, and indicated that the national law firm \nwas trying to negotiate a potential settlement amount. (Item 5, at 5; Item 1, at 4) In his \nResponse to the FORM, Applicant stated that the collection agent advised him that the \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \naccount had been taken from them and forwarded to another collection agency, and that \nthe creditor was unable to furnish him information regarding the new collection agent, or \ngive him a written note of their conversation. Applicant failed to submit any \ndocumentation, including reports from the national law firm, or correspondence from him \nor the national law firm to the creditor or collection agent, or back to them. The account \nis not yet in the process of being resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. is a school loan or grant with an unpaid balance of $3,018 that was \ncharged off in 2013 for which Applicant was responsible when he failed to finish college. \n(Item 3, at 11; Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 5) He admitted the allegation, and he acknowledged \nthat the account remains unresolved. (Item 1, at 4; Response to the FORM) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. is a child support indebtedness or arrearage with an unpaid balance of \n$605. He was delinquent in his payments in April, May, and June 2018. (Item 3, at 11; \nItem 4, at 2; Item 5, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation and \nclaimed that the account has been in good standing and current as of April 2018. (Item 1, \nat 4) His current monthly support obligation is $521. As of July 29, 2019, his balance to \nthe payee \u2013 the mother of his first child \u2013 is zero. (Case Summary Information, dated July \n29, 2019, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) The account has been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j. is an automobile loan on a vehicle worth approximately $26,867 that \nwas repossessed in 2016 leaving an unpaid balance of $8,576 that was charged off. (Item \n3, at 11; Item 4, at 1; Item 5, at 4) He admitted the allegation, and he acknowledged that \nthe account remains unresolved. (Item 1, at 4; Response to the FORM) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. refers to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax \nreturn. (Item 5, at 4) Applicant denied the allegation, claiming that he had filed his tax \nreturn in December 2018, and that he was making monthly $200 payments to the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS).  (Item 1, at 4) He failed to submit documentation, such as an IRS \naccount transcript or a copy of his income tax return to indicate the date when the income \ntax return was actually filed. Although he discussed with the OPM investigator his failure \nto timely file the income tax return because he didn\u2019t have his W-2s; reported that he \nowed the IRS approximately $9,000 in unpaid taxes; and that he intended to consult with \na tax relief representative in the near future, the SOR did not allege those unpaid taxes, \nand that fact is considered unalleged conduct. (Item 5, at 4) Applicant submitted an extract \nof his Installment Agreement with the IRS as part of his Response to the FORM, and \nwhile it does not expressly state when the federal income tax return was filed, it does refer \nto an unpaid balance of nearly $8,933, including over $1,255 in interest and penalties as \nof July 10, 2019, and a $200 payment having been made on June 17, 2019. (Installment \nAgreement, dated July 10, 2019, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM)  \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he owed federal income \ntaxes. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed \nfive circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApril 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unpaid federal income \ntaxes, associated with his failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return, will not \nbe considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling other than Applicant unverified \ncomments referring to it. In the absence of additional financial information, it remains \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return, and he had ten \ndelinquent accounts totaling nearly $31,500. He claimed that his failure to timely file the \nfederal income tax return was because he didn\u2019t have his W-2s, and he had insufficient \nfunds to maintain his accounts in a current status. As of the date the SOR was issued, \nwith the possible exception of returning his child support arrearage back up to zero, he \nhad not resolved any of those delinquent accounts, and he failed to provide documentary \nproof regarding the date he finally filed his federal income tax return. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), \nand 19(f) have been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been \nunwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not \nbeen established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, as well as his failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return, cause \nme to conclude that his financial problems were not infrequent and they are likely to \ncontinue in the future. While he did not attribute his financial problems to any factors other \nthan having insufficient funds, he did mention that he had been irresponsible.  \nDuring his OPM interview, Applicant claimed that after February 2018, he had \nengaged the professional services of a particular national law firm to assist him in \nresolving his delinquent debts by negotiating reduced balances for potential settlement, \nand removing certain accounts from his credit report. He also stated that he has received \nfinancial counseling and debt consolidation services, but he failed to identify by whom \nthose services were being provided, and when those services took place. Applicant failed \nto submit any documentation regarding those reported professional relationships, or to \nconfirm any of the reported activities that may have been taken on his behalf. \nAs noted above, the first document\u2013supported activity between Applicant and a \ncreditor took place on or about June 1\u20137, 2019, and actual document\u2013supported \npayments to creditors were scheduled to occur on June 1, 2019, June 7, 2019, and \nAugust 2, 2019, with anticipated payments to one creditor scheduled to commence on \nSeptember 5, 2019. An applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after \nbeing placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in \nthe judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is \nno immediate threat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). In \nthis instance, Applicant completed his SF 86 in February 2018; underwent his OPM \ninterview in November 2018; and the SOR was issued in April 2019. Each step of the \nsecurity clearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the financial \nissues confronting him. There is no verified evidence that Applicant took any steps to \nengage his various creditors before the SOR was issued. With respect to his unfiled 2016 \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nfederal income tax return, there is no evidence that Applicant took any action to contact \nthe IRS until well after that tax return was required to be filed. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)). In this instance, there is no evidence, supported by documentation, that \nApplicant took any good-faith corrective actions with respect to his delinquent debts \nbefore the SOR was issued. There are some unverified comments by Applicant that he \nstarted to resolve some delinquent accounts before the SOR was issued, but he offered \nno documentation to support his contentions. His contentions regarding the status of \nsome accounts, and his unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions, \nwithout documents, to support his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith actions. The \nAppeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Although it is unclear what \nhis current position is, he had been serving as a welder with his former employer from \nJanuary 2018 until August 2019. He also previously served in similar full-time or part-time \npositions with other employers from December 2014 until January 2018. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Navy Reserve (Inactive) in July 2000, and he served until he was honorably \ndischarged in January 2012. He is a 2000 high school graduate. He attended one college \nfor ten months and received a certification as a pharmacy technician in 2013, and he \nattended another university at several locations around the country for over two years, \nbut has not received a degree. Applicant finally addressed some of his creditors, made \nsome minimum payments, and filed his 2016 federal income tax return. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. In addition to his failure to timely file his 2016 federal income \ntax return, Applicant had ten delinquent accounts totaling nearly $31,500, as alleged in \nthe SOR. Moreover, although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also owed the IRS \napproximately $9,000 in unpaid taxes associated with that tax year. As of the date the \nSOR was issued, he had not resolved any of those delinquent accounts, and he failed to \nprovide documentary proof regarding the date he finally filed his federal income tax return.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nAside from Applicant\u2019s unverified claims regarding his delinquent debts and his \nfailure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return, there is very little documentary \nevidence to indicate that Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts have been addressed. \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me with \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
