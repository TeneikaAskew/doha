The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant submitted an undated answer to the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on March 24, \n2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non March 25, 2021, scheduling the hearing for May 4, 2021. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which were \nadmitted into evidence.

He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since March of 2019. (AppX 1 at pages 7 and 12.) \nHe is unmarried, and has no children. (GX 1 at page 18.)

(TR at page 18 line 10 to page 19 line 13, and at page 30 lines 16~19.) \n \n1.b. It is alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2014~2018. He has submitted documentation showing he has filed for tax years \n2015, 2017 and 2018. (TR at page 19 line 21 to page 23 line 8, at page 24 line 1 to \npage 26 line 11, and AppXs A~C.)

Applicant admits that he owes $6,453 (AppX E) to the Federal Government \nin delinquent taxes. (TR at page 23 lines 9~19, and at page 26 line 12 to page 27 line \n22.) Despite having two additional months to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing \nregarding this Federal tax delinquency. (TR at page 31 lines 18~23.) \n \n1.e. As Applicant has submitted documentation (AppX E) showing he is due a \n$12,771 refund from his state, I find no $5,277 state tax delinquency. (TR at page 23 \nline 20 to page 27 line 22.)

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has delinquent Federal and state income tax filings, and owes \nsignificant monies to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s delinquent income tax filings are ongoing. He also \nstill owes the IRS a significant amount of monies (he owes nothing to his state). He has \nnot demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 \nhas not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the five student loans referred for collection (in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.i, and 1.o). Applicant denied the remaining 13 delinquent medical accounts, claiming that these debts had been discharged through bankruptcy. Her admissions are accepted as a finding of fact. Applicant is 30 years old. She served in the Army National Guard from January 2009 until January 2015, at which time she received an honorable discharge. During her service, she held a DOD security clearance. In April 2016, she earned an associate\u2019s degree. She currently resides with a cohabitant and her daughter, age 6. She is employed as a massage therapist earning about $2,500 a month. She has been offered a position with a DOD contractor as an imagery analyst, but her employment is contingent upon her obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 19-20, 29, 37-38; GE 1) Financial Considerations Applicant attributed her financial delinquencies to various medical issues and an unexpected hospitalization while without medical insurance. In January 2015, she suffered from a gallbladder attack while drilling for the Army National Guard. She was taken to the hospital and her gallbladder was removed. Although she believed she was covered by Tricare insurance, she later discovered that her Tricare medical coverage was denied. She did not challenge the Tricare denial of coverage and she was held personally 2 responsible for the medical debt totaling approximately $36,0",

She served in the Army National Guard from January \n2009 until January 2015, at which time she received an honorable discharge. During her \nservice, she held a DOD security clearance. In April 2016, she earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree. She currently resides with a cohabitant and her daughter, age 6. She is employed \nas a massage therapist earning about $2,500 a month. She has been offered a position \nwith a DOD contractor as an imagery analyst, but her employment is contingent upon her \nobtaining a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 19-20, 29, 37-38; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant attributed her financial delinquencies to various medical issues and an \nunexpected hospitalization while without medical insurance. In January 2015, she \nsuffered from a gallbladder attack while drilling for the Army National Guard. She was \ntaken to the hospital and her gallbladder was removed. Although she believed she was \ncovered by Tricare insurance, she later discovered that her Tricare medical coverage was \ndenied. She did not challenge the Tricare denial of coverage and she was held personally \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for the medical debt totaling approximately $36,000.

In \nNovember 2020, a lawsuit was filed against her to recover the $36,000 in unpaid medical \nexpenses related to her gallbladder surgery. Shortly thereafter, Applicant filed for Chapter \n7 bankruptcy protection, listing approximately $50,000 in medical debt and $13,000 in \ndelinquent student loans. Her March 2021 bankruptcy discharge included all of her \nmedical debt. Her student loans are currently in forbearance until September 2021, due \nto the Covid-19 pandemic. Applicant testified that her car loan will be paid in full in \nSeptember 2021, and it is her intention to use the extra $260 to start paying on her student \nloans thereafter. (Tr. 12, 21-23, 25, 28, 38-41; AE A, AE B) \nApplicant completed the financial counseling required by her bankruptcy filing in \nDecember 2020. She learned from the counseling that she needed to monitor her \nspending habits and create a practical monthly budget. She is in the process of rebuilding \nher savings account. The father of her daughter provides $400 in monthly support. She \nhas filed all Federal and state income tax returns. (Tr. 30-31, 35-37) \nApplicant provided three character reference letters from friends, who described \nher as dedicated, trustworthy, and a person of integrity. Her friends assert that she would \nbe a valuable asset to any organization or employer. (AE C, AE D, AE E) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s five delinquent student loans and 13 \ndelinquent medical accounts prompted her to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThree financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from periods of underemployment and \nunexpected serious medical issues that required medical treatment without the benefit of \nmedical insurance. These circumstances are largely beyond her control. It is important to \nnote that the SOR debts did not include unpaid consumer accounts due to Applicant living \nbeyond her means. She is a military service member and suffered from a gallbladder \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA fundamental goal of the federal bankruptcy laws enacted by Congress is \nto give debtors a financial \u201cfresh start\u201d from burdensome debts. The \nSupreme Court made this point about the purpose of the bankruptcy law in \na 1934 decision: \u201c[I]t gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor \u2026 a new \nopportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the \npressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.\u201d Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934). This goal is accomplished through the bankruptcy \ndischarge, which releases debtors from personal liability from specific debts \nand prohibits creditors from ever taking any action against the debtor to \ncollect those debts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nattack while on a weekend drill. Applicant sought legal advice due to a pending lawsuit \nand overwhelming medical debt. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney recommended that she \nseek a fresh financial start by filing Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Resolution of debts through \nbankruptcy is a legally authorized means for resolving delinquent debt. The U.S. \nBankruptcy Court website states: \nIn March 2021, the bankruptcy court discharged Applicant\u2019s nonpriority unsecured \ndebts, which included all of her delinquent medical accounts alleged in the SOR. The five \nstudent loans are currently in forbearance until September 2021. It is her intention to start \npaying on her student loans in October 2021 after she makes her last car payment in \nSeptember 2021. All of the delinquent medical accounts alleged in the SOR are resolved \nand there are clear indications that her finances are under control. Applicant has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, and future financial problems are unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) are established, and financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \n \n \n \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old massage therapist with an employment offer from a DOD \ncontractor that is contingent on her obtaining a DOD security clearance. Her unforeseen \nmedical issues and periods of underemployment are circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol that adversely affected her finances. Resolution of debts through bankruptcy is a \nlegally authorized means for resolving delinquent debt. In March 2021, the bankruptcy \ncourt discharged all of her delinquent nonpriority unsecured debts under Chapter 7 of the \nBankruptcy Code. \nApplicant took affirmative action to resolve her financial delinquencies and her \nfinancial issues are currently under control. Her conduct shows financial responsibility \nand good judgment. I find that future delinquencies are unlikely to recur. After evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.s: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C.

Applicant admits that in August of 1994, he was arrested for \nand found guilty, in part, of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). He was \nsentenced to four days in jail and fined $1,500. [Listed chronologically below.] \nApplicant admits that about four years later, in April of 1998, he was arrested for \nand found guilty, in part, of DUI, and of Driving on a Suspended License. He was \nsentenced to four days in jail and fined $1,760. \nApplicant admits that about two years later, in August of 2000, he was arrested \nfor Disorderly Conduct, Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs. Applicant avers that these \ncharges were dropped, and nothing further is alleged. \nApplicant admits that less than a year later, in May and July of 2001, he was \narrested for and found guilty, in part, of DUI, and of Driving on a Suspended License. \nHe was sentenced to 60 days in jail, 45 days of home detention, and fined $1,250. \nApplicant admits that about eight years later, in July and October of 2009, he was \narrested for and found guilty of a fourth DUI. He was sentenced to four days in jail, and \nfined $2,000. \nApplicant admits that about eight years later, in January of 2017, he was \narrested, in part, for a fifth DUI, for having an Expired Registration, and for Violation of \nLicense Restrictions. He was fined, ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings, and to provide proof of a valid license and registration. (Item 5.) \nApplicant admits that about two years later, in March of 2019, he was arrested for \nand found guilty of a sixth DUI.

Applicant avers that these charges were dropped, and \nnothing further is alleged. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Five conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional\n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical\nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has __ alcohol-related incidents between __ and __. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant was convicted of _____ offenses. He was on probation for three years \nafter his first conviction in October 2010. On June 15, 2017, he was placed on probation \nuntil June 14, 2018. His driver\u2019s license was restricted after his first conviction and \nsuspended for six months after his second conviction. The evidence establishes the \nabove three disqualifying conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s ___, given the fact that he was \npreviously convicted of two DUIs. Within the past month, he was convicted of a third \nDUI and placed on probation for one year. Although he provided evidence of successful \nwork with his employer, that evidence does not outweigh the fact that he is now on \nprobation. The evidence does not establish mitigation under either of the above \nconditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old and has worked for a DoD contractor as a software delivery manager since 1997. He has held a security clearance for about 15 years. He graduated from high school in 1979. He then received a certificate in technology from a trade school. He married in 1986, and has four adult children, ages 20 to 32. He has owned his home since 1999. (Tr. at 29, 38-41.)

In May 2018, they realized they needed to be more fiscally responsible and actively manage their debts. They were able to pay their credit- card debts, but they could not reduce their balances by paying every month. He was using cash from the sale of investments to pay his credit cards.

(Tr. at 73.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 60 years old and has worked for a DoD contractor as a software \ndelivery manager since 1997. He has held a security clearance for about 15 years. He \ngraduated from high school in 1979. He then received a certificate in technology from a \ntrade school. He married in 1986, and has four adult children, ages 20 to 32. He has \nowned his home since 1999. (Tr. at 29, 38-41.) \nApplicant and his wife incurred a significant amount of debt over a number of years. \nHe and his wife had overspent on non-essential assets, which he purchased with \nborrowed money or credit cards. In May 2018, they realized they needed to be more \nfiscally responsible and actively manage their debts. They were able to pay their credit-\ncard debts, but they could not reduce their balances by paying every month. He was using \ncash from the sale of investments to pay his credit cards. Also, Applicant\u2019s second oldest \nson and his youngest daughter lived at home. Then his oldest son and his wife and their \nchildren moved back into the family home. Applicant\u2019s family situation imposed significant \nnew financial obligations on Applicant. (Tr. at 15-16, 18, 28-38; GE 2 at 2.) \nIn May 2018, Applicant hired a credit-counseling company to help him manage \nthe debt. The advisor instructed Applicant to close all of his credit-card accounts and to \nstop paying the accounts as the first step to negotiate settlements.

As noted below, six of the debts were \nunpaid at that time. He has the funds to pay these debts. He has a net monthly remainder \nof about $1,500.

(Tr. at 35, 83; AE \nR.) \nSOR Allegations \nParagraph 1, Guideline F - The SOR sets forth seven allegations regarding \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid consumer debts. In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the \nallegations. The details regarding each of the delinquent debts are as follows: \n1.a Account charged off in the approximate amount of $4,706 \u2013 On the advice \nof his first advisor, Applicant stopped paying this credit-card account in May 2018. After \nthe hearing, Applicant entered into a settlement agreement under which he would pay \n$1,883 in full settlement of this debt. He provided a copy of that agreement and proof of \npayment on September 7, 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 42-44; GE 3 at 5; GE 6 at \n12; AE DD; AE EE.) \n1.b Account charged off in the approximate amount of $2,601 \u2013 On the advice \nof his first advisor, Applicant stopped paying this credit-card account in May 2018. After \nthe hearing, Applicant entered into a settlement agreement under which he would pay \n$825 in full settlement of this debt. He provided a copy of that agreement and proof of \npayment on September 7, 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 44-46; GE 3 at 5; GE 6 at \n12; AE FF; AE EE.) \n1.c Account charged off in the approximate amount of $17,393 \u2013 The \nGovernment\u2019s most recent credit report reflects that this credit-card account was paid in \nJanuary 2021, and the account was closed. Applicant provided several documents \nconfirming that this debt was resolved in January 2021 prior to the issuance of the SOR. \nHe resolved this debt without the assistance of either of his two advisors by paying the \ncreditor\u2019s collection agency $7,827. The final payment was on January 11, 2021. This \ndebt is resolved.

He testified that \nhe has recently asked the Firm to negotiate a settlement of this account. As of the hearing \ndate, he had not made any payments on this debt. After the hearing, Applicant provided \na letter from the Firm, dated September 7, 2021, stating that it has presented to the \ncreditor\u2019s collection agency Applicant\u2019s allegation that the creditor may have committed a \nviolation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. The letter advised that the Firm is \nwaiting for a response \u201con a resolution of the matter.\u201d This letter seems inconsistent with \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he asked the Firm to negotiate a settlement. In a separate letter \nfrom the Firm, dated May 6, 2021, Applicant\u2019s attorney advised that the Firm has been \nrepresenting Applicant with respect to this debt and others listed in the SOR since \nSeptember 2018. After three years of inactivity in resolving this debt, the  Firm is only now \nseeking to dispute this debt under an unspecified legal theory. As of the close of the \nrecord, Applicant was waiting for the creditor to respond. He also wrote that he has made \n\u201cefforts to pay off [the] debt since August 9th  hearing.\u201d This debt is not resolved. It has \nalso been disputed.

He provided evidence of the sale of certain \nassets and the payment of collateralized loans to reduce his expenses.

With his post-hearing submission, he provided a summary page in \nwhich he made the statement that he continues to receive credit counseling from the \nattorneys at the Firm and has not made any large purchases or incurred any new credit \ncard debt. (Tr. at 16; AE J; AE N-S; AE X.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports listing seven delinquent debts establish the \nfollowing conditions under AG \u00b6 19 that could be disqualifying: \n(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Five of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous and recent. \nApplicant incurred extensive credit-card debt during a period when he was earning a \nsubstantial income. On the advice of his attorney at the Firm, he deliberately took no \nactions to resolve the debts alleged in the SOR while he waited for the applicable statutes \nof limitations to run to avoid paying the debts. He has not taken any actions to resolve \nthree of the debts alleged in the SOR. On a fourth debt, he waited three years before \ndeciding just prior to his hearing that he wanted his attorneys to begin negotiations to \nresolve that debt while at the same time disputing it. Applicant\u2019s behavior casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts arose due to his overspending on \nhis numerous credit cards, which was completely under his control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is only partially established. Applicant sought credit counseling to help \nresolve his credit-card debt. However, he did not address his debt in a responsible or \ntimely manner. He has been successful in resolving three of the seven debts alleged in \nthe SOR and certain other non-alleged debts.

Applicant has four remaining credit-card debts that are \nunresolved. There are no clear indications that these substantial liabilities are being \nresolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially established. Applicant paid one of the SOR debts prior \nto the issuance of the SOR. He paid two of the remaining six debts after the hearing. The \ntiming of this effort somewhat undercuts the mitigation value of the resolutions of these \ndebts as being made in good faith. He has not otherwise entered into a good-faith effort \nto repay the four remaining debts listed in the SOR. \nAs explained to Applicant at the hearing, his reliance upon the expiration of the \nstatute of limitations making certain debts legally unenforceable is not viewed as a good-\nfaith effort to resolve those debts for purposes of a security clearance adjudication under \nthe Directive. See ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) (Reliance upon \na statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties \nand is of limited mitigation value.) The DOHA Appeal Board has held this position for \nmany years. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005) (Although \nan applicant legally may rely on the running of a statute of limitation to avoid paying debts, \nsuch reliance does not, by itself, constitute a good-faith effort to resolve debts within the \nmeaning of the Directive.) \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has disputed one debt (1.g) on a vague \nassertion by his legal advisor that Applicant\u2019s legal rights under one or more Federal \nstatutes or regulations may have been violated. While Applicant documented this \nassertion of his rights, he did not provide any documents establishing a reasonable basis \nof the dispute. \nApplicant has twice submitted a letter from the Firm, in which his lawyer argued \nthat Applicant\u2019s assertion of his legal rights as a debtor under Federal law should not be \nheld against him in connection with an evaluation of his creditworthiness. Applicant\u2019s \nsubmission of this letter with his Answer and again after the hearing suggests that his \nattorney is also arguing that in connection with Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthe Federal Government cannot consider Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts that he is disputing as \nunenforceable. Assuming arguendo that Applicant is relying on this argument with regard \nto his unpaid credit-card debts, his argument is misplaced. DoD is not assessing \nApplicant\u2019s creditworthiness, nor is it looking to extend credit to Applicant. In this \nproceeding, DoD is adjudicating Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment \nunder the Directive\u2019s adjudicative guidelines promulgated for the sole purpose of \ndetermining Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional comments are warranted. \nApplicant is a mature, well-compensated manager of a major U.S. defense contractor. He \nexercised poor judgment through excessive spending using multiple credit cards. His poor \njudgment continued by his reliance on his counselor\u2019s advice to stop paying his credit \ncards when he could have continued to pay them and seek to negotiate settlements of all \nof his debts over time. Instead, he waited for time to elapse and render some of his debts \nunenforceable under applicable state statutes of limitations. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.g \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

He \nhas a high school diploma and some college. He is employed by a defense contractor \nas a Senior CAD Designer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant incurred a number of delinquent debts owed to \nthe Department of Education for student loans, and consumer debts that were either \npast due, charged off or placed for collection totaling approximately $58,000. In his \nanswer, Applicant admits each of the delinquencies. Credit reports of the Applicant \ndated October 24, 2019; and March 22, 2021, confirm this indebtedness. (Government \nExhibits 5 and 6.)  Applicant has never applied for a security clearance before. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in August 2019.  Since then,\nthere have been no noted interruptions in his employment.  Prior to his current\nemployment, Applicant experienced multiple periods of unemployed from March 2019-\nAugust 2019; October 2017- February 2018; and February 2015-March 2015 that he\nstates attributed to his current financial problems.  Applicant explained that at certain\ntimes over the years, he has had to make the difficult decision of either paying off his\ncreditors, or keeping a roof over his family\u2019s head and food on the table.  When faced\nwith this decision, he has always puts his family first.  Applicant stated that he took out a\nnumber of student loans to further his education.  He had hoped to complete a college\nengineering program that he enrolled in.  However, because he needed to work full time\nto support his family, he could not complete the program.  In addition, he was laid off\nfrom work a number of times, through no fault of his own.  When this happened, he\ndefaulted on his student loan payments and has been unable to get back on track.  At\nsome point he also separated from his wife for a two year period, and this caused\nadditional financial hardship.  He and his wife have since reconciled their relationship\nand things have improved since he now has stable employment.  Applicant states that\nhe plans to enter into a payment plan for the student loans, and he also plans on\nresolving the other outstanding consumer debts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts are delinquent and of security concern: \n1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., and 1.r.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has not paid. At this time \nthere is insufficient information in the record to conclude that he is financially stable, or \nthat he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the financial resources available to handle \nhis financial obligations. There is no evidence in the record to show that any regular \nmonthly payments of any sort are being made toward his debts. In fact, they all remain \noutstanding. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThere is some evidence in the record to show that circumstances beyond the \nApplicant\u2019s control contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. There were multiple \nperiods of unemployment, underemployment, and his separation from his wife. \nHowever, since August 2019, when he started working for his current employer he has \ndone nothing to show that he has addressed any of his delinquent debts. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. This guideline is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a while, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to copy with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but it not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s extensive criminal history coupled with his failure to answer the \nquestions about his police record accurately shows a pattern of irresponsible and \nunreliable conduct. Applicant not only failed to list his most recent arrests and charges \nthat occurred within the last seven years from the date he completed the application, but \nhe failed to read on to answer the questions accurately that ask him if he has EVER \nbeen charged with a Felony or charged with a drug or alcohol violation. Applicant\u2019s \ncarelessness or dishonesty shows poor judgment and unreliability. Applicant knew or \nshould have known to answer the questions on his application carefully and accurately. \nDeliberately concealing material information from the government on a security \nclearance \napplication \nraises \nserious \nquestions \nabout \none\u2019s \ncredibility \nand \ntrustworthiness. Carelessness shows immaturity and irresponsibility. In either case, \nnone of the mitigating conditions are applicable and Applicant does not meet the \neligibility requirement to access classified information. This guideline is found against \nthe Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not submit a \nresponse to the FORM.  Insufficient mitigation has been shown. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security \nconcerns. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.x. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. through 2.q. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on October 21, 2021. The \nhearing was held as scheduled on December 13, 2021. On December 15, 2021, I \nproposed that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition (SD) in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. Department Counsel did not object. \nThis case involves financial concerns under Guideline F. I believe a SD is \nappropriate in this case because Applicant presented credible evidence showing that \nhis debts were due in large part to his serving his country on 14 combat deployments \nduring his 20 years of service.

As a result, he incurred some credit-card debt to \nmake ends meet. He realizes this was a mistake. Once he retired in 2019, he gained \nemployment with a defense contractor, qualified for 100% VA disability payments, and \nstarted receiving his military retired pay. Needless to say, he is in a far better financial \nsituation now than he was when he was on active duty. He has paid two of the SOR \ndebts and has existing payment plans (documented with several months' worth of prior \npayments) in place for the two remaining debts. Based upon the foregoing, he mitigated \nthe financial consideration concerns. \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubts \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted six of the SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g), and denied one allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 25 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since March 2019. He had a period of unemployment from February 2018 to March 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 2014 to 2017, and was honorably discharged. He received his high school diploma in 2013 and he has since taken some college courses. He married in 2014 and has two children. (Item 4; AE B) The seven delinquent SOR debts total approximately $36,000. The debts are comprised of collection accounts and charged-off accounts (auto repossession, credit card, consumer debt, and medical debts).

The DCSA acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \neffective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nOn January 21, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

The evidence \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 4-7 (Items 1-3 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on April 20, \n2021. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted a document titled \u201cObjections to Case \nNo. 20-03568\u201d (Applicant exhibit (AE) A-B). His objections refer to the incorrect date on \nthe SOR, his belief that an employment reference was misleading, and his explanation \nconcerning the status of \u201cnew delinquencies\u201d referenced in the FORM, but not listed in \nthe SOR. Those objections are overruled.  \nConcerning the three new debts not alleged in the SOR, but referred to in the \nFORM, I will not consider them for disqualification purposes, but may consider them \nduring my analysis of the applicability of any mitigating conditions and the whole-person \nfactors. Applicant also responded to the FORM (AE C) and submitted two supporting \ndocuments (AE D-E). All exhibits are admitted into evidence without objections. The June \n2, 2021 transmittal letter from the Government is marked as an administrative exhibit (AD \nI). The case was assigned to me on July 9, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted six of the SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g), and denied one \nallegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful \nreview of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 25 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since March 2019. \nHe had a period of unemployment from February 2018 to March 2018. He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Air Force from 2014 to 2017, and was honorably discharged. He \nreceived his high school diploma in 2013 and he has since taken some college courses. \nHe married in 2014 and has two children. (Item 4; AE B) \nThe seven delinquent SOR debts total approximately $36,000. The debts are \ncomprised of collection accounts and charged-off accounts (auto repossession, credit \ncard, consumer debt, and medical debts). The debts are established by credit reports \nfrom March 2021 and February 2020, and his SOR admissions. (Items 3, 6-7) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to being furloughed from his job in \nOctober 2019. While he secured another job in January 2020, he was unable to pay his \nbills, because his wife lost her job in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Item 3; \nAE C) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$25,484 charge off. This is an auto account opened in June 2018. In \nhis SOR answer, Applicant denied this debt claiming that he recently made a payment \nand that the debt should be current. If it was not, he promised to make arrangements to \nsatisfy the debt.

This debt \nis unresolved. (Items 3, 6; AE C) \nApplicant stated that his current financial status is in good shape. He claimed to \nhave approximately $1,200 of disposable income at the end of each month after paying \nall his expenses. He claimed to have $2,500 in savings. No documentation was supplied \nto support these assertions. A recent credit report listed three new delinquent debts. He \nalso claimed his peers at work would describe him as \u201ca trustworthy, responsible, \nhardworking family man.\u201d He did not provide any documents from said peers.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has approximately $ 32,000 of delinquent debt. With the exception of \nrecently paying two of the smaller debts ($59 and $362) and having one debt cancelled \n($2,706), the larger debts remain unaddressed by him. He stated that he intended to pay \nthe larger debts, but offered no specific details on how he planned to do so. I find the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are recent and all \nbut two small debts, and a larger debt that was cancelled, remain unresolved. He did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. The \nthree new delinquent debts appearing on his March 2021 credit report emphasize this \npoint. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. While Applicant dealt with financial conditions beyond \nhis control (his job furlough and his wife\u2019s unemployment), I find he has not acted \nresponsibly in trying to resolve his debts. His efforts to resolve two small SOR debts are \ncommendable but insufficient to conclude that his overall financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. Likewise, he has failed to establish a good-faith effort to \nresolve his remaining delinquent debts. There is no evidence Applicant used a financial \ncounselor. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply, except to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, including his military service, his job \nfurlough, and his wife\u2019s unemployment. However, I have also considered his insufficient \nefforts to address his delinquent SOR debts, as well as the accumulation of three new \ndelinquent debts. Applicant has not established a track record of financial stability. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c; 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e and denied the allegation in \u00b6 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 41 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002 and master\u2019s degree in 2011. She married in 2014 and is separated from her spouse. She has two adult stepchildren. Applicant was unemployed from January 2010 to October 2010. She has worked for the same federal contractor since October 2010. (GE 3, GE 4) The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $25,252. In her February 2020 security clearance application (SCA), she disclosed the charged off delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($16,332), a repossessed vehicle, and a past due credit card debt that was not alleged ($224). Applicant did not disclose the four remaining SOR credit card debts: \u00b6 1.b-$4,947; \u00b6 1.c $2,089; \u00b6 1.d-$784; and \u00b6 1.e-$1,101. Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from June 2020 and May 2021 corroborate the delinquent debts alleged. In June 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of her background investigation. She told the investigator that she had been financially irresponsible in the past, but had gotten her finances under control. She is focused on saving instead of spending and is looking into investing in the stock market. She explained that most of her accounts became delinquent around December 2016 because ",

Items 1 through 6 \nare admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on August 23, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e and denied the \nallegation in \u00b6 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002 and master\u2019s \ndegree in 2011. She married in 2014 and is separated from her spouse. She has two \nadult stepchildren. Applicant was unemployed from January 2010 to October 2010. She \nhas worked for the same federal contractor since October 2010. (GE 3, GE 4) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $25,252. In her \nFebruary 2020 security clearance application (SCA), she disclosed the charged off \ndelinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($16,332), a repossessed vehicle, and a past due \ncredit card debt that was not alleged ($224). Applicant did not disclose the four remaining \nSOR credit card debts: \u00b6 1.b-$4,947; \u00b6 1.c $2,089; \u00b6 1.d-$784; and \u00b6 1.e-$1,101. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from June 2020 and May 2021 corroborate the \ndelinquent debts alleged. \nIn June 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of \nher background investigation. She told the investigator that she had been financially \nirresponsible in the past, but had gotten her finances under control. She is focused on \nsaving instead of spending and is looking into investing in the stock market. She explained \nthat most of her accounts became delinquent around December 2016 because at her old \nposition she was traveling overseas and collecting per diem, so she had more money. At \nher new position, she did not travel so did not earn as much money. Applicant further \nexplained that in order for her to maintain her current financial stability she cannot take \non additional financial obligations. She stated she was willing to contact some of the \ncreditors and find out if they would be willing to work with her on payment plans, but she \ncannot make substantial payments. (GE 4) \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle was repossessed (SOR \u00b61.a) and her account closed in 2018. \nShe has not resolved the account. She told the investigator that she intended to contact \nthe creditor to satisfy the account. She has been monitoring her credit report to see who \nowns the account because it is now charged off. This debt is not resolved. (GE 4) \nApplicant did not disclose the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. on her SCA. When \nconfronted with it by the government investigator, she explained this account was used \nin 2015 to purchase an Apple computer and an Apple tablet. It became delinquent in \n2017. She explained she did not disclose the account on her SCA because she forgot \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout it and has not heard from the creditor since it was charged off. She has made no \neffort to pay the debt. By the time her finances started to improve the account was \ncharged off, so she never attempted to contact the creditor. She stated she could attempt \nto contact the creditor to set up a payment plan. This debt is not resolved. \nThe credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c became delinquent in 2017. She did not disclose \nthe account because the account was closed, and she did not think she needed to list it. \nThe creditor contacted her when the account became delinquent in 2017, but she could \nnot pay the debt in full so she stopped making payments. Since then she has never tried \nto satisfy the debt because the creditor did not contact her again. This debt is not resolved. \nThe creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d contacted Applicant after the account \nbecame delinquent. She could not make the payments required, so Applicant stopped \nmaking payments. She did not attempt to satisfy the debt or contact the company again. \nShe did not disclose the account in her SCA. The debt is not resolved. \nThe charged off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is for a credit card. The account became \ndelinquent in 2017. The creditor contacted her regarding paying her account, but she was \nunable to pay it. She stated she forgot about the account, so did not disclose it on her \nSCA. The debt is unresolved. \nWhen confronted with the debts by a government investigator in June 2020 during \nher background interview, Applicant acknowledged she owed the debts, but said she \nforgot about some accounts, so she did not disclose them. Others were closed so she did \nnot think she had to disclose them. Section 26 of the SCA requires disclosure of \ndelinquencies within the past seven years for an \u201caccount or credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed.\u201d Applicant admitted to the \ngovernment investigator that after she lost her travel per diem she defaulted on several \ncredit cards because of it. Creditors had contacted her and because she could not pay, \nshe stopped making payments. She was aware that she had more than the two delinquent \ndebts she disclosed. I did not find her statements to the investigator credible that she \nmerely forgot to include these significant debts or that she did not think she had to disclose \nthem because the accounts had been closed. I find Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose her delinquent debts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has five delinquent debts totaling approximately $25,252 that began \naccumulating in approximately 2017 and remain unresolved. There is sufficient evidence \nto support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted owing all of the debts in the SOR. She attributed his financial \nproblems to her job changing and she was no longer collecting per diem from travel, so \nshe stopped paying the debts. Creditors have contacted her, but she has been unable to \nmake payments. In 2018, her car was repossessed. She has made no effort to resolve \nany debts or contact the creditors. Her debts are recent and ongoing. Her failure to \naddress any of her delinquent debts cast doubt on her reliability and judgment. AG\u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to the nature of her job changing and \nshe no longer was collecting per diem. I find this circumstance was marginally beyond \nher control. Although she relied on the per diem, it is not included as income, but it is \nmeant to reimburse her for travel expenses. I considered that she relied on it to \nsupplement her income, even though this was not fiscally responsible behavior. Applicant \nhas not done anything to resolve her debts. She failed to act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has had financial counseling or that her financial \nproblems are resolved or under control. There is no evidence she has made any good-\nfaith payments to resolve her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to any employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant was aware when she completed her SCA that because she was no \nlonger collecting per diem, she was unable to pay many of her credit cards. She was \ncontacted by creditors, but advised them she was unable to pay her debts and could not \nafford the payment plans proposed. She disclosed her repossessed vehicle and an \nunalleged debt, but did not disclose four credit cards debts. I do not find it credible that \nshe forgot the debts or that she did not think she had to disclose her delinquent accounts \nbecause they were closed. The SCA is clear on the type of accounts to be disclosed, \nincluding charged-off credit cards and suspended accounts. I find Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose all of her delinquent accounts in her SCA. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \nApplicant did not correct her omission until she was confronted with the accounts \nduring her background interview. She did not make a prompt good-faith effort to correct \nthe omissions. Deliberately failing to be honest in a SCA is not a minor concern?. Her \nactions cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above \nmitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion. She did not provide evidence to \nconclude she has established a track record of being fiscally responsible or addressing \nher financial obligations. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is 45 years old, and he is seeking employment as a security guard. (Item \n2 at 7, 15) He was employed as a correctional officer from 2016 to 2018, and he was on \nactive duty in the Army or in the Army Reserve from 2003 to 2015.

(Id.) \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts in his December 18, 2018 SCA. \n(Item 2 at 36-37) During his March 22, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninterview, Applicant said: (1) the utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($226) was the result of identity \ntheft; (2) for several other accounts, such as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($5,393), 1.n ($130), 1.k ($2,406), \n1.l ($731), 1.m ($800), and 1.o ($504), he said he was unaware of the debt, and he would \nfind out about the debt; (3) for still others, such as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($1,598) and 1.e ($758), \nhe was unable to figure out how to pay the debt; and (4) the vehicle-related debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c ($6,470) was not paid because the vehicle was wrecked. (Item 3) The other five \nSOR debts were not discussed in his OPM interview. (Id.)   \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel described Applicant\u2019s security-significant \nbehavior and noted the absence of mitigation. The FORM informed Applicant that he had \n30 days from the receipt of the FORM \u201cin which to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as \nappropriate. . . . If [Applicant does] not file any objections or submit any additional \ninformation . . . [his] case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination \nbased solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 3 (emphasis added)) \nApplicant did not provide any response to the FORM. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance\ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or\npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the\nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established\nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally\nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations\nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden\nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for\nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n \n \n \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of\na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th\nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The\nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in\nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access\nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant described one circumstance beyond his control, which adversely \naffected his finances. He was the victim of identity theft, and he believed the thief \ngenerated the utility debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($226). However, \u201c[e]ven if Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his \ncontrol, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); \nISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 1, 1999)). Applicant did not provide a copy of a police report about the identity \ntheft or any correspondence with the creditor or credit reporting company disclosing the \nidentity theft or seeking correction of his financial records. \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether he maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant \ndid not provide supporting documentary evidence that he maintained contact with his \ncreditors. He did not provide any evidence of any payments to the SOR creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report did not include five of the SOR debts: 1.k \n($2,406); 1.l ($731); 1.m ($800); 1.n ($130); and 1.o ($504).

Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Dec. 29, 2016). \u201c[N]on-collectability of a debt does not preclude \nconsideration of the debt and circumstances surrounding it in a security clearance \nadjudication.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-05049 at 3 (App. Bd.

July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nApplicant did not describe any financial counseling. He did not provide \ndocumentary evidence showing he was not responsible for any of the ten unresolved \nSOR debts or explaining why he was unable to make greater documented progress \nresolving the ten SOR debts totaling $50,485 in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j. There is \ninsufficient evidence showing Applicant\u2019s multiple failures to pay debts were prudent \ngood-faith decisions. He did not establish he was unable to make greater progress sooner \nin the resolution of his ongoing financial delinquencies totaling $50,485. He did not \nestablish that his financial delinquencies were unlikely to recur. His finances continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 45 years old, and he is seeking employment as a security guard. He \nwas employed as a correctional officer from 2016 to 2018, and he was on active duty in \nthe Army or in the Army Reserve from 2003 to 2015. He was discharged under honorable \nconditions. In 1994, he received a high school diploma. In 1996, he was awarded an \nassociate\u2019s degree in microcomputers, and in 1998, he received an associate\u2019s degree in \nbusiness administration. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving the ten delinquent SOR debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j. \nIt is unclear why he did not provide evidence about his income, expenses, and efforts to \nresolve the debts in the SOR. His lack of responsible financial action raises unmitigated \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSee AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due debts, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. I have carefully applied the law, \nas set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

Dorsey, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/30/2021 \nDecision \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for access to classified information. He did not present sufficient evidence to \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate his history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is \ndecided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non May 12, 2020. (Exhibit 3) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. He provided additional information when interviewed during a 2020 \nbackground investigation. (Exhibit 4) Thereafter, on March 24, 2021, after reviewing the \navailable information, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, \nFort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action \nunder the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2021. His written answers were \nmixed; he admitted eight delinquent accounts and denied the ninth; he provided brief \nexplanatory remarks in a one-page memorandum; and he did not provide supporting \ndocumentation. He requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. \nOn April 29, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits herein. The FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant who received it May 12, 2021. He did not reply to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me July 28, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for his job with a federal contractor. He works full-time as an \nelectronics technician for a company doing business in the defense industry. He has \nbeen so employed since July 2018. He has held a security clearance in the past while \nworking in the defense industry and during military service. (Exhibit 3 at Section 25) He \nis married with adult children. His educational history includes an associate degree in \ncomputer electronics awarded in 1996. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes honorable military service on active duty \nwith the U.S. Navy during 1986-1996 and 1999-2009, when he retired. He then worked \nas a residential television repair technician during 2010-2012. In mid-2012, he relocated \nto his state of current residence and worked as an electronics technician for a company \nin the defense industry. Beginning in 2016, he owned a junk hauling and removal \nbusiness, which operated as a franchise of a nationwide company. His business closed \nin about mid-2018, when he returned to working in the defense industry. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of nine delinquent \naccounts in amounts ranging from $1,001 to $9,478 for a total of about $46,432. Two \nare collection accounts and seven are charged-off accounts. He disclosed a number of \ndelinquent financial accounts in his security clearance application. (Exhibit 3 at Section \n26) He admitted eight of the nine debts in his answer to the SOR. In addition to his \nadmissions, the nine delinquent accounts in the SOR are established by a February 23, \n2021 credit report. (Exhibit 7) \nDuring his 2020 background investigation, Applicant attributed his financial \nproblems or difficulties to a business failure. (Exhibit 4 at 6-7) He explained that his junk \nhauling and removal business was a franchise of a nationwide company, and various \nproblems with the franchiser resulted in his business becoming unprofitable, leading to \nclosure of his business in 2018. He did not provide supporting documentation \nconcerning the business failure. \n2 \n\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed to be making payments to various \ncreditors and thereby reducing outstanding balances. He did not provide documentation \nin support of his claim. Likewise, he did not take advantage of the opportunity to provide \nsupporting documentation in reply to the FORM. Given these circumstances, I find that \nthe nine delinquent accounts in the SOR are wholly unresolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nSubstantial evidence shows Applicant has more than $45,000 in collection or charged-\noff accounts, which is not a minor or trivial amount. The disqualifying conditions noted \nabove apply. \nAn applicant lives in the real world and can expect real-world problems. The \nsecurity clearance process recognizes that bad things can happen to good people and \nhas a certain tolerance for the possibility of human error and honest mistakes. But an \napplicant is still expected to keep their house in reasonable order. In financial cases, \nkeeping their house in order includes providing a reasonable amount of documentation \nin support of their case in order to show whatever steps and remedial actions they are \ntaking to resolve their financial problems. The security clearance process, like other \nlarge bureaucratic institutions such as banks, hospitals, and insurance companies, does \nnot run on word-of-mouth. It runs on documentation. \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems, which are unresolved and ongoing. I have reviewed the mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F and conclude none are fully applicable. In particular, the \nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b), concerning circumstances largely beyond one\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \ncontrol, does not fully apply. Certainly, the business failure in 2018 was a circumstance \nlargely beyond his control. Nevertheless, he has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Although his claims seem plausible on their face, he has not provided \nsupporting documentation to establish his claims. Accordingly, he does not receive the \nbenefit of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) or any of the other mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 20. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In doing so, I gave \nweight to his 20 years of honorable military service for which I have respect and \nappreciation. I conclude that he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

She did not present sufficient documentary \nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate her history of financial problems. \nAccordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \nin April 2019. (Exhibit 2) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP. The SF 86 is \ncommonly known as a security clearance application. \nApplicant was interviewed during the course of a 2019 background investigation. \n(Exhibit 3) Thereafter, on February 20, 2021, after reviewing the available information, \nthe DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 10, 2021. She included numerous \ndocuments (Attachments A \u2013 E, so far as I can tell) with the answer.

She requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. \nOn May 14, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it June 2, 2021. She \nreplied to the FORM by way of a letter from an attorney who has represented Applicant \nas legal counsel in six civil disputes filed against her. The letter briefly discusses the \nstatus of each dispute. It is admitted as Exhibit A without objections. The case was \nassigned to me August 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for her job as a senior systems engineer for a large company in \nthe defense industry. She has been so employed since July 2019. (Exhibit 3) Her \neducational background includes a high school diploma awarded in 2001, an associate \ndegree in 2003, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2011. She has been married and \ndivorced more than once with the last divorce in 2011. (Exhibits 2 and 3) She has two \nminor children from the marriages. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes a number of jobs since obtaining her \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. In reverse chronological order, she worked as a consulting \nengineer from August 2018 until July 2019, when she began his current job. Before that, \nshe worked as a cloud administrator, project manager, and operations manager for \nabout two years during 2016-2018. Before that, she worked as a senior IT consultant for \nless than a year during 2015-2016. Before that, she worked as a senior IT consultant for \nabout two years during 2013-2015. Before that, she worked as a remote operations \nmanager for less than six months during 2013. And before that, she worked as a IT \nmanager for less than two years during 2011-2013. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history also includes military service.

The delinquent accounts consist of a \ndeficiency balance after repossession of an automobile, a charged-off account, and nine \nmedical collection accounts. The bankruptcy is established by bankruptcy court records. \n(Exhibit 6) The delinquent accounts are established by a May 2019 credit report and a \nMarch 2020 credit report. (Exhibits 4 and 5) All these matters are discussed below. \nApplicant\u2019s attributes the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case (SOR \u00b6 1.l) to a divorce in \n2011, which resulted in a loss of household income and she was unable to support \nherself and her two children. (Exhibit 3) The bankruptcy case followed in 2012, with the \ninitial filing in April 2012, and the court granting her a discharge in September 2012. \n(Exhibit 6) The discharged liabilities were 24 unsecured debts for about $26,000 in total. \nThe second largest delinquency in the SOR is a deficiency balance of $9,981 \nafter repossession in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The March 2020 credit report describes it as an \ninvoluntary repossession with a current balance of $9,981. (Exhibit 5) In her answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant denied the allegation on the basis the account was paid in full and \npresented two documents in support thereof. (Answer at Attachment A) The \ndocumentation shows that a repossession of a 2008 Jeep occurred in December 2018, \nand the vehicle was sold at auction for a net amount of $2,947. In the June 2021 \nattorney letter, the attorney advises that Applicant elected to settle the case directly and \npaid the debt in full resulting in satisfaction of a previously entered judgment. (Exhibit A) \nApplicant did not provide documentary proof of payment or a copy of the satisfaction of \njudgment. I find this account is unresolved. \nThe largest delinquency is a $10,359 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The \nMarch 2019 credit report describes it as a charged-off installment loan (auto) for \n$10,359 on July 2017. (Exhibit 4) The more recent March 2020 credit report shows a \nbalance of $7,599. (Exhibit 5) In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation \non the basis that the amount owed is now $2,699 with $350 monthly payments. She \nexplained it stems from a car loan she apparently co-signed with her father who passed \naway unexpectedly in March 2016. (Answer at Attachment B) In the June 2021 attorney \nletter, the attorney advises that Applicant settled the case agreeing to pay a total of \n$9,000 in $350 monthly installments; has paid $7,000 per the agreement; and has a \nbalance due of $2,000 as of the date of the letter. Applicant did not provide \ndocumentary proof of payment or satisfaction of a settlement agreement or judgment. I \nfind this account is unresolved. \nAltogether, the nine medical collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 k total about \n$6,875. In the June 2021 attorney letter, the attorney advises, in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6, \nthat Applicant has amicably resolved two collection lawsuits for unpaid residual medical \nbills as follows: (1) agreeing to pay $4,293 in $250 monthly installments beginning \nAugust 2021; and (2) agreeing to pay $1,706 in $150 monthly installments beginning in \nJune 2021.

Likewise, she did not provide \ndocumentation to establish the billing error she asserts is the basis of her dispute. I find \nthe nine medical collection accounts are unresolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \n1 Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nSubstantial evidence shows Applicant has about $27,000 in delinquent accounts, which \nare unresolved and ongoing. The disqualifying conditions noted above apply. \nAn applicant lives in the real world and can expect real-world problems, such as \na job loss. The security clearance process recognizes that bad things can happen to \ngood people and has a certain tolerance for the possibility of human error and honest \nmistakes. But an applicant is still expected to keep their house in reasonable order. In \nfinancial cases, keeping their house in order includes providing a reasonable amount of \ndocumentation in support of their case to show whatever steps and remedial actions \nthey are taking to resolve their financial problems. The security clearance process, like \nother large bureaucratic institutions such as banks, hospitals, universities, and \ninsurance companies, does not run on word-of-mouth. It runs on documentation. \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated her history of \nfinancial problems. I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nconclude none are fully applicable. With that said, I am not concerned about the 2012 \nChapter 7 bankruptcy case because it happened nearly a decade ago and was the \nresult of a divorce. Applicant has not remarried since her last divorce in 2011. The \nbankruptcy is no longer a present concern. \nThe same cannot be said for the remaining $27,000 in delinquent accounts. Of \nsome concern here are the implications of the numerous collection lawsuits (six during \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2018-2021) brought against Applicant as outlined in the June 2021 attorney letter. The \nnumber of lawsuits suggests a measurable degree of financial irresponsibility or \ninstability or both. Concerning her various claims of repayment, the June 2021 attorney \nletter is helpful information but by itself not sufficient to fully credit Applicant. What is \nmissing here should be obvious; namely, documentation to establish proof of payment. \nIn short, Applicant has not provided sufficient documentary evidence to establish her \nclaims of payment made to her various creditors as well as the current status of her \ndebts. Accordingly, she does not receive the benefit of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she \nhas not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d The record establishes \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). Additional information is contained in the mitigation section, \ninfra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He has made some positive lifestyle changes: moved to \na different state; proposed marriage; made a commitment to his current employment and \nto abide by laws, rules, and regulations; begun a master\u2019s degree program; and ended \nhis association with marijuana users. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana possession \nand use on his SCA, during his OPM interview, in his SOR response, and in his FORM \nresponse. He expressed his remorse about his marijuana possession and use. He does \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future.   \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana use, and \nthe Appeal Board said: \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/ \n1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \n\u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nSee ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 20-01772 (App. Bd. Sept. 14, 2021) (noting \ncontinued relevance of October 15, 2014 DNI Memorandum in the application of \nGuideline H for marijuana cases). \nApplicant used marijuana from November 2010 to October 2012 about once a \nmonth during his first two years in college. He did not use marijuana from 2012 until March \n2019. His marijuana use on two occasions in March 2019 occurred while he held a \nsecurity clearance. His marijuana use before 2019 will not be used for disqualification \npurposes; however, it will be considered in the application of mitigating conditions and \nunder the whole-person concept. He did not describe any drug-abuse counseling or \ntreatment. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent marijuana possession and use occurred while he held a \nsecurity clearance. \u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after having been placed on notice \nof its security significance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, \nmay be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd.

The DOHA Appeal Board has emphasized that a failure to effectuate a \nprevious promise not to use marijuana is an important factor in a credibility assessment \nbecause it detracts from trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 19-02499 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJuly 7, 2021) (reversing grant of security clearance where Applicant failed to keep \npromises to refrain from illegal drug use). Recently, Applicant indicated he does not plan \nor intend to use marijuana in the future; however, I have lingering concerns about his \nfuture marijuana use. Guideline H security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 29 years old, and he has worked for defense contractors as a \nmechanical engineer or an associate member staff engineer since December 2014. In \n2014, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree, and since 2016, he has been participating in \na post-graduate education program. His manager, coworkers, and friends described him \nas professional, innovative, diligent, honest, trustworthy, loyalty, mature, knowledgeable, \nand reliable. They have not observed Applicant\u2019s impairment at work. He is an asset to \nhis employer. He received an annual pay raise of over $4,000 on May 25, 2021. He \nreceived excellent performance evaluations. He made several lifestyle changes that \nsupport his abstinence from future marijuana possession and use. \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana possession and use on his SCAs, during his \nOPM interviews, in his SOR response, and in his FORM response. An honest and candid \nself-report of drug abuse is an important indication that, if granted security clearance \neligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to national security, even if the \ndisclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career or personal \nreputation. However, the mitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nhis marijuana possession and use as recently as March 2019 while holding a security \nclearance. In 2014 and 2015, he indicated he did not plan or intend to use marijuana in \nthe future. He expressed these intentions in a security context. His recent expressions of \nhis intentions not to use marijuana in the future are given less weight because of his \nviolations of previous expressions of his plans in 2014 and 2015 not to use marijuana. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 7.) \nHe has been employed with the defense contractor since May of 2020. (GX 1 at page \n11.) He is married, and has two adult children. (GX 1 at pages 22~23, and 27.) \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct & Guideline D, Sexual Behavior \n1.a. and 2.a. Applicant was arrested in May of 2017, and charged with Electronic \nEnticement of a Minor. He was subsequently convicted of Felony Attempted Sexual \nAssault. Applicant solicited a sexual liaison with an alleged minor, who was actually \nsomeone in law enforcement. (TR at page 42 line 12 to page 53 line 14, and GXs \n6~12.) He was sentenced to 18 month confinement, which Applicant served, was \nplaced on probation until July of 2023, and is required to register as a sex offender. (TR \nat page 42 line 12 to page 53 line 14, and GX 13.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of a felony. He served 18 months in confinement. \nApplicant is on probation as a result of his felony conviction until July of 2023. The \nevidence establishes the above three disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s felony conviction, given the fact \nthat he is on probation until July of 2023. Although he provided evidence of a successful \nwork history with his employer (AppX D), that evidence does not outweigh the fact that \nhe is now on probation. The evidence does not establish mitigation under either of the \nabove conditions. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. All are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant attempted a sexual liaison with a person he believed to be a minor. His \nconduct was criminal, and represents sexual behavior that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant, a convicted felon and \nregistered sex offender, is still on probation for his criminal conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline J and D in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nsubmitted a plethora of supporting statements from those that know him well. (AppX C.) \nHowever, overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct and Sexual Behavior security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Applicant is a 38-year-old Systems Integration Engineer who has worked for the same employer since 2009. He has had a security clearance since 2010. Applicant graduated from high school in 2002 and is currently taking post-secondary courses online. Married in 2005, he is the parent of a teenage child. His wife manages the family\u2019s finances. On his January 2021 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed his debts. He blames their creation on an incident in 2012. In that year, Applicant chose to participate in a labor strike at work. It lasted 10 months, much longer than the few weeks initially anticipated. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s savings were soon depleted and obligations became delinquent in early 2013. (FORM, Item 4 at 2) At least two of his accounts went to collection after Applicant and his wife chose to cease making payments on those accounts. When those accounts appeared as derogatory information on his credit report, he chose to let them remain on his credit report for seven years and then have them deleted from his credit report due to their age. He still plans on maintaining this strategy.

He has had a security clearance since 2010. Applicant \ngraduated from high school in 2002 and is currently taking post-secondary courses \nonline. Married in 2005, he is the parent of a teenage child. His wife manages the \nfamily\u2019s finances. \nOn his January 2021 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed \nhis debts. He blames their creation on an incident in 2012. In that year, Applicant chose \nto participate in a labor strike at work. It lasted 10 months, much longer than the few \nweeks initially anticipated.

He still \nplans on maintaining this strategy. (FORM, Item 3 at 42-43; Item 4 at 2) \nAt issue in the SOR are five delinquent accounts (SOR allegations 1.a-1.e) \nreflecting debts amounting to about $24,000. In response to the SOR, Applicant denied \nthe debt noted at 1.a for $3,058, writing that he has no record of this debt. He also \ndenied the debts at 1.b for $9,204 and 1.e for $1,811 for approximately the same \nreason (FORM, Item 2 at 1-2). He admits the allegations related to the debts at 1.c-1.d, \namounting to about $10,000 related to adverse judgments. \nIn his subject interview, Applicant admitted the debt in SOR allegation 1.e, but \nclaimed the accounts referenced in SOR allegations 1.a and 1.b were his wife\u2019s credit \ncards in his wife\u2019s name (FORM, Item 4 at 2-3) He offered documents reflecting \njudgments against his wife, but they failed to show that the judgments were for the \nsame accounts referenced in the allegations and in his credit report. (FORM, Item 4 at \n6-8) Applicant provided no other documents and did not submit any materials directly \nrelated to the delinquent accounts at issue. There is no indication of efforts to address \nthese accounts in recent years. There is no documentation showing Applicant has \nreceived financial counseling. His plan with regard to his delinquent debts in collection is \nto let them be dropped by the credit reporting agencies after seven years \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas acquired delinquent debt. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder these facts, three conditions could mitigate related security concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-\nprofit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or under control; and  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributes his past financial difficulties to his voluntary participation in a \nlabor strike in 2012. The fact that his participation was voluntary obviates application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b). There is no indication Applicant has received financial counseling, so AG \u00b6 \n20(c) cannot apply. Applicant provided no documentation reflecting any efforts to \naddress the delinquent accounts at issue. The materials he submitted regarding \njudgments against his wife were not linked to the delinquent accounts at issue in SOR \nallegations 1.a and 1.b. There was no showing by Applicant that he has initiated any \neffort to address his delinquent debts other than letting time pass until these derogatory \nentries are removed from his credit report. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old high school graduate who has worked as a systems \nintegration engineer since 2009. He has maintained a security clearance since 2010. He \nis married and has one teenage son. \nAfter choosing to participate in a protracted labor strike, Applicant found his \nsavings depleted, money became tight, and he acquired debt. That incident occurred \nnearly a decade ago and debt still exists. At least two debts acquired as a result of the \nstrike became delinquent. Rather than addressing those accounts before or after they \nwere referred for collection, he has chosen to let them be removed by the credit \nreporting agencies as dated material after seven years.

Applicant was given an opportunity to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not \nfile objections to the Government\u2019s evidence, nor submit any evidence in support of her \nposition. Items 2-5 are admitted into evidence without objections. The case was \nassigned to me on October 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations concerning her student loans and the \ndeficiency amount from a vehicle repossession, with explanations (SOR 1.a, 1.b, and \n1.e). She denied the remaining allegations. The admissions are adopted as findings of \nfact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old. She has worked for her current government-contractor-\nemployer since May 2019. She has a full employment history dating back to 2008 as a \nproject manager master scheduler. She holds two associate\u2019s degrees and multiple \nprofessional certifications. She was married for the fourth time in 2019 (her dates of \ndivorce: 1983, 2000 and 2017) and has three adult children. (Items 4-5) \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,800. The \ndebts are comprised of collections and charged-off accounts (credit card, consumer \ndebt, student loans, and an auto repossession). The debts are established by \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA), her background interview in May 2020, \ncredit reports from April 2020 and June 2021, and her SOR admissions in her answer. \n(Items 1-5) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to her ex-husband (she does not \nidentify which ex-husband) who she claims opened up several credit cards in her name \nwithout her knowledge (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g). She claims only discovering these \naccounts during her divorce. Her credit reports show that these were individual \naccounts. She failed to produce documentation supporting her assertion that her ex-\nhusband was responsible for these debts. Her most recent credit report shows that she \ndisputed the debts alleged in SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g. No evidence of resolution of these \ndisputes was presented. In her SCA, she stated she would allow these accounts to \n\u201cdrop off my credit report.\u201d Applicant claims she paid the telecommunications account \nalleged in SOR 1.h and that account no longer is listed on her most recent credit card \nand appears to be less than seven years old. This account is resolved for Applicant. \nThe remaining accounts remain unpaid. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant claimed that she believed her student loans were in forbearance, but \ndiscovered in December 2019 that they were not. She further claimed that upon \nreceiving this information she combined her student loans, paid the past-due amount, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nand began making monthly payments of $246. She did not present documentation for \nany of these actions. These accounts are not resolved. (Items 1, 5) \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant claimed she was forced into a voluntary \nrepossession of a vehicle because her ex-husband would not relinquish the vehicle. \nDuring her background interview, she admitted that she could not make the $800 \nmonthly payments and therefore voluntarily turned in the vehicle. There is no evidence \nshe made any payments toward the delinquency. This debt is unresolved. (Items 1, 5) \nApplicant failed to present documentation showing that she made payments on \nany of her debts. She did not provided information about her current budget. She has \nnot sought any financial counseling. (Item 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAll but one of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. She has \na history of unpaid debts. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are ongoing and \ntherefore recent. Except for one telecommunication debt, all the remaining debts are \nunresolved. She did not provide sufficient evidence to show that her financial problems \nare unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Although her divorces and issues with \nan ex-husband are circumstances beyond her control, she failed to act responsibly in \naddressing her debts. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. She failed to seek financial \ncounseling and has not put forth a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts. She \nalso failed to document the legitimacy of her debt disputes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(e) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not established a \ntrack record of financial stability. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In his application, he was completely candid about past illegal drug use and has been forthcoming about the topic ever since. During his senior year of high school, Applicant first used illegal drugs. As a senior in 2014, he used marijuana about two times. Applicant never used the drug again until March 2016, during his freshman year of college. His marijuana use slowly increased until he regularly used the drug until his May 2019 graduation. He also purchased the drug on various occasions between 2017 and September 2019. After graduation, his marijuana use declined, but did not completely cease. Between May 2019 and February 2020, he used the drug approximately 7 \u2013 10 times. As he began his current job, he quit using marijuana. He knew drug use was against his employer\u2019s",

He is single and currently lives with his parents. \nApplicant has no criminal record. He started working for his present employer in January \n2020. The following month, he learned that he would need to apply for a security \nclearance, which he did in March 2020. In his application, he was completely candid about \npast illegal drug use and has been forthcoming about the topic ever since. \nDuring his senior year of high school, Applicant first used illegal drugs. As a senior \nin 2014, he used marijuana about two times. Applicant never used the drug again until \nMarch 2016, during his freshman year of college. His marijuana use slowly increased until \nhe regularly used the drug until his May 2019 graduation. He also purchased the drug on \nvarious occasions between 2017 and September 2019. After graduation, his marijuana \nuse declined, but did not completely cease. Between May 2019 and February 2020, he \nused the drug approximately 7 \u2013 10 times. As he began his current job, he quit using \nmarijuana. He knew drug use was against his employer\u2019s policies. (FORM, Item 5 at 43; \nItem 6 at 2-4) When informed he would need to apply for a security clearance, the \nseriousness of his past drug use became apparent. He candidly detailed his past drug \nuse on his security clearance application. \nIn addition to his past marijuana use, Applicant also disclosed his use of cocaine \napproximately 20-25 times during college. He also noted that he used it one more time in \nNovember 2019, between college and finding employment. The cocaine he used \nbelonged to others, but he volunteered that he once purchased the drug in April 2018, \nduring what he described as a low point in his life. (FORM, Item 4 at 1). He also used \nLSD in September 2017 and April 2018 while on college camping trips. \nApplicant reiterated that he has quit using illegal drugs. He has no desire to use \ncocaine or LSD again. Although he believes marijuana should be legalized, he intends to \ncontinue staying away from marijuana in order to lead a more adult life and pursue a \nprofessional career. (FORM, Item 6 at 6) His signed response to the FORM repeats that \ncommitment. (Response to the FORM) \nOn May 25, 2021, Applicant met with a licensed substance abuse treatment \nprofessional (LSATP) and counselor (LPC) who is also a certified substance abuse \ncounselor. It was determined that Applicant\u2019s present alcohol and drug use do not \nconstitute a substance use disorder. His alcohol use is limited to the occasional beer on \nweekends. The counselor confirmed Applicant\u2019s intention to refrain from illegal drugs for \nprofessional reasons. It was concluded that Applicant\u2019s abstinence to date demonstrates \nhis willingness and ability to refrain from illegal drug use. \nApplicant, himself, stresses that he has matured since starting work and \ncommencing a career. (Response to the FORM) He wrote that he has had sufficient time \nto reflect on his past behavior and regrets his former immaturity. He now lives far from \ncollege and presently lives with his family, and his goals and aspirations reflect his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmaturation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under the \nAG, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national interest. In reaching this decision, I have drawn \nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained \nin the record. \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. Under the Directive, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions include, by \nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the national \ninterest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nThe security concern for this guideline (Guideline H) is set forth in AG \u00b6 24. There, \nit is noted that the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances \nthat can cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness. Such use also raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nHere, Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from late 2014, when he \nwas in high school, through early February 2019, as he began his present work. He \npurchased the drug between 2017 and September 2019 on various occasions. He also \nused cocaine between November 2016 and November 2019, and bought the drug once \nin April 2018. In addition, he used LSD twice, between September 2017 and April 2018. \nThis drug use raises AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . . \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as confirmed by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nraises the security concerns noted under this guideline. Therefore, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security \nconcerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of \nabstinence, including but not limited to: (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \nApplicant\u2019s past drug use began in high school and continued when he went away \nto college. Like many of his peers in that age frame, his use started as experimental, then \nbecame recreational. As he completed his university undergraduate degree, his drug use \nwaned. \nUpon graduation and his acceptance of a job that would prove to be the first step \ntoward a career, Applicant gave up drug use in order to comport his behavior with that of \na mature professional. His goals now are to establish himself as a professional in his field. \nHis past drug use was candidly detailed on his security clearance application, not hidden \nor obfuscated by lies or excuses. He has been forthcoming about his past drug use ever \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nsince. He is now far from his collegiate milieu and enjoys the stability of his family\u2019s \nhousehold. Given these facts, Applicant\u2019s age, and circumstances, his past drug use can \nbe described as youthful indiscretion that he, himself, openly recognizes as unlawful and \ninconsistent with both a professional career and the maintenance of a security clearance. \nThere is no indication Applicant spends time with drug-using acquaintances or in \nenvironments conducive to drug use. He has written of his intent not to go back to drug \nuse now that he has committed himself to a professional career. He is now at an age \nwhere he can reinvent himself as a mature adult, not just a socializing college student. A \nthorough evaluation by a qualified LSATP/LPC indicates that Applicant has no \ndependence on any substances, including alcohol, and that Applicant recognizes his past \ndrug use was immature and illegal. Under these facts, and given Applicant\u2019s youth and \nrecent adjustment to a mature, professional lifestyle, AG \u00b6 26(a)-(b) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. The \nfinal determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person analysis \nbased on the record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s drug use, I considered available facts \nrelated to his age, reasons for using illegal drugs and the existent circumstances during \nhis period of drug use, recent maturation, academic status, professional \ngoals and \nattainments, present lifestyle, and future intentions. \nLike many of today\u2019s youth, Applicant tried, experimented, then used illegal drugs \nin high school and college. Between college and starting professional work, his drug use \nwaned, then was put aside so he could reinvent himself as an aspiring young professional. \nHe was thoroughly honest and detailed about his past drug use. He also provided highly \nbelievable reasons for quitting their use, thus helping to demonstrate his maturation since \nschool. \nA counselor has confirmed that Applicant has no dependencies and is sincere in \nhis commitment to eschew drugs in favor of a professional career. By all appearances, \nApplicant\u2019s past drug use, while relatively recent, has been put behind him. While only \ndrug-free for a year-and-a-half, that is a significant time period for one his age. I find \nApplicant is sincere in his commitment to remain drug-free. Drug involvement security \nconcerns are mitigated. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 64, is married and has two minor children. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1975 to 1981 receiving an honorable discharge. (Item 1) He obtained an undergraduate degree in 1990. Applicant completed his security clearance application on August 20, 2019. (Item 2) He has held a security clearance since the military. He has been employed as an analyst from July, 2019 to the present. (Item 1) Before that he was self-employed as a freelance research and design practitioner. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $5,378 for tax year 2015 (1.a); that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $95,396.53 for tax year 2016 (1.b); that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $553.44 for tax year 2017. (1.c); and that he is indebted to a state for delinquent taxes in the amount of $24,427 for tax year 2016 (1.d). The Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations and provided explanations. Applicant stated the delinquencies are a result of significantly reduced income for those years with an additional issue of a foreclosure on his state rental property in 2016, resulting in a substantial Capital Gains Tax recapture for the Federal and state taxes. He also acknowledged that he was delinquent on another state tax but has since repaid that amount. He further stated that he i",

The SOR further informed Applicant that, \nbased on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) \non May 19, 2021.

He served in the U.S. \nNavy from 1975 to 1981 receiving an honorable discharge. (Item 1) He obtained an \nundergraduate degree in 1990. Applicant completed his security clearance application \non August 20, 2019. (Item 2) He has held a security clearance since the military. He has \nbeen employed as an analyst from July, 2019 to the present. (Item 1) Before that he was \nself-employed as a freelance research and design practitioner. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for \ndelinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $5,378 for tax year 2015 (1.a); that \nApplicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the approximate \namount of $95,396.53 for tax year 2016 (1.b); that Applicant is indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $553.44 for tax year 2017. \n(1.c); and that he is indebted to a state for delinquent taxes in the amount of $24,427 for \ntax year 2016 (1.d). The Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations and provided \nexplanations. \nApplicant stated the delinquencies are a result of significantly reduced income for \nthose years with an additional issue of a foreclosure on his state rental property in 2016, \nresulting in a substantial Capital Gains Tax recapture for the Federal and state taxes. He \nalso acknowledged that he was delinquent on another state tax but has since repaid that \namount. He further stated that he is currently in a repayment arrangement with the other \nstate. (Answer to SOR) He also stated that he retained an enrolled agent to negotiate and \ninitiate a repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant disclosed in his security clearance \nquestionnaire that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2013, in the amount of $100,000. \nAll debts were discharged. There was no other information concerning the bankruptcy \nother than financial hardship. (Item 1) \nIn response to Applicant\u2019s interrogatories, he noted that he filed federal income tax \nreturns for tax year 2015 \u2013 2019, but he is not in a payment plan for the delinquencies. \n(Item 3) Applicant stated in that same interrogatory that he was in a payment plan with \none state for tax years 2015 and 2016, but did not provide any details of the payments. \n(Item 3) He is not in a payment plan for the other state. He has not started a payment \nplan with the IRS. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2019 subject interview, he noted that he is self-employed and travels \nabroad as part of his freelance business. He also explained the financial hardship which \ncaused the bankruptcy. He admits that he owes about $260,000, including interest and \npenalty to the IRS. He stated that he intended to establish a payment plan with the IRS \nin the next week after his subject interview. There is no evidence of a plan in place in this \nrecord. He also stated that he just does not have the funds. (Item 3) He has a budget and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas a monthly net income of $5,800. He does not have a dedicated savings account. He \nuses any extra money to bring his mortgage current. \nAs to SOR 1.a and 1.b, and 1.c, Applicant admits that he has unpaid federal taxes \nfor the years in question, which total approximately $101,328.15. He submitted IRS \ntranscripts to confirm the amount. He is still not in a repayment plan. \nAs to SOR 1.d, Applicant has set up a payment plan for his delinquent state taxes \n(Item 2) with the other state. He pays $500 per month. He submitted documentation that \nindicates he has paid $500 a month since 2018 for tax year 2016. It appears that there is \na $24,413 balance. (Item 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his latest security clearance application, \nestablish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness \nto satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to \u2026\u2026.. or pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant admitted that he owed delinquent debt for his Federal taxes as noted in \nthe SOR since 2015. He stated in his interview in 2019 that he would start a repayment \nplan with the IRS. At this time, he has not done so. He reached out to someone, but has \nnot followed through. He is in a repayment plan for a state tax since 2018 with a current \nbalance of $24, 427. He has not received counseling. \nThere is no evidence to show that Applicant has made a consistent or concerted \neffort to resolve any of his tax issues except for his recent involvement with the state tax \ndebts. He has a history of failing to pay his income taxes. He does not have a track record \nof financial responsibility in this area for the federal taxes. He started in 2018 to address \nthe state taxes. He has shown a disregard for paying income tax as required by law. \nApplicant did not provide a good reason as to why he did not act earlier to resolve the \nsituation. \n Applicant has not acted responsibly and was not proactive. Without documentary \nevidence of more efforts, he has not demonstrated a track record of resolving federal \nfinancial problems and there is no indication that his financial situation is under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(a)-20(d) and 20(g) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain \nunresolved. He is now trying to work with a enrolled agent to enter into an IRS repayment \nplan. He has not met his burden of proof in this case. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.c against Applicant and 1d. for Applicant. \nThe Appeal Board opined that unalleged conduct (delinquent taxes) can be \nconsidered for certain purposes although not alleged in 1.c and 1.d. Even in \ncircumstances where an applicant has purportedly corrected his federal tax problems, \nand is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, these adjustments do not \npreclude careful consideration of an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her \nlongstanding past behavior evidencing irresponsibility to pay income taxes. Applicant\u2019s, \naction, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s military career in the U.S. Navy, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness on \ndelinquent federal taxes. He did file his income tax returns, but he has not paid his federal \ntax debts debt since 2015. He is working on the state delinquent tax. I conclude that it is \nnot in the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1. c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where she has worked since 2002. She held a security clearance from about 2003 until it was revoked because of her finances in 2011. She has associate\u2019s (2008), bachelor\u2019s (2012), and master\u2019s (2017) degrees. She is married with two adult children and two adult stepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 21-23; GE 1-3) The SOR alleges $15,035 owed on a charged-off auto loan; eight miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling about $12,300; and a $179 medical debt. The delinquent debts are listed on an April 2020 credit report. Applicant admitted that she owed the debts at one time, but she denied that she owed the amounts alleged in the SOR. Applicant attributed her financial problems to her and her husband\u2019s medical issues. Her husband\u2019s medical problems limit his work to a part-time basis. She is the primary provider for her family, which includes her daughter and three grandchildren who live with Applicant and her husband. She also assisted in paying the expenses for her brother\u2019s funeral in January 2020. (Tr. at 19-20, 25-28, 37, 50, 53; GE 2) Applicant contracted with a debt-resolution company in August 2019. She enrolled eleven debts, totaling $21,390, in the company\u2019s debt-resolution program (DRP). The six debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d through 1.h were included in the DRP. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges $2,583 owed to a bank. That debt is not specifically identified in the DRP, but two debts of $1,983 and $1,111 ",

She submitted documents that I marked AE \nE through L and admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where she has \nworked since 2002. She held a security clearance from about 2003 until it was revoked \nbecause of her finances in 2011. She has associate\u2019s (2008), bachelor\u2019s (2012), and \nmaster\u2019s (2017) degrees. She is married with two adult children and two adult \nstepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 21-23; GE 1-3) \nThe SOR alleges $15,035 owed on a charged-off auto loan; eight miscellaneous \ndelinquent debts totaling about $12,300; and a $179 medical debt. The delinquent debts \nare listed on an April 2020 credit report. Applicant admitted that she owed the debts at \none time, but she denied that she owed the amounts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her and her husband\u2019s medical \nissues. Her husband\u2019s medical problems limit his work to a part-time basis. She is the \nprimary provider for her family, which includes her daughter and three grandchildren \nwho live with Applicant and her husband. She also assisted in paying the expenses for \nher brother\u2019s funeral in January 2020. (Tr. at 19-20, 25-28, 37, 50, 53; GE 2) \nApplicant contracted with a debt-resolution company in August 2019. She \nenrolled eleven debts, totaling $21,390, in the company\u2019s debt-resolution program \n(DRP). The six debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d through 1.h were included in the \nDRP. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges $2,583 owed to a bank. That debt is not specifically identified \nin the DRP, but two debts of $1,983 and $1,111 to the same bank are in the DRP. The \nevidence supports that the SOR \u00b6 1.c debt, or a refinanced version of the debt, is in the \nDRP. The $15,035 charged-off auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $685 charged-off debt to a \nbank (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and the $179 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j) were not included in the DRP. \nThere were three debts in the DRP totaling $11,083 that were not alleged in the SOR.1 \n(Tr. at 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4, 5; AE C, D) \nApplicant agreed to deposit $338 per month into an escrow account with the \ndebt-settlement company. The company agreed to negotiate settlements with her \ncreditors and use the accumulated funds in the escrow account, minus their fees, to pay \nthe settlements. In addition to their start-up and monthly fees, the company would earn \nfees based on the amount of any debt that was settled. (AE C, D) \nApplicant stated that her debts were not delinquent when she contracted with the \ndebt-settlement company. She did not understand the DRP. She thought it was a \nconsolidation loan that would pay her creditors, and she would pay the loan. She did not \nrealize that her accounts went into a past-due delinquent status. She continued with the \n1  Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes.

Applicant established that she consistently paid \nthe $338 monthly payments since the DRP\u2019s inception. (Tr. at 19-20, 28-30; AE E-I) \nIn June 2021, Applicant took out a consolidation loan of $12,018 through the \ndebt-resolution company. The annual interest rate is 25.24%. Applicant did not receive \nthe funds; the funds were to be disbursed to the creditors in the DRP, minus the \ncompany\u2019s fees. In June 2021, the company credited drafts totaling about $5,771 from \nthe loan to her DRP. The company paid $4,727 to six creditors, and debited $724 in \nsettlement fees. In July 2021, the company credited drafts totaling about $5,084 from \nthe loan to her DRP. The company paid $4,602 to three creditors, and debited $1,530 in \nsettlement fees. The eleven debts in the DRP, including the seven debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h are either settled and paid or in the process of being settled and \npaid. (AE E-H, J-L) \nApplicant earns about $32,000 annually. Her husband works part-time, and her \ndaughter works and contributes to the household. In addition to her DRP payments, \nApplicant is current on her $1,622 monthly mortgage payments. She has about \n$163,000 in deferred student loans. The $15,035 charged-off auto loan was taken out in \nabout October 2016. Applicant stated that she and her husband bought the vehicle for \nbetween $30,000 and $40,000, and it was voluntarily repossessed one to three years \nafter the purchase. She and her husband are current on two auto loans. They pay $674 \nper month on an auto loan of about $36,500 that was taken out in March 2018; and they \npay $871 per month on a $47,500 auto loan that was taken out in March 2019. The July \n2021 credit report lists delinquent telecommunications debts of $2,039 and $554. \nApplicant stated that she would add the remaining debts alleged in the SOR and the two \ntelecommunications debts to the DRP. (Tr. at 29, 37-42, 47-54; GE 4, 5; AE E, F) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nMarch 2020. Under the investigations and clearance record questions, she failed to \nreport that she was previously granted a security clearance and that it was revoked in \n2011. She reported one delinquent debt under the financial questions. She also \nreported that she was utilizing a \u201ccredit counseling service or other similar resource to \nresolve [her] financial difficulties,\u201d with the following explanation: \n[Debt-settlement company] has provided a non-credit based consolidation \noption, that consolidates my debts into one lower payment.

(Tr. at 30-36; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR) After considering all of the evidence, I conclude that Applicant did not \nintentionally falsify the SF 86. \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to her excellent job performance and strong \nmoral character. She is praised for her trustworthiness, reliability, professionalism, \ndedication, and judgment. (AE A, B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a charged-off auto loan, \ndelinquent consumer debts, and an unpaid medical debt. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her and her husband\u2019s medical \nissues and being the primary provider in her family. She contracted with a debt-\nresolution company in August 2019, almost a year and a half before the SOR was \nissued. She consistently paid the $338 monthly payments since the DRP\u2019s inception. In \nJune 2021, she took out a consolidation loan of $12,018 through the debt-resolution \ncompany. In effect, she substituted one form of indebtedness (credit card debt) for \nanother form (a consolidation loan) or, looking at it in a different way, she converted old \ndebt into new debt. The eleven debts in the DRP, including the seven debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h are either settled and paid or in the process of being settled \nand paid. \nIf Applicant\u2019s finances were otherwise in order, this would be a case that could be \nfound in her favor. However, I simply cannot make the math work in her favor. She is \nthe primary provider for her family with an annual salary of about $32,000. She has the \nconsolidation loan that has to be paid; a $1,622 monthly mortgage payment; $1,545 in \nmonthly auto-loan payments; and about $163,000 in deferred student loans that will \nhave to be paid at some point. Applicant\u2019s car purchases are of particular concern. The \n$15,035 charged-off auto loan in the SOR was taken out in about October 2016 for a \nvehicle that cost between $30,000 and $40,000. Within a short period before or after \nthat vehicle\u2019s repossession, she and her husband bought two more vehicles for about \n$36,500 and $47,500. To Applicant\u2019s credit, she is current on her mortgage loan and the \ntwo auto loans. The fact that something has to give is evidenced by the two delinquent \ntelecommunications debts. \nI am concluding the seven debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h, which were \neither settled and paid or in the process of being settled and paid through the DRP, in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. I am also concluding the small medical debt in her favor. The $15,035 \ncharged-off auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and the $685 charged-off debt to a bank (SOR \u00b6 1.i) \nremain unresolved. \nI am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within \na reasonable period. It is more likely that they will worsen. They continue to cast doubt \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information on the March 2020 SF 86. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. Personal conduct security concerns are concluded for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude personal conduct \nsecurity concerns were not established, but Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of January 25, 2021, Applicant was past due $2,530 on a loan balance of $9,678 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he owed charged-off debts of $20,337 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $17,877 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $3,688 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Item 1.) When he answered the SOR allegations, Applicant stated that he had not been delinquent on the accounts before he sought debt-consolidation assistance from a company that told him to close the accounts and stop making payments because the company would be handling settlements and payments for him. He asserted that he started a debt-relief program in February 2019; that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c had been resolved; and that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.b would be paid off by March 2021 and October 2021, respectively. 3 Applicant\u2019s admissions to the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are accepted and incorporated in the record as factual findings. After considering the FORM, consisting of Items 1 through 8, and Applicant\u2019s FORM Response, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 51-years-old, married, and the father of a teenage daughter. Applicant reports that he served honorably in the U.S. military from May 1997 to November 2010, and was a staff sergeant from December 2008 until his discharge. Applicant held a DOD security clearance, up to the level of top secret, while on active duty. (Item 4.)

He settled three of the debts through a debt-relief \nprogram. In December 2020, he made a lump-sum payment of $17,892 to resolve the \nother debt. Clearance eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 25, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The \nDCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective June 8, 2017, applicable to all adjudications for national security eligibility or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn February 5, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. The Government submitted a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) consisting of eight exhibits marked as Items, including the SOR (Item 1) \nand Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant on March 19, 2021, and instructed him that any response was due within 30 days \nof receipt. Applicant received the FORM on March 26, 2021, and he responded on April 11, \n2021. On April 12, 2021, the Government indicated it did not object to the inclusion of his \nFORM Response in the record. \nOn May 17, 2021, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on May 24, 2021. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 5 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on June 19, 2020, by an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The summary \nreport was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 \nE3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence \nand considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following notice regarding Item 5: \nThe enclosed summary of your Personal Subject Interview (Exhibit 5) is \nbeing provided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as part of \nthe record evidence in this case. In your response to this [FORM], you \ncan comment on whether the summary accurately reflects the \ninformation you provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you \nmay make any corrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary \nto make the summary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you may object \non the ground that the report is unauthenticated by a Government \nwitness and the document may not be considered as evidence.

Pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, but they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) (holding \nthat it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection had been \nwaived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to object). \nApplicant was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \n\u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe summary of his PSI, to comment on the summary, and to make any corrections, \ndeletions, or updates to the information in the report. When Applicant responded to the \nFORM, he did not object to the FORM or indicate that the PSI summary contained \ninaccurate information. Furthermore, Government officials are entitled to a presumption of \nregularity in the discharge of their official responsibilities. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018), and there is nothing in the record to indicate the summary \ncontains information that was inaccurate or contrary to what Applicant reported. \nApplicant can reasonably be held to have read the PSI summary, and there is no \nevidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file any objections to the summary if \nhe did not want the administrative judge to consider it. I find that Applicant waived any \nobjections to the PSI summary. FORM Items 1 through 8, including the PSI, and \nApplicant\u2019s FORM Response are accepted into the record for my consideration, subject to \nissues of relevance and materiality in the assessment of whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of January 25, 2021, Applicant was past due $2,530 on a \nloan balance of $9,678 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he owed charged-off debts of $20,337 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b), $17,877 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $3,688 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Item 1.) When he answered the \nSOR allegations, Applicant stated that he had not been delinquent on the accounts before \nhe sought debt-consolidation assistance from a company that told him to close the \naccounts and stop making payments because the company would be handling settlements \nand payments for him. He asserted that he started a debt-relief program in February 2019; \nthat the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c had been resolved; and that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.b would be paid off by March 2021 and October 2021, respectively. \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are accepted and \nincorporated in the record as factual findings. After considering the FORM, consisting of \nItems 1 through 8, and Applicant\u2019s FORM Response, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 51-years-old, married, and the father of a teenage daughter. Applicant \nreports that he served honorably in the U.S. military from May 1997 to November 2010, \nand was a staff sergeant from December 2008 until his discharge. Applicant held a DOD \nsecurity clearance, up to the level of top secret, while on active duty. (Item 4.) Available \nservice records reflected discrepant information about a reserve enlistment in February \n2012 and general discharge under honorable conditions in September 2014, which he \ndenies. He explained to an OPM investigator during his June 2020 PSI that he had \nattempted to re-enlist but was denied for medical reasons, and that his service record is \ninaccurate in some aspects. (Item 5.) \nApplicant was unemployed from December 2010 to June 2013, while pursuing his \nundergraduate degree online. He supported himself in part on Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) education benefits. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2013, and in July \n2013, he started his current employment in computer support with a defense contractor. \n(Items 4-5.) He states that he has held a security clearance for \u201cover 23 years.\u201d (Item 3.) \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May \n27, 2020. In response to an SF 86 financial record inquiry concerning whether he was \ncurrently seeking assistance for financial difficulties, Applicant disclosed that he was on a \n\u201cdebt consolidation\u201d program, and explained: \nI went in the program with no delinquency with 2 loans and 2 credit cards. I \nam currently paying semi-monthly payments to the agency which they are \nworking with the creditors. I have recently completed resolving and paying off \none of the loans. This program is really helping me get back to financial \nstability. I am currently in good standing with all my expenses and bills which \nI just completed paying off one of my car[s]. (Item 4.) \nAs of June 10, 2020, Applicant had four delinquent accounts on his credit record. An \nunsecured loan obtained for $8,910 in November 2018 became delinquent in April 2019 \nand was $2,530 past due on a balance of $9,678 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A credit-card account \nopened with a retailer in April 2017 became delinquent in April 2019 and was charged off \nfor $20,337 in October 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). A joint unsecured loan opened by Applicant and \nhis spouse with a credit union in December 2017 was charged off for $17,877 in \nSeptember 2019 after no payments since March 2019. The creditor filed a lawsuit against \nApplicant and his spouse for the debt on July 1, 2019. (Item 8.) As of April 2020, the \ncreditor was reporting an outstanding balance of $21,633 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). A credit-card \naccount Applicant opened in December 2017 was charged off. As of May 2020, the \ncreditor was reporting a balance of $3,688 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Items 6-7.)

As of May 2020, the loan balance was $20,053. In October \n2019, he paid off a $15,935 auto loan obtained in July 2014. He had been past due 30 \ndays three times on that loan. (Item 6.) \nWhen asked about his finances during his June 19, 2020 PSI, Applicant explained \nthat he and his spouse wanted to become debt free in preparation for retirement, so in the \nsummer [sic] of 2019, he began a debt-consolidation program. The debt-resolution \ncompany told him to stop payments on the accounts in the program. He understood from \nthe debt-resolution company that his credit report would reflect past-due balances while the \ncompany negotiated settlements with his creditors. Applicant asserted that he was paying \nthe debt-resolution company $767 a month in return for the company disbursing payments \nto the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. However, available information shows that the creditor \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c sought a judgment against Applicant and his spouse in July 2019. (Item 8.) If \nthat debt had been initially enrolled in the program, the creditor was unwilling to accept a \nnegotiated settlement. Applicant characterized his financial situation as good otherwise, \nand he expressed the willingness and ability to repay his past-due debts. He presented no \ndocumentation to the investigator regarding the status of the delinquent accounts, even \nthough he was provided an opportunity to do so both during and after his interview. (Item \n5.) \nOn December 23, 2020, Applicant and his spouse paid $17,892 in full settlement of \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c outside of the debt-relief program. (Item 3.) On January 8, 2021, the \ncreditor moved to dismiss its case against Applicant and his spouse. A jury trial scheduled \nfor July 7, 2021, was vacated. (Item 8.) As of March 12, 2021, Equifax was reporting the \ndebt as \u201cpaid charge off\u201d in January 2021 with a zero balance. (Item 7.) \nOn January 25, 2021, the DCSA issued an SOR to Applicant because of the \ndelinquencies on two credit-card accounts and two unsecured loans. (Item 1.) When \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 5, 2021, he reiterated that he had not been \ndelinquent in his payments before he entered the debt-relief program in February 2019, \nand that he had stopped paying on the accounts on the advice of the debt-resolution firm. \nHe indicated that he had paid off the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, and that the other two \ndebts were being repaid through the debt-relief program into which he was then paying \n$549 semi-monthly. He stated that he had learned from that situation, was living within his \nmeans and wiser in managing his debts. Applicant provided documentation from the debt-\nresolution company confirming he had enrolled in a debt-relief program on February 8, \n2019, and, as of February 4, 2021, he was \u201cscheduled to make regular deposits of $549\u201d \nfor the purpose of paying off his enrolled debts (then SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b and 1.d). Payment \nrecords from the debt-relief program show that he was offered a settlement of $2,864 on \nMay 24, 2019, to resolve the $9,548 balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and that the debt \nwas resolved through payments from June 2019 through April 2020. He also provided \ndocumentation showing that he had paid $17,892 outside the program in full settlement of \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Item 3.) \nAs of March 2021, the unsecured loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was no longer on \nApplicant\u2019s credit record.

The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d was reporting a balance of $1,771 on Applicant\u2019s \ncharged-off account with the creditor. Applicant was continuing to make timely payments \non a car loan obtained in March 2017, and he had reduced the balance to $16,213. He had \nonly one other outstanding credit balance, which was for $842 on credit-card account that \nhas been current. No balance was owed on his newest credit-card account, which he had \nopened in February 2020. (Item 7.) \nIn its FORM, the Government acknowledged Applicant\u2019s settlement of the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, but submits that Applicant did not make a good-faith effort to address \nhis debts by \u201cstrategically defaulting on the [four SOR] debts to negotiate terms that were \nmore to his favor than the existing terms because he and his wife wanted to become debt \nfree so that they could plan for retirement.\u201d (FORM) \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant provided another copy of the debt-resolution \nfirm\u2019s records showing the settlement of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for 30% of its balance. He \nalso provided records showing that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d agreed to settle for $2,367 \n(60% of the balance at settlement) on March 10, 2020, and that the debt was settled in full \nthrough payments between March 27, 2020, and February 26, 2021. Additionally, the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b agreed on August 28, 2020, to settle Applicant\u2019s $20,337 balance for \n$10,169 (50% of the balance). Between September 11, 2020 and April 8, 2021, payments \ntotaling $9,322 ($852 on September 11, 2020, $847 monthly from October 2020 through \nMarch 2021, and $4,235 on April 8, 2021) were made toward the debt. Applicant asserted \nin his FORM response that the debt has been \u201cresolved early [and is] pending status \nchange April 8, 2021.\u201d A record from the debt-resolution company shows \u201c8/8 Scheduled \nPayments,\u201d but also the debt phase as \u201cin process.\u201d Seven payments of the scheduled \neight show on Applicant\u2019s account with the debt-relief company as of April 8, 2021. (FORM \nResponse.) \nApplicant and his family lived with his in-laws from December 2014 through June \n2018. They have rented an apartment since then. (Item 4.) Applicant provided no \ninformation about his income or monthly expenses. The monthly obligation on his car loan \nis $528. He has been consistent in paying that amount or a little more. His credit report \nshows an actual payment of $530. (Item 7.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAvailable credit reports show that the accounts in the SOR first became delinquent \nin January 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), March 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and April 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b). He entered into a debt-relief program in February 2019, and asserts that he relied on \nthe advice of the debt-resolution company when he stopped paying on the accounts. Even \nso, the delinquencies establish the security concerns set forth in AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying condition triggers consideration of the \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. Four of the seven mitigating conditions could apply in \nwhole or in part. They are: \n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply because Applicant defaulted on the accounts in \nthe SOR too recently. There is also no indication that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.

The concerns about Applicant settling debts on terms advantageous to him \nare legitimate in that it shows a tendency to act in self-interest. The Government must be \nassured that an applicant will fulfill his or her obligations as a clearance holder, even when \nit may be personally inconvenient, disadvantageous, or difficult. He asserts that he acted \non the advice of the debt-resolution company in stopping his payments on his accounts. \nDates of delinquency are consistent with his explanation (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c in April 2019 and \n\u00b6 1.d in March 2019), although there is no documentation showing that the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b was ever enrolled in the debt-relief program, notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s SF 86 \nassertion to the contrary. In Applicant\u2019s favor, his financial situation appears to be stable. \nHe made timely payments on his credit accounts before 2019, and he is not currently past \ndue on his open credit accounts. He paid off a car loan according to terms in October 2019 \nand has never been late in making his payments of $528 per month on a car loan obtained \nin February 2019. His financial situation no longer presents an unacceptable security \nconcern. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nspouse voluntarily sought a legal means to possibly reduce their debt balances so that they \nwould be in a better position financially for retirement planning purposes. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(d), Department Counsel has a legitimate concern in that \nsettlement for less than the full balance benefits the debtor to the detriment of the creditor. \nApplicant only repaid a percentage of the credit extended to him with respect to the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b and 1.d. He settled those debts for $15,400. Those debts had an \naggregate balance of $29,256 when they were enrolled in the debt-relief program. He paid \n$17,892 outside the debt-relief program to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which was a little \nmore than the $17,877 charged off by the creditor. Debts settled at a significant reduction \ndo not carry as much weight in mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) as had Applicant entered into \ngood-faith repayment plans for the full balances. Applicant has a stronger case for \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) in that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, and possibly 1.b, \nhave been fully resolved. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, the last reported payment of \n$4,235 on the debt-resolution company\u2019s record may well be a lump-sum payment to pay \noff the settlement early. Recorded payments are $847 short of the $10,169 negotiated \nsettlement, which equals one monthly scheduled payment. Applicant\u2019s documented track \nrecord of payments under the debt-relief program provides an adequate guarantee that he \nwill make that payment to resolve the debt, if he has not done so already. It is unclear \nwhether Applicant has had financial counseling, which is required for full mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(c). \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather, it involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 17, 2015). \nLittle is known about Applicant\u2019s current income or living expenses. That said, he has a \nrecord of recent but not longstanding delinquency. The Government\u2019s case for an \nunwillingness to satisfy debts is not established because Applicant was enrolled in a debt-\nrelief program when he defaulted on the accounts. The primary concern in this case is with \nhis elimination of debt through negotiated settlements that resulted in him not fully repaying \nthe credit extended to him. While the Government has legitimate concerns in that regard, \nhe chose a legal means to address his debts, and the creditors (such as the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c) could have refused to settle. The security clearance adjudication is also not \nintended to punish an applicant for previous shortcomings or mistakes. Applicant attests \nthat he has learned from the situation and is managing his finances more wisely. Based on \nthe record before me, I conclude that he has adequately mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified his answers when \ncompleting his security clearance applications (SCA) in April 2011 and March 2016, when \nhe failed to disclose his marijuana use within the last seven years on those SCAs. \nApplicant acknowledged that he used all the illegal substances alleged in the SOR \nand at times when he held a security clearance. He denied deliberately making any false \nstatements when completing his 2011 and 2016 SCAs. (Items 2, 4 (section II, Drug Use, \nquestion 1)) \nApplicant first used marijuana in 2010. He claims this use was in a country where \nit was legal at the time of his use. Between 2018 and 2020 he used marijuana by smoking \nit using a vape pen and eating edibles approximately 25 times. His last use of marijuana \nwas in May 2020. His use was with his roommate, who also provided the marijuana. He \nclaims these uses were all in states that legalized marijuana under state law. He \nacknowledged knowing marijuana use is illegal under federal law. He used Ecstasy one \ntime in April 2020. He used Ecstasy with his roommate and three other acquaintances. \nHe ingested it by drinking it in a powder form. He stated that he does not intend to use \neither marijuana or Ecstasy in the future. He did not provide any information on whether \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nhe still has contacts with the roommate and acquaintances he described above.

In response to a question asking about \nhis illegal drug use in the past seven years, he answered in the negative. Applicant \nasserts that his only marijuana use at that point in time was in 2010 while he was visiting \na foreign country where such use was legal. He believes his answer to this SCA question \nwas not false because he did not engage in \u201cillegal\u201d drug usage, since it was legal under \nthe laws of the country where he used it. (Items 2, 6) \nApplicant completed a second SCA in March 2016. In response to a question \nasking about his illegal drug use in the past seven years, he answered in the negative. \nApplicant never really asserted a reason why he answered \u201cno\u201d to this question, other \nthan explaining his use in a foreign country in 2010 and asserting that the question was \nconfusing to him. He also pointed out that in his most recent SCA (July 2020) he listed all \nof his illegal drug usage. (Items 2, 3, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaw (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant first used marijuana in approximately 2010 and resumed his use of \nmarijuana in 2018 through May 2020 over 20 more times. He used Ecstasy one time in \nApril 2020. He held a security clearance from 2016, so many of his uses came while \nholding a security clearance. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was relatively frequent since 2018 and as recent as May \n2020. His use of Ecstasy was experimental, but was recent (April 2020) and was done \nwhile he held a security clearance. While he denied that he intended to use illegal drugs \nin the future, he did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all future \nillegal drug use upon penalty of losing his clearance. Additionally, we have no information \nas to whether he has distanced himself from his drug-using acquaintances, one of whom \nwas his roommate. Given his recent pattern of use of marijuana and Ecstasy while holding \na security clearance, his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are called \ninto question. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nApplicant claims his only drug use between 2010 and 2018 was when he used \nmarijuana while visiting a foreign country where such use is legal under the country\u2019s \nlaws. The Government\u2019s only evidence of Applicant\u2019s drug use comes from his own \nadmissions. Therefore, when he denied any illegal drug use between 2011 and 2018, we \nmust give that denial proper weight. The only \u201cillegal\u201d use then that is applicable to the \nquestions contained in both his SCAs from 2011 and 2016 is his use in the foreign country \nin 2010. Applicant believed this use was legal under the laws of the country where he \nused it, thus he had no intent to deliberately falsify this information on either SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s full disclosure of his past drug-use history on his 2020 SCA lends credibility \nto Applicant\u2019s statement about his intent when he completed the earlier SCAs. The \nevidence does not establish a deliberate falsification or omission on either the 2011 or \n2016 SCAs. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s statement of \nintent of no future use. However, I also considered that he used marijuana on numerous \noccasions and Ecstasy as recently as 2020, while holding a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, but the disqualifying conduct was not established \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   2.a - 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The transcript was received on July \n28, 2021. The Government submitted GE 5 into the post-hearing record relating to the \nfederal student loan rehabilitation program, which was accepted into the record without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 35, is single and has no children. (Tr.16) He obtained his \nundergraduate degree in 2008. (Tr. 22) He obtained a master\u2019s degree in 2016. Applicant \ncompleted his security clearance application on November 6, 2018. He has not held a \nsecurity clearance in the past. (GE 1) He is being sponsored for a security clearance by \na defense contractor. (GE 1) He has no military experience. He has been currently \nunemployed since February 2020. (Tr. 39) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the Department of Education for a \ncollection account in the amount of $73,991. (1.a); and is indebted to a cable company in \ncollection for approximately $2,807. (1.b) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations 1.a and \n1.b. \nApplicant acknowledged the delinquent debts. He attributes his debts for both \naccounts to unemployment and temporary jobs. He admits that his largest debts are the \nstudent loans and has recently made a payment arrangement to liquidate the student \nloans. (Answer) As to the collection account cable bill in the amount of $2,807, Applicant \npaid the account on February 24, 2021. (Attachment to answer) Applicant also attached \nhis 2017 and 2018 tax returns with his answer. \nAfter his graduation, Applicant worked as a substitute teacher for the past 12 years \nmaking $100 a day. (Tr.22) He coached high school football for several years. Also, he \nworked for his brother\u2019s fitness company as a personal trainer ($25 an hour) with students \nwith special needs. He stated that he did this work for 13 years in conjunction with the \nsubstitute teaching. (Tr. 22) \nIn February 2020, Applicant was relieved from his teaching duties due to COVID. \nHe did not receive any Government assistance until June 2020. (Tr. 23) During that time, \nhe earned a security plus certification to help get a position with IT. He was hired on \nNovember 2020. (Tr. 23) His parents helped him financially. (AE B, C) \nApplicant acknowledged that after he completed his master\u2019s degree in 2016, \nstudent loan billings of $30,000, began to appear. He acknowledged that he ignored them \nand was irresponsible. He stated that he made a $600 payment toward the student loans \nin 2018 or 2019 to a loan forgiveness organization to help negotiate a lower balance and \nlower monthly payments, but did not follow up with the organization. He does not \nremember the name of the organization. (Tr. 23, GE 3, GE 2) He stated that due to his \nlimited finances, he was not able to maintain any payments. He also acknowledged that \nhe was immature. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s 2019-2020 investigative interview, he stated that he would \ncontact the creditors in order to resolve the delinquent accounts. Applicant stated that he \nlives within his means and pays all of his bills. He wants to have good credit and \u201cbe better \nfinancially.\u201d (GE 2) He wants a better paying job so that he can pay off his debts. (GE 2) \nHis credit bureau report of March 10, 2020 reflects that he had other accounts that he \npaid as agreed. (GE 4) He has no new consumer debts. (Tr. 42) \nApplicant received his SOR in 2021 and understood the significance and the \nreason for his denial of a security clearance. He paid the cable debt as referenced above. \n(Tr. 24) He stated that the other student loans were up to date. (GE 3) \nApplicant presented a loan repayment agreement that explained each of the \ndefaulted federal education loans, showing a defaulted loan balance of $73,908.54. (AE \nA) The repayment agreement is dated July 2, 2021. It does not show any payments made. \nHe stated that he pays $5 a month for rehabilitation of his loans and take them out of \ndefault. (Tr. 34) However, the starting date is July 24, 2021. (Tr. 36) At the hearing, \nApplicant stated that he started the payments in March. He did not have any \ndocumentation to corroborate his payment claims. Applicant also stated that he owes \n$3,500 to the state relating to unemployment, which he has disputed. (Tr. 40) \nApplicant submitted letters of reference from his parents who detail his difficulty \nwith finding a job with a steady income, forcing him to struggle with his bills. The parents \ncontinue to support their son emotionally and financially. (AE B, C) Applicant\u2019s parents \ndescribe him as loyal and trustworthy. He had a scholarship for his undergraduate degree, \nbut used student loans for his master\u2019s degree in 2016. (AE C) \nApplicant provided two more letters of recommendation from others who have \nknown Applicant his entire life. One letter stated that Applicant was \u201ctoo embarrassed to \nask his family and friends to help him financially, when he was unemployed for a \nsignificant amount of time after graduation.\u201d (AE D, E) \nIn his post-hearing submissions, Applicant provided a current budget, dated July \n31, 2021. (AE F) He showed a monthly net income of $1,760 and total monthly expenses \nof $2,630. He listed his payment of $5 for the student loan program, which has a balance \nof $73,904. He explained he lived in his parents\u2019 home and rented rooms to close friends. \n(Tr. 45) His car note is paid. (Tr. 47) \nAlso, in Applicant\u2019s post-hearing packet, he provided information concerning his \n2020 federal tax returns and his wage sheet from the substitute teaching. He also \nprovided his state tax income return. (AE F) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling\nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit\ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that he had two delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$78,807.

The student loans represent money \nthat Applicant borrowed in 2016-2018 for his graduate studies. Applicant admitted that \nhe made only one payment of $600 in 2018. He ignored the student loan issue for many \nyears. However, he was credible in his explanations that his failure to pay was also a \nresult of lack of means to pay and financial hardship since graduating in 2018. He recently \nentered into a rehabilitation program. He submitted no proof that he has actually made \n$5 payments for the past several months. \nApplicant has done little to rectify the student loan situation until recently and did \nnot provide the exact agreement he entered into for the rehabilitation program, despite \nthe fact that the record was left open for further submissions. He did not receive financial \ncounseling. Although, he was unemployed or had underemployment, he did not act \nresponsibly in this situation or make good-faith efforts to repay the student loans. His \nunemployment does appear to be a circumstance that occurred beyond his control due \nto unemployment, but he acknowledged that he did not act responsibly and was \nimmature. Applicant recently began a plan of rehabilitating his student loans and has \nresolved the other consumer debt in 2021. However, there is no track record to support \nmitigation in this case. None of the mitigating conditions apply. There is no evidence to \nshow that Applicant has made a consistent or concerted effort to resolve any of his \nfinancial issues except for his recent involvement with the two debts. \nApplicant has not acted responsibly and was not proactive until after receipt of the \nSOR. Without documentary evidence of more efforts to address his student loans, he has \nnot demonstrated a track record of payment initiative, and there is no indication that his \nfinancial situation is under control. AG \u00b6 20(a)-20(d) and 20(g) are not established. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent student debts remain delinquent and in rehabilitation. He has not \nmet his burden of proof in this case. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s unemployment and desire to repay his student \nloans, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nfinancial indebtedness. I conclude that it is not in the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since graduating from college in May 2010. He was granted a security clearance in September 2010 and is now seeking to renew his clearance. In 2015, he earned a master\u2019s degree, and he married in 2016. The couple have one child. (FORM Item 4.) In his SCA, Applicant advised that after being granted eligibility for a security clearance, he used marijuana about five times during the period July 2011 to June 2019. In his September 2020 background interview, he repeated this information, including the June 2019 date of his last use of marijuana, and the investigator reported it in his/her Report of Investigation. For a third time, he repeated in his February 18, 2021 Answer the same dates of his use of marijuana. In his Response to Department Counsel\u2019s FORM, Applicant wrote that he misspoke during his background interview and that his last use of marijuana was June 2018, one year earlier. He also corrected the spelling of the name of a town appearing in the Investigator\u2019s report in which he once used marijuana. (FORM Item 1 at 5; FORM Item 2 at 45; FORM Item 3 at 1; Response.)

He admitted the single allegation in the \nSOR and requested a decision based upon the administrative record without a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 26, 2021, Department Counsel sent to Applicant a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) with four proposed exhibits, Items 1-4, attached. Applicant responded to the \nFORM on June 3, 2021 (Response). Applicant raised no objection in his Response to any \nof the Government\u2019s proposed exhibits, including FORM Item 3, which is a summary of \nhis September 24, 2021 background interview. In his FORM, Department Counsel had \nadvised Applicant in his FORM that Applicant had the right to object to the admission of \nthis exhibit into the record or he could provide corrections and updates. Applicant did not \nobject, but instead chose to provide two corrections to the summary, one of which was \nrelevant to the issues in this case. \nOn July 16, 2021, the case was assigned to me. Subject to Applicant\u2019s \nmodifications and in the absence of any objections, I have admitted into the record FORM \nItem 3 and the three other evidentiary items attached to Department Counsel\u2019s FORM. \nApplicant\u2019s Response is also admitted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since graduating \nfrom college in May 2010. He was granted a security clearance in September 2010 and \nis now seeking to renew his clearance. In 2015, he earned a master\u2019s degree, and he \nmarried in 2016. The couple have one child. (FORM Item 4.) \nIn his SCA, Applicant advised that after being granted eligibility for a security \nclearance, he used marijuana about five times during the period July 2011 to June 2019. \nIn his September 2020 background interview, he repeated this information, including the \nJune 2019 date of his last use of marijuana, and the investigator reported it in his/her \nReport of Investigation. For a third time, he repeated in his February 18, 2021 Answer the \nsame dates of his use of marijuana. In his Response to Department Counsel\u2019s FORM, \nApplicant wrote that he misspoke during his background interview and that his last use of \nmarijuana was June 2018, one year earlier. He also corrected the spelling of the name of \na town appearing in the Investigator\u2019s report in which he once used marijuana. (FORM \nItem 1 at 5; FORM Item 2 at 45; FORM Item 3 at 1; Response.) \nThe details of Applicant\u2019s admitted use of marijuana are that he and his wife \ntraveled to two states in which marijuana could be legally purchased under the laws of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthose states and used marijuana a total of four times.

He was also aware that \nmarijuana was not legal under Federal law. He wrote that recognized now that he \nexercised poor judgment in using marijuana after having been granted a security \nclearance. He reported his misconduct on his SCA and to the Government investigator in \nan effort to be transparent and to demonstrate that he was honest and trustworthy. He \nwrote in his Answer that he promised never to use marijuana in the future and that since \nhis last use, he has matured and is now a father of a young child. He recognizes the \nresponsibilities that having a serious job as a government contractor entails as well as \nthe responsibilities he has to his family. (FORM Item 3 at 2; Answer at 5; Response.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability with \ntheir intended purpose can raise questions about a person\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his Answer establishes the following conditions under AG \n\u00b6 25 that could be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement and substance misuse. Two of these mitigating \nconditions have possible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s behavior is quite recent. His \nlast use was either in June 2019 or June 2018. In the absence of a hearing at which I \ncould assess Applicant\u2019s credibility of his testimony, I cannot find that he established that \nhis most recent use of marijuana was in June 2018, as he now writes. I conclude that the \nJune 2019 date is more likely, given other record evidence. Applicant disclosed this date \nin his July 2020 SCA, only a little more than one year after the date provided. He repeated \nthat date two more times, first in his September 2020 background interview (though he \nhas now changed it) and again in his February 2021 Answer. It was only after he received \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM that he changed this date of last use to one year earlier. \nUnder these circumstances, I do not find his change of dates to be believable. As a result, \nit has only been about two years since Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana. After an eight-\nyear period of admitted use, that is not sufficiently remote in time to permit a conclusion \nthat it is unlikely to recur. Moreover, even if his last use of marijuana was, in fact, in June \n2018, as he now says, that would also be too recent under the circumstances, even if it \nis less so. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted use of marijuana was infrequent over an eight-year period, \nbut it did not involve any unusual circumstances. He used the drug with his wife while \nrelaxing on a trip and with friends on a golf course. Most importantly, Applicant\u2019s admitted \npoor judgment in using marijuana when he knew that it was illegal to do so under Federal \nlaw casts doubt his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Regardless of \nwhether his last use of marijuana was about two years ago or three years ago, Applicant \nexercised extremely bad judgment using marijuana over a seven or eight-year period, \neven though infrequently, while he held a security clearance. His actions cast doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially established. Applicant acknowledges his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. After his last use, he decided to abstain and has \npromised that he will never again betray his responsibilities as a security clearance holder \nand violate the law. He has established a relatively brief pattern of abstinence, but he has \nnot provided any evidence that he has dissociated himself from his drug-using friends. Of \ncourse, his most frequent drug-using associate was his wife. He has not provided any \nevidence from his wife indicating that she has stopped using illegal drugs, just as he did \nnot provide any corroboration from his wife or anyone else to support his assertion that \nhis last use of marijuana occurred a year earlier than he had previously disclosed. \nSimilarly, he has not provided any evidence that he has changed or avoided the \nenvironment where drugs were used, which would be difficult again because one of the \nenvironments where he used marijuana was in the company of his wife. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR contains the following statement: \u201cI hereby promise \nto never use recreational marijuana nor any other banned substance that would \njeopardize the aforementioned [national security and our nation\u2019s interests].\u201d While this \nstatement is similar to a written statement pursuant to the terms of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), he \nqualifies his promise to abstain from any future use of marijuana so as to leave the door \nopen to the future use of non-recreational marijuana, such as so-called \u201cmedicinal \nmarijuana,\u201d which is also illegal under Federal law. Furthermore, his written statement \nleaves out the critical language in the guideline about the potential sanction for breaking \nhis promise to abstain, i.e., that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s promise not to use \nrecreational marijuana in the future does not fully satisfy the requirements of AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3). \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s written \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommitment to abstain from using marijuana in the future and his assertion that his job \nand family responsibilities have given him a new understanding of the importance of \ncomplying with the law and acting maturely. Because he has a young family, I can \nunderstand his sincerity in wanting to become a more mature person. He also voluntarily \ndisclosed his past marijuana use in an effort to be transparent and responsible. However, \nhis actions have not established an adequate track record of responsible, law-abiding \nbehavior. His use of marijuana while holding a security clearance is particularly telling \nregarding his lack of maturity up until two or three years ago. Also, I do not find his \nuncorroborated assertion that his last use was actually in 2018, not 2019, to be the actions \nof a mature individual. The one-year difference is not relevant to the analysis in this \ndecision, but it does suggest that Applicant still has a way to go to become a mature \nindividual. In addition, since Applicant elected not to have a hearing in this case, I did not \nhave the opportunity to observe his demeanor and assess the credibility of his assertions \nthat he sincerely regrets his past mistakes and has indeed matured into a law-abiding, \nresponsible person. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn July 17, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, and he elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 67 years old. He is a high school graduate and has certified apprentice \ncredentials. He has been married since 1983. He has been steadily employed to the \npresent, except from November 2006 to January 2007. (Item 4) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He completed a security clearance \napplication (SCA) in October 2009. In it he disclosed two delinquent credit card debts \n($1,960 and $7,654) and two judgments ($3,839 and $6,020). (Items 3, 4) \nIn January 2020, Applicant completed another SCA. In response to Section 26: \nFinancial Record, he disclosed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He stated \nthat the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($6,801); 1.d ($2,773); 1.e ($1,814); 1.f ($1,207); and 1.g \n($1,128) were personal loans that had been turned over to collection agencies. He stated \nthat each of these debts were delinquent because his wife was laid off from employment \nin July 2014. He listed the date the debts became an issue as July 2014. He further stated \nthat each debt was submitted to a debt relief company (DR) to negotiate a payoff.\u201d (Item \n3) \nApplicant further disclosed in his SCA the delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($41,795) \nfor a 2017 vehicle that he surrendered to the dealership because he was unable to make \nthe payments. He noted the financial issue began in February 2018. He said the debt was \nincurred because his wife was laid off from employment and she became permanently \ndisabled and could no longer work. The debt was turned over to DR. Applicant also \ndisclosed in his SCA the delinquent debt for medical services in SOR \u00b6 1.i and stated he \nwas unaware this debt was not covered by his medical insurance. It was submitted to DR \nto negotiate a payoff (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($448) and 1.b ($9,570) to \nthe same creditor for a time-share contract and fees associated with it. He stated: The \nreduced income from his wife\u2019s Social Security could no longer support this payment. The \nfinancial issue began in June 2019 and both debts were submitted to DR to negotiate a \npayoff.

He indicated that the reason he was unable to pay it was because his wife was \nlaid off from employment in July 2014, and it had been submitted to DR. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2021 answer to the SOR, he denied all of the SOR debts. He \nexplained that the vehicle he voluntarily surrendered to the creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was sold \nand $15,795 is the deficiency balance. Sometime after Applicant completed his SCA in \nJanuary 2020, he hired Lexington Law to dispute his debts. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nremains in a charged-off status on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. The debt is not resolved. \n(Items 2, 3, 5, 6; AE C) \nApplicant provided a response to the FORM in which he stated that his wife was \nlaid off from employment on September 30, 2017. She was then injured while searching \nfor work and was declared disabled by the Social Security Administration effective \nOctober 1, 2017. It is unknown whether Applicant\u2019s wife had two periods of unemployment \nas he indicated she was first unemployed in 2014, which caused them financial difficulties. \n(AE A, AE E). \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for a time \nshare he and his wife purchased. He stated they were pressured into the purchase. It is \nunknown when this purchase was made. He requested the contract be canceled after his \nwife became disabled. Fees associated with the time share with the same creditor are \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He is disputing both debts. In his FORM response, he stated that \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was removed from his credit report. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h remains on his \ncredit report. It is not resolved. (Item 2, AE A, AE C) \nIn Applicant\u2019s FORM response, he stated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i \nand 1.j were removed from his credit report. Applicant disclosed all of these debts as \ndelinquent in his 2020 SCA. He did not indicate if they were removed because he paid \nthem. They were reported on Applicant\u2019s March 2020 and December 2020 credit reports. \nThey do not appear on the August 2021 credit report provided by Applicant. (Items 3, 5, \n6; AE C) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s FORM response, he stated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and \n1.e are being resolved. He said that Lexington Law is working to resolve the debt for the \nrepossessed vehicle in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant stated that he spoke with the creditor for the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.c and assured him that as soon as he was done paying $340 on a credit \ncard he owed that he would begin paying this debt. He stated with regard to the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e that it is being reviewed by Lexington Law. None of these debts are resolved. \nApplicant stated in his FORM response that his \u201cdebt situation has improved and \ncontinues to improve.\u201d (AE A) He further stated that he has taken all reasonable and \nresponsible means available to him under the circumstances to resolve his debts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in 2014. He \ndisclosed in his 2020 SCA that he owed each of the debts alleged in the SOR and he was \nworking with DR to negotiate payoffs with each creditor. He then denied each debt in his \nanswer to the SOR. He has not provided evidence that he has paid any of the delinquent \ndebts he admitted he owed. Although, disputing debts may be a way to have them \nremoved from Applicant\u2019s credit report, it is clear by Applicant\u2019s admission that the debts \nare legitimate and he has chosen not to pay them. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant indicated in his 2020 SCA that his financial issues began in 2014 when \nhis wife was laid off from employment. It appears she must have resumed work sometime \nafter that because he then stated in his FORM response that she was laid off again in \nSeptember 2017. He did not provide an explanation for why he did not address his \ndelinquent debts when she resumed work. It was determined that she was permanently \ndisabled in October 2017. She receives Social Security disability payments. \nApplicant disclosed on his SCA each delinquent debt alleged in the SOR and \nstated that he was working with DR to negotiate payoffs for each. It appears he has \nabandoned that option and now denies the debts, and is disputing them through \nLexington Law. He has been able to have some of his delinquent debts removed from his \ncredit report. He indicated that Lexington Law is working to resolve the remaining debts \nor dispute them. Applicant did not provide evidence that he has paid any of the debts he \nadmitted that he owed in his SCA. Applicant did not provide evidence of a reliable financial \nrecord to show that his failure to pay his creditors will not happen in the future. His conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.

As noted above, she must have resumed work, because Applicant \nstated that she was laid off again in September 2017 and became disabled shortly \nthereafter. He did not provide any evidence of action he took to resolve the debts he noted \nbecame delinquent in 2014. Although, he has disputed and had some delinquent debts \nremoved from his credit report, others remain and have not been resolved. I find \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s unemployment in 2014 and again in 2017 was beyond his control. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his delinquent debts after his wife resumed work \nwas not acting responsibly. Although, he may be able to have debts he acknowledged he \nowed removed from his credit report, I do not find this conduct falls within the scope of \nacting responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) marginally applies. \nThere is evidence that Applicant is working with Lexington Law and it is attempting \nto remove debts from his credit report. He did not provide information about his current \nfinances. Despite working with Lexington Law, I am not convinced that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are under control. I find AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. There is no \nevidence that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay any of his creditors. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant disputed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He did not \nprovide an explanation for the basis of his disputes. He admitted and disclosed all of these \ndebts in his SCA and they are supported by credit reports. Some of his delinquent debts \nwere removed from his credit report. However, Applicant did not provide evidence that \nthe debts alleged are not legitimate. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a significant history of financial problems. When he completed his \n2009 SCA he disclosed two delinquent credit card debts and two judgments. In his 2020 \nSCA, he disclosed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He then denied each \nof the same debts in his SOR answer. He has disputed each of the debts and has been \nable to have some removed from his credit report. This may be the best financial avenue \nfor Applicant to follow to eventually put his finances in order and clear his negative credit \nhistory. However, his lengthy history of failing to maintain a reliable financial track record \nand pay his legitimate creditors is a security concern. Applicant continues to have debts \nthat he admitted he owed that remain unpaid. He failed to meet his burden of persuasion. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a-1.j \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (AE \nE) \nIn March 2013, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which was later \nconverted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2019. The bankruptcy was \ndischarged in April 2020. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) Applicant admitted this allegation and testified \nthat he was not good at managing money. He also admitted that beginning in about \n2017, he started gambling. His gambling increased to the point where he was going to \nthe casino one or two times weekly, spending approximately $400 on each occasion. \nApplicant\u2019s gambling losses eventually prevented him from continuing the Chapter 13 \npayments to the trustee, and a change was initiated by his attorney to deduct the \npayments directly from Applicant\u2019s paychecks. Applicant started relying on credit card \ncash advances and using speedy loans to pay for his gambling and living expenses. His \nfinancial situation steadily worsened and he made the decision to convert his current \nChapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2019. (Tr. 30-36, 87-88; \nGE 5, GE 6, GE 7; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s student loans totaling about $6,732 were \ndelinquent. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d) Applicant provided post-hearing documentation \ndated March 2021 showing that the combined total of his student loans was $15,210. \nThe VA also notified the U.S. Department of Education that Applicant was eligible for a \ntotal and permanent disability discharge of his federal student loans, which canceled his \nobligation to repay the remaining student loan balances. (Tr. 36-38, 40; GE 3, GE 4; AE \nF) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed two First Premier credit cards in the total \namount of $1,910 that had been charged off. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e, and 2.f.) These allegations \nwere withdrawn by Department Counsel as the debts were included in the Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge. This information was also verified by the December 2020 credit \nreport in evidence that listed both accounts with a zero balance. (Tr. 38-41; GE 3, GE 4; \nAE B, AE C) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed a Credit One Bank credit card in the \napproximate amount of $858. (SOR \u00b6 2.g) This debt was also included in the \nbankruptcy discharge. (Tr. 41-43; GE 4; AE B, AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h alleged that Applicant continued to gamble despite his delinquent \naccounts and pending bankruptcy, which he admitted in his SOR response. He testified \nthat while the bankruptcy was pending, he was experiencing some depression, and \ngambling made him feel better about himself. Applicant\u2019s stated his last visit to a casino \noccurred in July 2020. (Tr. 33-36, 48) \nIn 2019, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e confronted him about his gambling problem.

His family doctor prescribed an \nantidepressant medication (name unrecalled), but he quickly discontinued taking it after \na couple of months as he did not like how the medication made him feel. Despite being \nin treatment, in part for his gambling addiction, Applicant continued gambling because \nhe enjoyed it and believed he could responsibly control his gambling. He visited the \ncasino one to two times weekly, and he told his counselor he only wished to reduce, not \neliminate, his gambling visits. Applicant testified at the hearing he had permission from \nhis therapist to continue visiting the casino to see if he really could control his gambling. \nHe went to the casino with only $100 to see if he could control it, and he continued this \npattern until he acknowledged to the counselor that he could not control his gambling. \nHis counselor advised him that he needed to completely stop gambling and to continue \ncounseling to help him overcome his gambling addiction. After July 30, 2019, Applicant \ndid not see a counselor for his gambling disorder for over a year because his counselor \nwas on an indefinite leave of absence, and he did not want to see any other therapist for \nhis treatment. (Tr. 34, 64-65, 67-71, 84-86, 89-90; AE E) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s June 22, 2020 background interview, he volunteered to the \ninvestigator that he had a gambling addiction. Applicant reported that from August 2018 \nthrough July 2019 he lost on average $300 to $1,000 weekly due to gambling. During \nhis Chapter 13 bankruptcy when the monthly payments were being deducted from his \npaychecks, Applicant opened about six to eight credit card accounts and payday loans \nto help pay for his gambling. The credit card cash advances and payday loans totaled \nabout $14,000, and he eventually included these debts in his December 2019 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy conversion. Applicant also spent approximately $9,000 of his personal \nsavings to support his gambling addiction. He told the investigator that he received \ntreatment for his gambling addiction from July 2019 through December 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s actual dates of treatment occurred from June 6, 2019 to July 30, 2019. He \nalso reported that he stopped gambling in July 2019, and he did not anticipate that he \nwould gamble in the future. (Tr. 30-31, 34-36, 60-62, 87; GE 2, GE 8) \nIn July 2020, Applicant received a lump-sum disability back-payment of $17,000 \nfrom the VA. Applicant testified that he had resumed gambling in May or June 2020, \nand it was not until July 2020 that he realized that he did have an uncontrollable \ngambling problem, and he could never visit a casino again. He went to the casino to fill \nout an exclusionary ticket in July 2020, but he also took about $300 with him to gamble \none last time before filling out the paperwork. He won $200, completed the exclusionary \nticket, and the casino personnel escorted him to the parking lot. In August 2020, he took \nout a loan from his 401k in the amount of approximately $2,124. He could not recall the \nreason why he took out that loan, but thought possibly to purchase items for the birth of \nhis son. He is current on the bi-weekly loan payments of $56.26 since it is taken directly \nout of his paychecks. Applicant reiterated that the last time he gambled was in July \n2020. (Tr. 67-69, 73-75, 87-88; SOR response; AE G) \nOn August 22, 2020, Applicant visited another counselor because he stated that \nhe needed help to control his gambling addiction.

The 2019 treatment he received was not \nsuccessful. Applicant was diagnosed with major depression disorder, active, and \ngambling disorder, active. The treatment objective was to explore and resolve issues \nrelated to his addictive behavior, including gambling, and for Applicant to stay \ncompletely free of gambling. He was also to be referred to a psychiatrist due to his \nunderlying depression that could be contributing to his addictive behavior. Applicant was \nsupposed to contact the therapist to set up his next appointment, but he did not like this \ntherapist, and he did not return for additional treatment. The therapist opined that there \nwas a potential for Applicant\u2019s condition to adversely impact his judgment and reliability \nbecause he suffered from a lack of impulse control and did not continue any \nrecommended treatment for this condition. (Tr. 29, 32, 56-58, 65, 70-71; AE E) \nApplicant testified that in July 2020 he stopped gambling cold turkey, and without \nthe benefit of continued counseling or a gambling support group. After questioning, he \nadmitted that he had contacted the treatment center again in early 2021. When asked \nwhy he made this contact since he reportedly stopped gambling in July 2020, he said he \ndid so because he does not like being told he cannot do something or that he cannot \novercome a personal problem, such as gambling. This all started after Applicant was \nhaving a conversation with his brother-in-law, an alcoholic, and he asked him why he \ncould not just have one beer? Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law told him the reason he could \nnot have a beer is due to the same reason Applicant could not gamble again; they were \nboth addicts. Applicant stated that a part of him wanted to prove his brother-in-law \nwrong and show him he could control his gambling. So in early 2021 Applicant called a \ntherapist to see if this was a good idea, but after he could not get in touch with the \ntherapist, he decided it was not worth it. He does not intend to participate in any \nadditional counseling for his gambling problem because he does not think about \ngambling anymore. He estimated that overall he lost about $10,000 over the years due \nto gambling. (Tr. 71-72, 89-94) \nPersonal Conduct: \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified information on his January 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA) when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201cSection \n21- Psychological and Emotional Health \u2013 Adversely Affected: Do you have a mental \nhealth or other health condition that substantially adversely affects your judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness even if you are not experiencing such symptoms today?\u201d \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his 2019 diagnoses of major depressive disorder \nand gambling disorder. (SOR \u00b6 3.a) In his SOR response, Applicant denied this \nallegation, stating that he never agreed with his therapist\u2019s diagnosis of major \ndepressive disorder. He was merely going through an emotional period of his life. \nApplicant did not address or explain why he failed to disclose his diagnosis of gambling \ndisorder on the SCA. (Tr. 23-24, 63, 76-78; GE 1, GE 2, GE 8; SOR response) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified information on \nhis January 2020 SCA in his response to the following question: \u201cSection 26- Financial \nRecord \u2013 Gambling: Have you EVER experienced financial problems due to gambling?\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered this question \u201cNo\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose that he opened \nmultiple lines of credit totaling $14,000 and also spent approximately $9,000 of his \nsavings to support his gambling, which ultimately led to his filing for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in December 2019. (SOR \u00b6 3.b) Applicant admitted this information in his \nSOR response, but he denied that he answered the question with the intent to deceive \nthe government. He made a mistake when he read the question and failed to disclose \nhis financial issues developed from his gambling problem.

(Tr. 75, \n78-79; GE 1; SOR response) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe medical diagnoses and records in evidence raised the following \nPsychological Conditions Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 28: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, or \ntrustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take prescribed \nmedication or failure to attend required counseling sessions; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) pathological gambling, the associated behaviors of which may include \nunsuccessful attempts to stop gambling; gambling for increasingly higher \nstakes, usually in an attempt to cover losses; concealing gambling losses; \nborrowing or stealing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts; and \nfamily conflict resulting from gambling. \nThe SOR alleges psychological conditions security concerns based on \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 diagnoses of major depressive disorder and gambling disorder. It is \nimportant to note that he has never successfully completed a treatment program. \nApplicant claimed that he last gambled in July 2020, but he visited a therapist in August \n2020, and he admitted during that session that he continued to gamble. The therapist \nopined that there was a potential for Applicant\u2019s condition to adversely impact his \njudgment and reliability because he suffered from a lack of impulse control and did not \ncontinue any recommended treatment for this condition. The therapist recommended \nthat he continue counseling and not go to casinos, and he did comply with those \ntherapeutic recommendations. \nI considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer has indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant stated repeatedly that he last gambled in July 2020, but the records in \nevidence show that he continued to gamble after July 2020. The August 22, 2020 \ntreatment records report that he initiated treatment because he \u201chas a gambling \naddiction. He wants help to control it.\u201d He admitted during that session that he had \nstruggled with gambling for several years and had to file for bankruptcy twice (Chapter \n13 and Chapter 7) due to gambling losses. He had stopped gambling for about a year \nfollowing treatment in 2019, but admitted during his August 2020 session that he had \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstarted gambling again a few months ago. In June 2020, Applicant participated in a \nbackground interview and told the investigator that he stopped gambling in July 2019, \nand did not intend to gamble again. The current treatment records show that Applicant \ncould have been gambling at the time he had his background interview, or at the very \nleast he started gambling again immediately after he reported to the investigator that he \ndid not intend to gamble in the future. Either scenario raises security concerns. \nApplicant has not successfully completed professional treatment for his \ndiagnosed conditions, and he does not have any plans to seek mental health counseling \nin the future. In August 2020, a qualified mental health professional determined that \nApplicant\u2019s condition was not fully under control and may negatively impact his \njudgment and trustworthiness if left untreated. None of the mitigating conditions fully \napply. Psychological conditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant \nfinancial transactions to fund gambling or pay gambling debts\u201d; and \u201c(i) concealing \ngambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by gambling.\u201d The evidence \nof record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(h) and 19(i). Further inquiry about the applicability of \nmitigating conditions is required. \nThe following financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. \nApplicant provided inconsistent information about his history of gambling. He told \na counselor in August 2020 that his gambling losses caused him to file for bankruptcy \ntwice, so at the very least, he has gambled since 2013 when he initially filed for Chapter \n13 bankruptcy protection. During his Chapter 13 bankruptcy when the monthly \npayments were being deducted from his paychecks, Applicant opened about six to eight \ncredit card accounts and payday loans to help pay for his gambling. The credit card \ncash advances and payday loans totaled about $14,000, and he eventually included \nthese debts in his December 2019 Chapter 7 bankruptcy conversion, which was \ninitiated due to his worsening financial situation. He also spent approximately $9,000 of \nhis personal savings to support his gambling addiction. In 2019, after being confronted \nby his fianc\u00e9e about his gambling, he lied to her about his gambling. He only attended \ntreatment after she gave him an ultimatum to either get treatment for his gambling or \nelse their wedding would be called off. \nUncontrolled gambling has caused Applicant to experience serious financial \nproblems over the years. He has not successfully completed treatment for his \ndiagnosed conditions, and as such, his gambling addiction and financial issues are \nlikely to recur. He has not acted responsibly under the circumstances in dealing with his \ngambling disorder, and his inconsistent statements cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and use of good judgment. There are no clear indications that his \nfinances will remain stable and under control. The potential for future gambling \ncontinues to be a security concern because he failed to demonstrate a history of \nabstention from gambling. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Financial \nconditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable under the established facts in \nthis case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material information \non his SCA he completed in January 2020. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes.

Applicant did not adequately address or explain why he also failed to disclose \nhis 2019 diagnosis of gambling disorder on the SCA. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \nApplicant was asked to respond to the following question on his January 2020 \nSCA: \u201cSection 26- Financial Record \u2013 Gambling: Have you EVER experienced financial \nproblems due to gambling?\u201d He answered this question with a negative response. \nApplicant stated this was a mistake, and it was not his intent to falsify this information. \nHe merely misread the question and answered it incorrectly. The question itself is \nstraight-forward and comprehensible. In light of the two omissions on his SCA and his \ninconsistent statements during the security clearance investigation and hearing, I find \nthat Applicant is not a credible witness. Overall, Applicant\u2019s failure to be honest and \ncandid casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.

I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious concerns that \nprovides insight to a person\u2019s character and integrity. I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated security concerns raised by Guidelines I, F, and E.

(Items 2, 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to a layoff, his divorce, and his \nmother\u2019s cancer. Those events qualify as conditions that were largely beyond his \ncontrol. He stated that since he returned to work in December 2017, he has been \nworking to pay his debts. His first priority was to pay his back child support. That \naccount is current, but information about how much he had to pay to bring it current is \nlacking. I am crediting him with paying the $130 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and that \ndebt is mitigated, but that is $130 out of $52,000 in delinquent debts. He stated that he \nintends to pay his other debts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

His termination in October 2019 is alleged under Guideline F in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a and cross-alleged under Guideline E in SOR \u00b6 2.d. He was unemployed from October \n2019 until he was hired by his current employer in March 2020. \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s misuse of a company credit card, the SOR alleges seven \ndelinquent debts totaling about $8,668, three of which are delinquent student loans \ntotaling about $6,380. The debts are reflected in credit reports from August 2020 and \nJanuary 2021. (FORM Items 9 and 10) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed his \nmisuse of the company credit card and delinquent debts to the stress of dealing with his \nwife\u2019s mental breakdowns and suicide attempts. He submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling. He has not disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nThe evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: cellphone bill placed for collection of $1,292. In Applicant\u2019s answer \nto the SOR, he stated that, on April 20, 2021, he set up a payment plan with a collection \nagency providing for an initial $100 payment followed by automatic withdrawal of $50 per \nmonth from his checking account. He did not submit any documentation to support his \nstatement. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e: collection accounts for $279, $420, and $297. In \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that these debts had been paid in full on April \n20, 2021. He provided no documentation of payment. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f: student loans placed for collection of $2,295; $2,202; and $1,883. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were assigned to the Department of Education (DoEd) in \nSeptember 2016 and became delinquent in March 2018. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, he stated that he had contacted the collection agency on April 20, 2021, and set up \na payment plan providing for monthly payments of $624 on his total debt of $7,266, with \nthe first payment scheduled for April 21, 2021. He did not provide any documentation of \nthe payment plans or payments actually made. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment for misuse of a \ncompany credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that he has four delinquent consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.e), and that he has three delinquent student loans (SOR \u00b6 1.f-1.h). The security \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(d): deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

The most recent extension was on January \n20, 2021, and the COVID-19 emergency relief measures were extended on DoEd-owned \nfederal student loans through September 30, 2021. Appellant\u2019s assertion that he began \nmaking payments on his delinquent student loans in April 2021 is not supported by \ndocumentary evidence. Furthermore, his student loans had been delinquent for two years \nwhen the CARES Act forbearance began, raising serious doubt whether he will comply \nwith any payment agreements when the loans are no longer in forbearance. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated in June 2013 for \npoor attendance (SOR \u00b6 2.a), terminated in February 2014 following \u201carguments in the \nworkplace\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and terminated in July 2016 for \u201carguments in the workplace\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand poor attendance (SOR \u00b6 2.c). The SOR also cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 1.a, alleging \nApplicant\u2019s termination for misuse of a company credit card (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information . . . .\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nevidence in the FORM establish the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations . . . .  \nThe following mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17(c) is potentially relevant: \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d This mitigating condition is \nnot established. Some of Applicant\u2019s problems in the workplace were minor, but his \noverall conduct was not infrequent and did not occur under unique circumstances making \nit unlikely to recur. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) is not fully established. No other mitigating \nconditions are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \ndelinquencies and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate financial considerations concerns.

For good \ncause shown, Applicant was granted 20 days to supplement the record. (Tr. 45-46) \nDepartment Counsel was afforded five days to respond. Within the time permitted, \nApplicant supplemented the record with three submissions addressing her delinquent \naccounts. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted without objection as AEs A-C. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 14 delinquent medical, \nconsumer, and state tax debts exceeding $15,000. Allegedly, these debts remain \nunresolved and outstanding. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations. She claimed she has struggled with keeping jobs, as the contracts she \nwas assigned to were constantly being canceled or terminated. \nApplicant further claimed she is doing all she can to manage her personal \nfinances and has every intention to address her debts when circumstances permit. And, \nshe claimed she is continuing to look for another job to help her with her bills. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior professional planner of a defense contractor \nwho seeks eligibility to hold a public trust position.

(GEs 1-4)  \nHer listed delinquent debts are comprised of 12 delinquent consumer accounts \nexceeding $14,000, one delinquent medical account of $46, and one state tax debt of \n$6,230, covering tax years 2012-2013 and 2015-2016. (GEs 1-4) Applicant attributed \nher debt delinquencies to a combination of involuntary, fault-free layoffs due to \nemployer contract losses and emergency surgeries to repair an anterior collateral \nligament (ACL) for the second time in 2019. (AE A)   \nWhile Applicant is credited with entering into a recent tax payment agreement\nwith her state of residence, she has not to date documented any payments to the state\u2019s\ntaxing agency, and the outstanding balance remains unresolved. (GEs 1-4 and AE A;\nTr. 35-36) Since her hearing, she has received installment payment offers from three of\nher listed SOR creditors (covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. for $1,997, 1.e for $1,070, and 1.g for\n$886.00). Each of these installment offers propose monthly payment plans and seek\nwritten acceptance of the respective offers from Applicant. (AEs B-C)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s submissions include neither documented acceptances nor good-faith \nupfront payments accompanying her formal acceptances. (AEs A-C) Without verified \nacceptances of the creditor settlement offers and documented first payments in \ncompliance with the terms of the respective offers, resolution of these debts remain \nworks in progress. \nOf the debts covered by the SOR, only one of them can be considered resolved \nfor evidentiary purposes. Applicant could not identify SOR debt \u00b6 1.m (a medical debt \nfor $46), which was unfamiliar to her. (GEs 1-4) It is a small debt that could reasonably \nhave been resolved earlier or simply forgotten by Applicant. Either way, inferences are \nwarranted that the debt is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nBy her own acknowledgements, Applicant is not in a position at this time to make \nany serious inroads into addressing her delinquent accounts. She is doing all she can \njust to cover her necessities. (Tr. 49) She has no 401(k) retirement or savings accounts \nto draw from. (Tr. 38) \nWhile Applicant is current with her non-SOR debts, she has not sought financial \ncounseling to help her with her finances and needs a second job to address her \ndelinquent accounts. (Tr. 49) Finding a part-time dog-walking job promises to help \nApplicant with her accounts, but is not likely in the short-run to produce enough extra \nincome to enable her make any meaningful initiatives in addressing her accrued debts. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility to hold a public trust position is predicated upon the applicant meeting \nthe criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect privacy information. The guidelines include conditions that could raise a \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and \nall of the conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns, if any. These AG \nguidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not eligibility to hold a public \ntrust position should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable trust risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n                                         \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is  \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage.

With the exception of a $46 medical debt that she does \nnot recognize, she acknowledges all of the listed delinquent debts in the SOR as her \nown. \nJurisdictional issues \nHolding a public trust position involves the exercise of important fiducial \nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor in \nprotecting and guarding personally identifiable information (PII). DoD Manual 5200.02, \nwhich incorporated and canceled DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, covers both critical-\nsensitive and non-critical sensitive national security positions for DoD civilian personnel. \nSee 5200.02, \u00b6 4.1(3(c)3. \nDefinitions for critical-sensitive and non-critical sensitive positions provided in \n5200.02, \u00b6 4.1a(3)(c) contain descriptions similar to those used to define ADP I and II \npositions under DoD Regulation 5200.2-R. (32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154.13 and Part 154, App. J). \nADP positions are broken down a follows in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154.13 and Part 154, App. J: \nADP I (critical-sensitive positions covering the direction, design, and planning of \ncomputer systems) and ADP II (non-critical-sensitive positions covering the design, \noperation, and maintenance of computer systems). Considered together, the ADP I and \nII positions covered in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R refine and explain the same critical-\nsensitive and non-critical sensitive positions covered in DoD Manual 5200-02, \u00b6 4.1a \n(3)(c) and are reconcilable as included provisions in 5200.02. \nSo, while ADP trustworthiness positions are not expressly identified in DoD \nManual 5200.02, they are implicitly covered as non-critical sensitive positions that \nrequire \u2018access to automated systems that contain active duty, guard, or personally \nidentifiable information or information pertaining to Service members that is otherwise \nprotected from disclosure by DoD 5400.11-R . . .\u201d DoD 5200.02, \u00b64.1a(3)(c).

ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Mitigation \nrequirements are not met. Only the $46 medical debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.m is \nmitigated by virtue of the small amount of the debt, its age, and Applicant\u2019s inability to \nidentify the debt. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s eligibility to hold a public trust position \nrequires consideration of whether her accrued delinquent debts and her failure to \naddress them heretofore are otherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a \npublic trust position. While Applicant is entitled to credit for her contributions to the \ndefense industry, her employment contributions are not enough at this time to overcome \nher accumulated delinquent debts and her lack of a meaningful track record for dealing \nwith them. Based on what Applicant has been able to achieve to date with the financial \nresources available to her, she will need more time in addressing her debts before safe \npredictions can be made that she has her finances stabilized and under control. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that financial considerations\nconcerns covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b-1.o are not mitigated. Applicant is credited with\nmitigating the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since August of 2018. He has held a security clearance since about 2010, as Applicant is retired from the U.S. Navy. He is married, and has three children. (TR at page 14 line 11 to page 20 line 19, and GX 1 at pages 13 and 39.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. and 1.b. Applicant admits that he is indebted to the Department of Education in the amount of about $42,000. Applicant was making monthly payments of $410 towards this debt, until the Department of Education put a moratorium on accepting said payments due to the Civid-19 pandemic. (TR at page 20 line 20 to page 26 line 22, and Answer at pages 2~5.) Applicant is ready, willing and able to continue said payments. 1.c. Applicant denies that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax year 2018, and has submitted documentation demonstrating this filing.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on September 22, \n2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. and 1.e. He \ndenied SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since August of 2018. He has held a security \nclearance since about 2010, as Applicant is retired from the U.S. Navy. He is married, \nand has three children. (TR at page 14 line 11 to page 20 line 19, and GX 1 at pages 13 \nand 39.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant admits that he is indebted to the Department of Education \nin the amount of about $42,000. Applicant was making monthly payments of $410 \ntowards this debt, until the Department of Education put a moratorium on accepting said \npayments due to the Civid-19 pandemic. (TR at page 20 line 20 to page 26 line 22, and \nAnswer at pages 2~5.) Applicant is ready, willing and able to continue said payments. \n \n1.c. Applicant denies that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax \nyear 2018, and has submitted documentation demonstrating this filing. (TR at page 26 \nline 23 to page 28 line 1, and Answer at pages 6~8.) \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that he is indebted to the Federal Government, in the \namount of about $35,000 in past-due taxes for tax years 2015, 2017 and 2018. (TR at \npage 28 line 2 to page 31 line 25, and at page 35 line 16 to page 37 line 17.) Despite \nhaving a month, post-hearing, to submit something further in this regard, Applicant has \nfailed to do so. \n \n1.e.  Applicant admits that he is indebted to his state, in the amount of about \n$11,500 in past-due taxes for tax years 2017 and 2018. (TR at page 32 line 1 to page \n33 line 10.) Despite having a month, post-hearing, to submit something further in this \nregard, Applicant has failed to do so. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired \nApplicant allegedly failed to file his 2018 Federal income tax return, has \nsignificant Federal and state income tax debt, and significant outstanding student loans. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has filed his 2018 Federal income tax return; and is ready \nwilling and able to address his outstanding student loans, he has yet to address about \n$46,000 in back taxes. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. at 31; GE 4 at 32-33; AE G.) \nIn his 2020 SCA, he disclosed more recent uses of marijuana on the application in \naddition to the 2016-2017 uses.

He provided the following additional comments: \nDuring COVID-19 isolation, I Smoked some Marijuana to experiment during \na depression time 2 months into quarantine. It really did not help so I \nstopped.

As of January 2018, Applicant admitted using marijuana \napproximately three times between September 2016 and January 2017. He explained to \nthe investigator that he first used marijuana in 2016 by himself in his father\u2019s back yard \nwhile he was caring for his father who was ill. He told the investigator that he had no \nintention to use marijuana again because he did not enjoy the drug and he had too much \nto lose working as a contractor for the U.S. Government.

He diagnosed himself as feeling depressed. He bought the marijuana \nand a CBD chocolate edible from a marijuana dispensary that legally sold marijuana \nproducts under the law of his state. He ate the edible at home alone. He also discussed \nwith the investigator his prior use of marijuana starting in September 2016, when he was \ntaking care of his terminally ill father. He also mentioned his use at a New Year\u2019s Eve \nparty. (GE 3 at 1, 4-5.) \nApplicant testified that his past use of marijuana was during periods of stress when \nhe was feeling depressed by his life\u2019s circumstances, which included the loss of his long\u00ad\nterm marriage and the deaths of his mother in early 2016 and then his father in later 2016. \nHe also lost his brother, who was homeless and died in an accident, leaving Applicant \nwith only one family member, his sister.

This is a connection he already understood, \nhowever. He wrote in his June 2020 SCA that his use of marijuana two times in March \n2020 was due to feeling depressed. He no longer believes that he is suffering from any \npsychological issues. (Tr. at 18-21; GE 1 at 34-35; AE C.) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about the number of times he has used marijuana or another \nTHC product was inconsistent. He testified on direct examination that he only used \nmarijuana on three occasions. The first time was in March 2016, and the most recent time \nwas March 2020. On cross-examination, it became apparent that he had used marijuana \non more than three occasions. Applicant admitted that he used marijuana on two \noccasions in September 2016. Also, Department Counsel pointed out that in Applicant\u2019s \n2018 background interview, he admitted using marijuana on three occasions between \nSeptember 2016 and January 2017, the third time being at a New Year\u2019s Eve party with \nfriends. He then testified that he used marijuana once again in March 2020. He had written \nin his 2020 SCA that he last used marijuana twice in May 2020. At the hearing, he clarified \nthat the number of uses in 2020 was indeed twice. In 2020, he made a marijuana joint \nusing rolling paper he obtained from a neighbor. He lives in a condominium where it is \ncommon for his neighbors to smoke marijuana. He partially smoked the marijuana by \nhimself on a couple of occasions. He also testified that he consumed the chocolate CBD \nedible. (Tr. at 27-28, 41-52, 59-62, 64-66; GE 2 at 4-5; GE 3 at 4-5.) \nApplicant had some confusion about the date of the New Year\u2019s Eve party incident. \nHe attempted to change the date of his sole use of marijuana with friends from New Year\u2019s \nEve December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017. That testimony, however, was \ninconsistent with his disclosure in his April 2017 SCA, in which he dated the New Year\u2019s \nEve party as occurring about three months earlier, i.e., on December 31, 2016-January \n1, 2017. It could not have occurred one year later because that would have been after he \ndisclosed marijuana use over New Year\u2019s Eve 2016-2017 on his April 2017 SCA, a \ndocument he prepared only months later. In his attorney\u2019s Post-Hearing Arguments, the \nattorney clarified that upon reflection after the hearing, Applicant realized that he had used \nmarijuana at New Year\u2019s Eve parties in both years. (Tr. at 27-28, 41- 45; GE 3 at 4-5; \nHearing Exhibit II.) \nApplicant testified that he has no future intent to use marijuana. He also provided \na written statement confirming that intention and consenting to the automatic revocation \nof his clearance in the event of a violation of his statement. Applicant also testified that \nhe no longer associates with the individuals he had used marijuana with in the past. As \nnoted, he has twice represented in his clearance applications that he has no intention of \nusing marijuana again. Also, he advised the investigator in 2018 of this same intention, \nonly to smoke marijuana twice in May 2020 and to eat a CBD edible the same week.

He also provided evidence of his volunteer work, \nwhich was impressive. Two co-workers provided reference letters. Both were aware of \nthe SOR allegation. They praise Applicant\u2019s knowledge, dedication, skills, and work ethic. \nThey believe him to be reliable and trustworthy. (Tr. at 24-65; AE E; AE F.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause\nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or\npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.\nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence established the following conditions under AG \u00b6 25 \nthat could be disqualifying: \n(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(f) : any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position; and \n(g) : expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nAs for AG \u00b6 25(g), the record evidence does not clearly and convincingly establish \nthat Applicant is committed to discontinuing his use of marijuana and/or THC/CBD \nproducts. His last use in May 2020 precedes his written statement of intent by less than \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \none year. Moreover, he did not honor his past statements that he had no future intent to \nuse illegal drugs. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Two of these mitigating conditions have possible \napplicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) : the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) : the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use in 2020, after having his \nsecurity clearance renewed in 2018, is too recent and casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness and judgment. The information provided by his attorney that \nApplicant had used marijuana at two New Year\u2019s Eve parties is not material in light of \nApplicant\u2019s more recent use of marijuana in 2020. The record evidence establishes that \nApplicant used marijuana on and off since 2016 to deal with stress and difficult times in \nhis life. It cannot be concluded that his use of marijuana was infrequent and happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Future stressful circumstances or \nperiods of depression are quite possible, and Applicant may try to self-medicate with \nillegal drugs in the future. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement. He has only abstained from using marijuana, however, since May 2020, a \nlittle over one year ago. He claims he has disassociated himself from drug-using \nassociates, yet in May 2020 he was able to obtain a rolling paper from a neighbor who is \na frequent marijuana user to make a joint for himself. He also acknowledged that he lives \nin a condominium building where many of his neighbors use marijuana, which is legal to \npurchase under the laws of the state in which he resides. Applicant has presented a \nformal statement denying any future intent to use marijuana. He has repeatedly advised \nthe U.S. Government, however, that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future \nonly to continue to use it. He has shown in the past no serious commitment to honor those \nstatements of intent, nor has he shown a sufficient track record of abstinence since May \n2020. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the \nwhole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the following adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional comments are warranted. I \nhave considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service in the Navy and the service he \nhas provided our military for many years as a contractor. But I have also considered his \nage and maturity. He is not a young man who does not know better. He appreciates the \nFederal Government\u2019s law regarding marijuana as an illegal drug and still used it knowing \nhe was violating the law. He also knew that he was putting his job and career at risk by \nusing marijuana while holding a security clearance. His evidence in mitigation falls short \nof mitigating the security concerns raised by his actions over the past five years. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant used marijuana, about once or twice a month, from about January \nof 2007 until December of 2009, while granted access to classified information. (TR at \npage 13 line 20 to page 14 line 25.) \n2.b. Applicant used cocaine, on two occasions, during the period from about \nJanuary of 2007 until December of 2009, while granted access to classified information. \n(TR at page 15 lines 1~14.) \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n1.b. Applicant falsified his November 2011 SF-86, in answer to Section 23, by \nfailing to disclose his drug involvement, noted above. (TR at page 22 line 24 to page 24\nline 12, and GX 1 at page 22.) I find this falsification to be willful. \n \n1.a. Applicant falsified his May 2020 SF-86, in answer to Section 23, by failing to \ndisclose his cocaine involvement, noted above. (TR at page 22 line 24 to page 23 line\n19, at page 24 line 17 to page 25 line 14, and GX 1 at page 22.) I find this falsification to\nbe willful. \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used marijuana and cocaine. He had a security clearance for his job at \nthat time. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement was more than a decade ago. He has submitted a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. \n(AppX B.) The Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse guideline is found for \nApplicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsified two security clearance applications: in 2011 and again in 2020. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \nApplicant\u2019s willful falsifications cover a decade. He made no prompt, good-faith \neffort to correct this personal misconduct on either occasion. Personal Conduct is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the defense industry and is \nrespected in the workplace. He performs well at his job. (AppXs C and D.) However, \noverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He stated that he \nknew he should have claimed the money on his taxes, but chose not to report it because \neach job is random and he does not keep track of the amount of money he earns.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and (f). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant asserted that his tax issues arose from income earned while working as \nan independent contractor on \u201cside jobs.\u201d He failed to adequately and plausibly explain \nwhy he ignored his federal and state tax obligations, besides stating that he did not \nunderstand his state\u2019s tax laws, and that he did not keep track of his income. I note that \nApplicant has been employed by a defense contractor since 2018 and received notice of \nthis issue when he completed his SCA in 2020, but he has yet to rectify his tax \ndelinquencies. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held: \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nApplicant has not provided persuasive evidence showing resolution of his tax \ndelinquencies. In addition, I have no evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s current financial \nstatus or receipt of any financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s many years of failing to file and \npay federal and state taxes for his independent income indicates an inability or \nunwillingness to comply with tax laws. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems are longstanding and remain a current concern. I am not \npersuaded that Applicant has a handle on his federal tax obligations, or that he has shown \nsufficient financial responsibility. I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to voluntarily abide by government rules \nand regulations. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24:   \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant purchased, possessed, and used marijuana less than 10 times between \n2005 and 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions, and find the following conditions as \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n6 \n  (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n\n \n \n \n  (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has a history of minor marijuana use, typically at social gatherings. He \nused marijuana less than 10 times over several years, the last being in 2019 at a camping \ntrip. It was legal under state law. Applicant noted in his Answer that he would abstain from \nfurther drug use and would sign a statement of abstinence and submit to drug tests if \nasked. \nApplicant has established a record of compliance with federal law with respect to \nmarijuana use since 2019. I am convinced by Applicant\u2019s assertions that he fully \nunderstands the federal law with respect to marijuana use, and has made a dedicated \nchange of lifestyle to abstain from future use of marijuana. Mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and (b) generally apply. \nApplicant has mitigated his past use of marijuana and it no longer impugns his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person analysis. I conclude the \nGuideline H concern in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, based on his failure to file and pay \nincome taxes as required, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue eligibility for access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Subparagraph 2.a: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old. He has never married and he has no children. (Item 4 at 26) He graduated from high school in 2008, and earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011.

(Item 4 at 17-21) In May 2015, after finishing his classes, he moved to a new state for a job in mechanical engineering. He has worked for that employer ever since.

Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR on April 27, 2021, he admitted both \nallegations in the SOR without further comment, and requested a decision based on the \nadministrative (written) record, without a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn May 30, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 5. Items 1 \nand 3 are the pleadings in the case (the SOR and the Answer), and Item 2 is the SOR \ntransmittal letter. Items 4 and 5 were offered as substantive evidence. \nThe FORM was mailed to Applicant on June 1, 2021. He was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, and was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to do so. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on June 7, 2021. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, nor did he \nnote any objections to the Government\u2019s proposed evidence. FORM Items 4 and 5 are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on September \n7, 2021. \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b without further comment. His admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He has never married and he has no children. (Item 4 \nat 26) He graduated from high school in 2008, and earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2011. He continued his academic studies for several years after that (2011-2015), but \ndid not earn an advanced degree. (Item 4 at 14-15; Item 5 at 11) \nWhile continuing his education, Applicant worked various jobs, including as a \nresearch assistant (2012-2013), a self-employed engineer (2013-2014), and a graduate \nteaching assistant (2014-2015) among other jobs. (Item 4 at 17-21) In May 2015, after \nfinishing his classes, he moved to a new state for a job in mechanical engineering. He \nhas worked for that employer ever since. (Item 4 at 16) \nThe allegations in the SOR concern Applicant\u2019s one-time use of Adderall, without \na prescription, in March 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and his one-time use of \u201cMolly,\u201d while holding \na security clearance, in August 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.b).8 \u201cMolly\u201d is another word for Ecstasy, \nor MDNA. (See https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/mdma-ecstasymolly) \nApplicant had a background interview in April 2018, in which he discussed his \none-time use of Adderall, in March 2013. The SCA that preceded that interview is not in \nthe record, on which he appears to have disclosed his Adderall use. He explained that \nhe was given the Adderall by a friend before they went out to a bar. The Adderall was \nnot prescribed to the friend, and it was not prescribed to Applicant.

(Item 4 at 43) \nOn or about September 23, 2020, Applicant had his background interview for his \nmost recent SCA. (Item 5 at 10) He confirmed his 2013 Adderall use, as previously \ndisclosed. Applicant was then asked if he had ever illegally used or otherwise been \ninvolved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. He \nresponded in the affirmative. He disclosed that, in late August 2020, after submitting his \nSCA earlier that month, he had been at a party and someone had offered him some \nwhite powder, a drug called \u201cMolly.\u201d He tasted the powder by wetting his finger, dipping \nit into the powder, and then licking his finger. He did this three times. (Item 5 at 15) \nApplicant said he tried the drug because he was curious. He knew that he had a \nsecurity clearance at the time, and he knew the drug was illegal. He acknowledged in \nthe interview that he made an unwise decision. He said he was offered another chance \nto use the powder at the party but declined. (Item 5 at 15) Applicant indicated during the \ninterview that he will not use any drugs in the future because it is illegal and not worth \nrisking his job. He said he regretted his decision to use the powder and would not do it \nagain. (Item 5 at 15) \nApplicant authenticated both of his interview summaries in January 2021, without \nsubstantive alterations. (Item 5) He also disclosed both the Adderall and Molly usage \nagain, in the portion of the interrogatory regarding recent drug involvement. (Item 5 at \n20) \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations without further comment. He did not \nrespond to the Government\u2019s FORM or otherwise offer any mitigating evidence beyond \nwhat he had previously stated. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s use of Adderall without a prescription establishes AG \u00b6 25(a) since \nmisuse of prescription drugs is considered an illegal use of a controlled substance, as \naddressed in AG \u00b6 24. Applicant\u2019s use of \u201cMolly\u201d, while holding a security clearance, \nestablishes both AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(f). AG \u00b6 25(c) is established because he \npossessed both substances when using them. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nand \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s illegal substance use was not \nfrequent, as it occurred on two occasions several years apart. However, the second \ninstance was recent, as it occurred in August 2020, just over a year ago. Inexplicably, it \nalso occurred not only while Applicant possessed a security clearance, but only days \nafter he submitted his SCA (on which he disclosed his 2013 Adderall use, and noted \nthat he knew it was illegal), and while he was undergoing an additional review of his \nclearance eligibility. Further, Applicant offered no mitigating evidence in either his SOR \nresponse or in answer to the Government\u2019s FORM. While Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is \nisolated and not frequent, the recency of his most recent use, and its circumstances, \npreclude full application of either AG \u00b6 26(a) or AG \u00b6 26(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns about his drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, which includes recent illegal drug use while holding a security \nclearance. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 48 years old. He graduated from a military service academy and served for 20 years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 2014. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 1999. He is divorced with two children who are 17 and 14 years old. He stated in his answer that while on active duty he held a security clearance without incident. (Item 4) Applicant admitted that he used marijuana every other week from approximately 2016 to July 2020. He admitted that from June 2016 to December 2017, incident to his employment with Company A, he engaged in the cultivation and sale of marijuana. He admitted that from October 2018 until January 2020, incident to his employment with Company B, he engaged in the commercial manufacture and sale of marijuana and marijuana products. He admitted that since June 2020, incident to his employment with Company C, he has engaged in the commercial manufacture and sale of marijuana and marijuana products. (Items 4, 5, 6) Applicant primarily provided argument in his answer to the SOR and response to the FORM stating that because cannabis is legal in the state and Canada where he used it and conducted business, his conduct was not illegal. He provided a narrative citing policy memos by the federal government for not pursuing federal marijuana laws in states that had legalized it. ",

Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on August 17, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2021. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 4 through 6. (Item 1 is the SOR; Item 2 is a transmittal \nletter, and Item 3 is a receipt) Applicant provided a response to the FORM, and it is \nmarked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A). Applicant objected to the Department Counsel\u2019s \ncomments in the FORM on the frequency of his use of marijuana, which he stated was \nincorrect. Department Counsel\u2019s comments in her brief that are part of the FORM are not \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s objection is overruled. There were no other objections to the \nevidence offered, and Items 4 through 6, and AE A are admitted into evidence. The case \nwas assigned to me on October 26, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He graduated from a military service academy and \nserved for 20 years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 2014. He earned a master\u2019s degree \nin 1999. He is divorced with two children who are 17 and 14 years old. He stated in his \nanswer that while on active duty he held a security clearance without incident. (Item 4) \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana every other week from approximately \n2016 to July 2020. He admitted that from June 2016 to December 2017, incident to his \nemployment with Company A, he engaged in the cultivation and sale of marijuana. He \nadmitted that from October 2018 until January 2020, incident to his employment with \nCompany B, he engaged in the commercial manufacture and sale of marijuana and \nmarijuana products. He admitted that since June 2020, incident to his employment with \nCompany C, he has engaged in the commercial manufacture and sale of marijuana and \nmarijuana products. (Items 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant primarily provided argument in his answer to the SOR and response to \nthe FORM stating that because cannabis is legal in the state and Canada where he used \nit and conducted business, his conduct was not illegal. He provided a narrative citing \npolicy memos by the federal government for not pursuing federal marijuana laws in states \nthat had legalized it. He provided further argument in his response to the FORM to show \nthat the federal government has chosen not to shut down the cannabis industry in states \nwhere it is legal under state law. He also noted that medical marijuana is legal in 19 states. \n(Item 4; AE A) \n \n \n \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in July 2020. During\nApplicant\u2019s September 2020 background interview with a government investigator he \nstated that he had not used marijuana since July 2020. (Items 5, 6) In his answer to the\nSOR, he stated:  \nI admit to the legal consumption of legal cannabis in small quantities \napproximately every other week on average for the stated time period in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S jurisdictions with legal adult-size cannabis programs and in Canada \nwith a legal adult-use federal program (after Canada legalized federally). \n(Item 4) \nApplicant has not made any statement in his answer, response to interrogatories, \nor response to the FORM that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Items \n4, 5, 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana from 2016 to July 2020. He admitted to \nbeing involved in the manufacture, distribution, and cultivation of marijuana while \nemployed with different companies from June 2016 to December 2017, October 2018 to \nJanuary 2020 and since June 2020. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nUnder the Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801), marijuana is a \nSchedule I drug and illegal to manufacture, possess, or distribute. Regardless of some \nstate laws decriminalizing the use of marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law, which \nis controlling over state law. Despite Applicant\u2019s arguments for why the law should be \nchanged, it is well settled that marijuana use, possession, manufacture, cultivation, and \ndistribution are illegal under federal law. In addition, DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board (ISCR Case \nNo. 14-03734 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016)) has held that state laws permitting the use of \nmarijuana do not preempt the Industrial Security Program, and DOD is not bound by the \nstatus of applicants\u2019 conduct under state law when adjudicating eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nApplicant provided a well-researched analysis of the different federal policy \npositions regarding state legalization of marijuana use and the manufacture and \ndistribution of it. It is clear through his detailed research, analysis, and passionate \nargument that he understands that despite his hope, marijuana remains illegal under \nfederal law. \nI find his marijuana use, every other week over a four-year period ending in July \n2020, when he completed his security clearance application, as recent and frequent. \nApplicant made a passionate argument and carefully noted that all of his marijuana use, \npossession, manufacture, and cultivation was legal under state law. I did not have an \nopportunity to make a credibility determination. However, Applicant did not provide a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse in \nthe future. I am not convinced future illegal drug use is unlikely. He continued as of June \n2020 to work in the business of selling marijuana. He failed to provide evidence that he \nno longer associates with others who use illegal drugs or has changed his environment. \nThe above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 48 years old and retired from the military. He has not met his burden \nof persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 25-year-old service desk technician employed by federal contractors since June 2017. He has never married and has no children. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from July 2015 to February 2017 and received an honorable discharge. He was unemployed from February to June 2017. He received a security clearance in February 2015 while in the Air Force, and he received a top secret clearance in November 2018. The SOR alleges a car loan charged off for $26,583 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a credit-card account charged off for $8,633 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and a credit-card account referred for collection of $4,112 (SOR \u00b6 1.c).

He received a security clearance in \nFebruary 2015 while in the Air Force, and he received a top secret clearance in November \n2018. \nThe SOR alleges a car loan charged off for $26,583 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a credit-card \naccount charged off for $8,633 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and a credit-card account referred for \ncollection of $4,112 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The debts are reflected in credit reports from September \n2020 and January 2021 (FORM Items 4 and 5.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he \nattributed his delinquent debts to \u201cthe hubris of youth and believing that [he] could take \nhis time with this issue.\u201d He promised to provide a detailed plan for resolving his \ndelinquent debts. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he submitted a detailed budget reflecting \nmonthly income of $3,800 and expenses of $3,365, and a plan to pay off all his delinquent \ndebts by March 2023. His budget and payment plan appear to have been generated with \nan on-line budgeting tool. He promised to carry out his plan, but he provided no \ndocumentary evidence of payments or payment agreements with his creditors. He \nsubmitted documentary evidence that he has remained current on another credit-card \naccount since November 2020. He asserted that he has consistently paid his rent on time \nand promised to submit documentary evidence to support his assertion, but no such \nevidence was included in his FORM response. He did not submit any evidence of financial \ncounseling. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has three \nunresolved delinquent debts totaling approximately $39,000. His unemployment in 2017, \nwithout evidence of actions to pay his debts once he became employed, does not \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). His debts are numerous and recent. He submitted \nno evidence that they were incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely and \nno evidence that they were the result of conditions largely beyond his control. He \nsubmitted documents reflecting his plan for resolving his delinquent debts, but the \ndocuments do not establish the type of financial counseling contemplated by this \nmitigating condition. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of payments or payment \nagreements for any of the debts. It is reasonable for an administrative judge to expect an \napplicant to present documentary evidence showing resolution of specific debts. ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). Applicant has promised to carry out his \npayment plan and resolve his delinquent debts by March 2023. However, a promise to \nresolve delinquent debts in the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts \nin a timely manner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant did not take any actions to resolve his delinquent debts until he received \nthe SOR. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts \nmay be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. \nISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and the fact that he has held a security clearance since February 2015.

After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

As this debt also appears as past-due \non the Government\u2019s most recent, August 2021, credit report (GX 6 at page 2), this \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n1.f.  Applicant has submitted documentation showing he settled and paid the \nalleged $799 past-due debt to Creditor F. (TR at page 21 line 7 to page 22 line 12.)

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had a plethora of past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAlthough Applicant has addressed much of his past-due indebtedness, his \nfinancial problems are ongoing. Applicant still has nearly $12,000 of past-due \nindebtedness. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) has not been established. Financial Considerations is found \nagainst Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i~1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.n~1.x: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must \nbe considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. AG \u00b6 18. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

Sept. 24, 2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information.

Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties associated with his major student loan and \ncredit card delinquencies raise initial concerns over his ability to manage his finances in \na responsible and reliable way. \nExtenuating circumstances played a considerable evidentiary role in Applicant\u2019s \naccumulation of his two delinquent accounts. Stressed by his wife\u2019s accident and his \nown surgical procedures in the 2014 time-frame, he and his wife struggled to maintain \ntheir finances in stable order over the course of the ensuing seven years. MC \u00b6 20(b), \n\u201dthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nWith the two payoffs of the listed SOR debts credited to him, Applicant may take \nadvantage of two other mitigating conditions: MCs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe individual has received \ncounseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d are applicable \nas well.

With his cited extenuating \ncircumstances serving as the principal underlying sources of his financial difficulties, \nApplicant\u2019s recent repayment efforts provide sufficient evidence of responsible \nmanagement of his finances to enable him to mitigate financial consideration concerns. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had delinquent income tax filings, delinquent Federal income taxes, \nand other past-due debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate financial security concerns. I \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has filed all his delinquent income tax returns, is paying down his \nFederal income tax debt, and has addressed the other alleged past-due debts. He has \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nbeen established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrespected in the workplace. (TR at page 38 line 1 to page 40 line 2.) He performs well at \nhis job.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.f. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

On \nMarch 8, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H.

She earned her high \nschool diploma in May 2011, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. She has been taking \ncourses part time at a university school of business since March 2018.

She characterized her use during that period as \u201cexperimental\u201d \nand estimated that she used marijuana no more than 10 times. She resumed using \nmarijuana during a one-month period between March and April 2017. She attributed her \nuse during this second period to poor decisions she made while partying in her early \ntwenties and to her immaturity. She estimated that she used marijuana only a \u201chandful of \ntimes\u201d when it was offered to her. She regrets using marijuana and has no intent to use it \nagain. (Item 2; Item 3 at 39-40) \nApplicant used cocaine one time in March 2017 at a party, after a person with \nwhom she no longer associates offered it to her. She characterized her one-time use of \ncocaine as a lapse in judgment. She regrets using cocaine and has no intent to use it \nagain. She understands that, in addition to jeopardizing her career, cocaine is a \ndangerous drug. (Item 2; Item 3 at 40-41) \nApplicant acknowledged that she possessed a security clearance when she used \nmarijuana and cocaine in 2017, but denied that she had been granted access to classified \ninformation because she did not have a \u201cneed to know\u201d for any classified programs at the \ntime. She asserted that her 2017 drug use was infrequent and occurred during a short \ntime span when she anticipated leaving her job to seek employment outside of the \ndefense industry and would no longer need a security clearance. Once she realized that \nshe enjoyed her job and intended to remain in her position, she recognized the need to \navoid using illegal drugs. She acknowledged that illegal drug use \u201copens [her] up to the \nrisk of being deemed untrustworthy and therefore not being able to renew [her] \nclearance.\u201d (Item 2; Item 3 at 40-41) \nApplicant self-reported the history of her illegal drug use on her 2019 SCA and in \nher SOR answer. She acknowledged that illegal drug use is incompatible with the \nmaintenance of a security clearance. In her subscribed and sworn SOR answer, Applicant \nprofessed a sincere commitment to remain abstinent from marijuana and other illegal \ndrugs. She no longer associates with anyone who does any type of illegal drugs. The \nrecord did not indicate whether she self-reported her 2017 drug use to her supervisor or \nfacility security officer prior to the disclosure she made on her 2019 SCA.

She is \ncommitted to her work and will not put her career in jeopardy again. She stated: \u201cI take \npride in the work I do for my company and for the [U.S.] Government and going forward \nfrom 2017, have only acted in ways that hold the trust put in me as sacred.\u201d (Item 2) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use establishes the following disqualifying conditions (DC) \nunder this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nAlthough Applicant denied that she had been granted access to classified \ninformation on the basis that she did not have a \u201cneed to know\u201d for any classified \nprograms at the time, I find that there is sufficient record evidence to apply AG \u00b6 25(f). \nAG \u00b6 25(f) applies because she had access to classified information upon being granted \na security clearance in 2015, regardless of whether she actually worked on classified \nprograms. Moreover, as a cleared defense contractor, she holds a sensitive position \nwhere she could potentially be exposed to classified or sensitive information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAny illegal drug use is troubling in the context of evaluating security worthiness. If \nApplicant had ceased all marijuana use after college, she could have demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation and mitigated any drug involvement concerns. However, she not \nonly resumed using marijuana after college and during her employment as a defense \ncontractor, but also while she held a security clearance, which is particularly egregious. \nThis history underscores both a pattern of questionable judgment; and also calls into \nquestion her ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nDuring a one-month period in 2017, Applicant used marijuana on more than one \noccasion and used cocaine for the first time. Each time that she chose to use an illegal \ndrug during this period, she did so while in possession of a security clearance. The \njustifications she proffered for what she considered a temporary lapse in judgment over \na short time span do less to support mitigation than to underscore the fact that Applicant \nknew that her 2017 drug use was incompatible with maintaining her security clearance. I \nrecognize the passage of four years since her last drug use and credit Applicant\u2019s sincere \ncommitment to remain abstinent from marijuana and other illegal drugs. However, the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding her history of illegal drug use continue to raise \ndoubts about her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, \nand considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her \nillegal drug use. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: Against Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 4.) \nApplicant had not previousy submitted any documents showing that he was addressing \nthose debts. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s credit report. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy period of unemployment caused by his honorable discharge \nfrom the service was unusual and largely beyond his control. Although the magnitude of \nthe SOR debts was significant, Applicant successfully resolved them to the satisfaction \nof his creditors. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 (a), (b), and (d) apply. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have also considered the whole-person concept. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions or doubts as to his eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-c.:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 35-year-old principal proposal analyst of a defense contractor. He has been serving in that position with his current sponsor since May 2019. He previously served with other employers as a senior associate from 2016 until 2018; and as a senior auditor from 2008 until 2016. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008, and has earned additional college credits, but no degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, but, as stated by Applicant, if he did, it was a confidential clearance. He has never been married, but he has been cohabiting since 2019. He has no children. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and Personal Conduct Applicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substances of choice were marijuana and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as Ecstasy, \u2013 both Schedule I Controlled Substances. Applicant\u2019s self-reported history of drug involvement, as well as his declared future intentions, are inconsistent, and it appears that he was not fully candid. On Se",

On May 21, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance for Applicant.

A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 7, 2021, and he was afforded \nan opportunity, within a period of 30 days, to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 15, 2021. His response was due on August 16, \n2021. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of August 20, 2021, no \nresponse had been received. The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2021. The \nrecord closed on August 16, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, the factual \nallegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 35-year-old principal proposal analyst of a defense contractor. He \nhas been serving in that position with his current sponsor since May 2019. He previously \nserved with other employers as a senior associate from 2016 until 2018; and as a senior \nauditor from 2008 until 2016. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008, and has earned \nadditional college credits, but no degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. It is \nunclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, but, as stated by Applicant, if he did, \nit was a confidential clearance. He has never been married, but he has been cohabiting \nsince 2019. He has no children. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and Personal Conduct \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substances of choice were \nmarijuana and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as Ecstasy, \u2013 \nboth Schedule I Controlled Substances. Applicant\u2019s self-reported history of drug \ninvolvement, as well as his declared future intentions, are inconsistent, and it appears \nthat he was not fully candid. \nOn September 11, 2009, he was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, he claimed that he had initially \nexperimented with marijuana in August 2007, when a friend (K) brought some marijuana \nto his residence. The marijuana made him feel light headed and happy, and he liked the \nexperience. He admitted that he continued using marijuana on about ten occasions from \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 2008 until April 2008, also at his residence and at K\u2019s house, when the same \nfriend brought the marijuana to his apartment. He also acknowledged that on at least two \nof those occasions, he paid his friend for the marijuana. He said that he last smoked \nmarijuana in April 2008, and that he quit using the substance because he is graduating \nfrom college and looking for a job, and no longer needed to experiment with marijuana \nany longer. He specifically stated that he will not use any illegal drugs because it would \njeopardize his job, his future, and his health. (Item 4, at 4) Between his April 2008 \nmarijuana use and September 18, 2009, when he was again interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator, Applicant stated that he had not socialized or associated with anyone who \nuses or to his knowledge has access to marijuana or any other illegal drug. He intended \nto dis-associate himself from anyone who he subsequently learns falls into those \ncategories. (Item 4, at 5) \nIn his September 2019 SF 86, Applicant added to the narrative with respect to his \ndrug involvement. He acknowledged that he had used marijuana from December 2004 \nuntil December 2018. He admitted that he used it \u201cdozens of times over the past decade,\u201d \ndaily at times and less frequently at other times. Once again, he repeated his earlier \ndeclared intention not to use marijuana in the future so as not to jeopardize his \nemployment or security clearance. (Item 2, at 58-59) \nApplicant underwent another OPM interview on October 16, 2019. During that \ninterview he noted that a friend since childhood (T) had used marijuana with him, and \nsometimes Applicant smoked marijuana alone at home. He obtained the marijuana from \ndispensaries. The marijuana had a relaxing effect on him. As of the date of the interview, \nApplicant and T had contact every few weeks via text message or face-to-face interaction. \n(Item 3, at 9-10) \nApplicant\u2019s SF 86 also revealed that, from April 2014 and continuing until July\n2019, he used Ecstasy. He used it recreationally over that period, estimated to be about \na dozen times. He stated that he had no intent to use Ecstasy in the future. (Item 2, at 59-\n60)  \n \nDuring his October 2019 OPM interview, Applicant elaborated about his Ecstasy \nuse by noting that he generally obtained the drug from another friend (J), and that he \nused it at music festivals. Ecstasy has a euphoric effect on him. As of the date of the \ninterview, Applicant and J had contact every two-to-three weeks, and the past few times \nthey went to dinner together. He identified his current cohabitant as an individual with \ninformation regarding his Ecstasy use. (Item 3, at 10) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \n \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . . purchase. . .; \nand \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant is admittedly a recreational substance abuser whose substances of \nchoice was marijuana and Ecstasy \u2013 both Schedule I Controlled Substances. He used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from December 2004 until at least December 2018. He \nalso used Ecstasy with varying frequency from April 2014 until at least July 2019. He \nperiodically purchased marijuana. In September 2009, he specifically stated that he will \nnot use any illegal drugs because it would jeopardize his job, his future, and his health. \nDespite that expressed intention, he continued to use illegal drugs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(g) \nhave been established, but for reasons set forth below, AG \u00b6 25 (c) was not established. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s purchases of marijuana were known to the DCSA CAF before the SOR \nwas issued, his purchases were not alleged in the SOR. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to \nconsider such unalleged issues in the whole-person analysis. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nNeither condition applies. Applicant has purchased and used marijuana frequently \nfor over two decades; has never received treatment and counseling as a result of his \nillegal use of marijuana; has been disciplined by the military for a positive urinalysis; has \nbeen arrested, charged, and convicted of use, possession, or delivery of drug \nparaphernalia; and he has no intention of ceasing his marijuana use. He was open about \nhis past, continuing, and future relationship with marijuana, and for that candor, he is \ngiven credit. \nHe has objected to any compliance with marijuana laws and regulations, simply \nbecause he disagrees with them. In a free society, he is free to object to those laws and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nregulations, but in ignoring them, he runs the risk of additional punishment should he \nviolate the law. Moreover, his position is inconsistent with eligibility for a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s refusal to disavow future marijuana use continues to cast \nsubstantial doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. He is a 37-year-old project \nengineer of a defense contractor. He has been serving in that position with his current \nsponsor since May 2013. He previously served in an identical capacity with a \nsubcontractor from 2011 until 2013. He is a 2001 high school graduate, and received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 2001, and remained \non active duty until August 2005 when he was honorably discharged. He has been candid \nin acknowledging his past, current, and future association with marijuana. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is admittedly a recreational substance abuser, and he has had a close affiliation \nwith marijuana for over two decades. He has purchased, used, and shared marijuana \nfrequently; has never received treatment and counseling as a result of his illegal use of \nmarijuana; has been disciplined by the military for a positive urinalysis; and has been \narrested, charged, and convicted of use, possession, or delivery of drug paraphernalia. \nHe has no intention of ceasing his marijuana use. He has shown a proven unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations in using marijuana, and he intends to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse and his personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 28, 2020, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of interrogatories \ncontaining an Enhanced Subject Interview, dated April 23, 2020. He responded to the \ninterrogatories on March 16, 2021. On April 16, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec.

The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn statement, dated April 22, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on June 1, 2021, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on July 2, 2021. His \nresponse was due on August 1, 2021. He timely responded and submitted two \ndocuments, to which there were no objections, and both documents were marked and \nadmitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. The case was assigned to me \non August 27, 2021. The record closed on August 1, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, the \nfactual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 23-year-old employee of a defense contractor that is a management \nand information technology consulting firm. It is unclear when he joined his employer, \nalthough it had to occur after he was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) in April 2020, or what position he holds with his \nemployer, as the record is silent as to those details. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2019, and was recognized as a college all-region scholar-athlete. There is an unverified \nindication that he may have received a master\u2019s degree. He has never served with the \nU.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He has never been married. He has \nno children. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose primary substance of choice \nwas marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. He started casually smoking \nmarijuana several times per week in November 2016, and continued such use through at \nleast January 2020 when he completed his SF 86. At that time, he candidly indicated an \nintention to continue using marijuana in anticipation of such use becoming legalized. (Item \n3, at 28-29) During his April 2020 OPM interview, he acknowledged that he continued his \nuse of marijuana until at least April 2020. (Item 4, at 9) However, in his March 2021 \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nAnswers to the interrogatories, and in his April 2021 Answer to the SOR, he admitted that \nhe was still using marijuana until at least March 2021. (Item 2, at 1; Item 4, at 5) He used \nmarijuana because he enjoyed the feeling of being high. He continues to associate with \nfriends who use marijuana illegally. He has purchased marijuana with varying frequency \nuntil at least March 2021. (Item 4, at 10; Item 2, at 1) \nApplicant\u2019s secondary substance of choice was cocaine \u2013 a Schedule II Controlled \nSubstance. He started using cocaine in casual party-settings with friends in March 2017, \nand continued such use on about ten occasions through at least January 2020 when he \ncompleted his SF 86. At that time, he stated that he intended to eliminate all drug use \nafter college. (Item 3, at 29) However, in his March 2021 Answers to the interrogatories, \nand in his April 2021 Answer to the SOR, he admitted that he was still using cocaine until \nat least March 2021 \u2013 approximately two years after he graduated from college. He also \nmodified his previously-stated future intentions regarding cocaine by stating that he \u201cwill \nstop using the drug if need be.\u201d (Item 2, at 1; Item 4, at 5) He used cocaine, initially \nbecause of peer pressure, and eventually because it caused him to have an energizing \nfeeling. (Item 4, at 9) He continues to associate with friends who use cocaine illegally. \nOn two occasions he also experimented with hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms \n\u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. He used the substance in December 2017 and \nMarch 2018 due to peer pressure from two friends at a friend\u2019s home in \u201ca controlled \nenvironment\u201d \u2013 not otherwise described. (Item 3, at 29; Item 4, at 10)  During his April \n2020 OPM interview, he stated that he had no future intent to use the substance because \nhe had \u201cno need\u201d to do so. (Item 4, at 10) He continues to associate with friends who use \npsilocybin mushrooms illegally. \nApplicant chose not to provide information of individuals who were directly involved \nin his drug use, whether it applied to the marijuana, cocaine, or the psilocybin mushrooms. \n(Item 4, at 9-10) There is no evidence that Applicant ever tested positive for any illegal \nsubstance, or that he has ever received treatment and counseling as a result of his illegal \nuse of controlled substances. It was not until he received the FORM that he altered his \ndirection regarding drug involvement and substance misuse. He contends that since he \nis now removed from the college environment, he intends to abstain from all illegal drug \nbehavior, drug involvement, and substance misuse. (AE B) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . . purchase. . . ; \nand \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. He frequently \npurchased and used marijuana, and periodically used cocaine, both controlled \nsubstances, for several years, until as recently as March 2021 \u2013 approximately five \nmonths ago. On several occasions in the past, he stated that he intended to continue \nusing marijuana in the future, and stated that he would no longer use cocaine. He \ncontinued to use both substances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) minimally applies. After several years of illegally using two controlled \nsubstances, Applicant finally reportedly stopped doing so about five months ago, hardly \nqualifying as \u201cso long ago.\u201d His use of marijuana was a frequent occurrence over the \nyears, and his periodic use of cocaine still was not infrequent. His experimentation with \npsilocybin mushrooms is considered unalleged conduct. \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

He was open about his use \nof marijuana and cocaine when he completed his SF 86, and for that candor, he is given \ncredit. He acknowledged his drug involvement and substance misuse, but his evidence \nof actions purportedly taken to overcome his problems has been far from convincing or \nsubstantial. \nHe has, as of only one month ago, stated an intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement in such \nactivities is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. He contends he has \navoided the environment where drugs were used, but he acknowledged that he continues \nto associate with friends who used drugs with him. Applicant established a pattern of \nclearly intending to use marijuana in the future, and continued doing so. Only now has he \nclaimed to have altered his future path. He also established a pattern of intending to avoid \ncocaine, only to have ignored his stated intent by continuing to use cocaine. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, he repeatedly used marijuana and cocaine for several years, continuing \nto do so as recently as March 2021 \u2013 approximately five months ago. Continued \nabstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history, the relatively \nbrief five-month period of such abstinence, and his changing intentions regarding \nmarijuana and cocaine in the future, are considered insufficient to conclude that the \nabstinence will continue. Applicant\u2019s claimed new compliance with laws, rules, and \nregulations, is in stark contrast to his cavalier attitude towards those same laws, rules, \nand regulations. His use of marijuana and cocaine, despite knowing that such use was \nprohibited by both the Government and his sponsors, and his refusal, until recently, to \ndisavow future marijuana use, as well as his previously abandoned intent to cease using \ncocaine, continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nWith regard to the SOR allegation that Applicant continued to use marijuana and \ncocaine after he had submitted his SF 86 in January 2020, that allegation is merely a \nrestatement of the facts that such use continued after that particular date, and it fails to \nstate any disqualifying conduct that actually differs from that already alleged. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 23-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor that is a management and information technology \nconsulting firm. It appears that he joined his employer sometime after April 2020. He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019, and was recognized as a college all-region scholar-\nathlete. There is an unverified indication that he may have received a master\u2019s degree. \nWhen completing his SF 86, he was candid in acknowledging that he had used marijuana \nand cocaine. He now claims that he will abstain from all illegal drug behavior, drug \ninvolvement, and substance misuse. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. He regularly purchased and \nused marijuana and periodically used cocaine, both controlled substances, for several \nyears, continuing to do so until as recently as March 2021 \u2013 approximately five months \nago. On several occasions in the past, he stated that he intended to continue using \nmarijuana in the future, and stated that he would no longer use cocaine. He continued to \nuse both substances. In addition, on two occasions in December 2017 and March 2018, \nhe also experimented with hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms \u2013 a Schedule I \nControlled Substance. It is also significant that he chose not to provide information of \nindividuals who were directly involved in his drug use. There is no evidence that he ever \nreceived treatment and counseling as a result of his illegal use of controlled substances. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse and his personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Item 3 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I \nconclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 3. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 3 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise an objection to Item 3 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond \nto the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n3 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not respond to the FORM \nor object to Item 3. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 44, has never been married nor has any children. He has resided \nwith a cohabitant since 2013. He received an associate degree in 1998. He has been \nemployed as a senior test technician by a defense contractor since January 2020. He \nwas previously granted a security clearance in 2010 while employed by another defense \ncontractor. (Item 2; Item 3 at 2) \nThe SOR alleged 34 delinquent debts totaling $118,405. In his SOR answer, \nApplicant admitted each alleged debt. The 2020 credit report upon which the SOR \nallegations were apparently based contained the following discrepancies: 1) the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.r was a duplicate of that in SOR \u00b6 1.q; 2) the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u and 1.v, as \nalleged, were not established; and 3) the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.z was a duplicate of that in \nSOR \u00b6 1.y. The following five medical debts contained in the credit report were not alleged \nin the SOR: $505 (acct # ending in 7854); $505 (acct # ending in 7911); $79 (acct # \nending in 3508); $454 (acct # ending in 3197); and $173 (acct # ending in 4283). Any \ndebts not alleged in the SOR will only be considered to evaluate mitigation and the whole-\nperson concept. According to his 2020 credit report, Applicant incurred 35 delinquent \ndebts totaling $118,711, including 29 medical accounts totaling $103,941; three utility \naccounts totaling $1,429; two automobile-loan accounts totaling $13,159; and one $172 \ncar insurance account. (Items 1, 4) \nApplicant attributed his medical debts to expenses he incurred after he was \ntransported via ambulance to hospitals in January 2015 and January 2017 following \nseizures of unknown origin. The duration of his respective hospital stays was \u201ca couple \nof days\u201d in 2015 and one day in 2017. He did not have health insurance during either \nstay. He maintained that he also did not have any other ability to pay those expenses. \nApplicant does not plan to pay any of the medical debts alleged in the SOR because he \nbelieves that he was overcharged. He asserted that he last received a call from a \ncollection company about a medical debt in 2018, but he did not answer. Thereafter, he \nblocked calls that he received from collection companies.

He claimed that he was deliberately overcharged by the hospitals so that \nthey could sell his debts to collection agencies and then take the tax write-off. He also \nasserted that he received limited services during his hospital stays; specifically, that his \nbasic vitals were monitored, but he received no other services because he did not have \ninsurance or other means to pay his bill. Although he could not recall the details of his \nbills, he believed that the majority of his medical debts related to his 2015 stay. He \nestimated that he was billed about $3,000 for his 2017 stay. While he did not recall how \nmuch he was billed for his 2015 stay, he believed that he should have only been charged \nabout $800 because he did not undergo any tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) scans.

According to his 2020 credit \nreport, collection companies were assigned the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.e in \nDecember 2012 and June 2017, respectively. The creditor charged off the account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d in September 2012. (Item 4 at 10, 16) \nApplicant provided details on only one of the two car-loan debts that were alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.hh. He asserted that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b related to a 2013 \nFord Escape that he financed in January 2015. He claimed that he was forced to accept \na predatory interest rate for the loan because he needed a car for transportation to work. \nHe explained that, after timely making payments on the loan for about six to eight months, \nhe voluntarily surrendered the car because his girlfriend\u2019s family had given him another \ncar for free and he no longer needed the Ford Escape. He also \u201cno longer wanted to \ncontinue expensive payments.\u201d He does not plan to repay this debt. He stated: \u201cThe loan \nwas predatory and there is nothing for me to gain by paying it.\u201d According to his 2020 \ncredit report, a collection company was assigned the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b in \nFebruary 2018, and the creditor charged off the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.hh in February \n2014. He did not address whether he planned to pay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.hh. \n(Item 2 at 31; Item 3 at 3; Item 4 at 10, 16) \nApplicant did not provide any details about the car-insurance debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, nor did he proffer a plan to repay it. According to his 2020 credit report, a collection \ncompany was assigned this debt in February 2019. (Item 4 at 9) \nApplicant described his financial situation optimistically during his July 2020 \nsecurity clearance interview. He stated that he was doing very well financially because \nhe was current with all of the bills for which he felt responsible, including his taxes. He \nattributed his medical and car-loan debts to price gouging and predatory practices, and \nnot to any irresponsibility on his part. He stated that he no longer had a car and, instead, \nrode a bike to work. At that time, he did not use credit cards or make purchases on credit \nbecause of his credit history. He indicated that he planned to try to clean up his credit in \nthe next few years. He also averred that he might file for bankruptcy at some point, but \nacknowledged that he had not yet taken any steps to do so.

He claimed that, because his work as \na graphic designer was boring and repetitive, he requested to be terminated so that he \ncould collect unemployment, which his supervisor obliged. During that period of \nunemployment, he was supported by unemployment compensation in an amount not \nspecified. (Item 2 at 12-16; Item 3 at 1-2) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v.

The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe Government did not proffer evidence sufficient to establish the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.z. Thus, I find those allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. The \nrecord evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline as \nto the remaining debts alleged in the SOR: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations); and AG \u00b6 19(b) (unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do \nso).

I considered that his indebtedness consists \nmostly of medical expenses he incurred during periods when he did not have health \ninsurance. However, Applicant did not meet his burden to establish that: 1) his income \nwas insufficient to meet those expenses, either at the time they were incurred or in \nsubsequent years; or 2) his decision to decline health insurance was a circumstance \nbeyond his control. Even assuming arguendo that one or more of the medical or other \nSOR debts were largely attributable to circumstances beyond his control, Applicant also \ndid not meet his burden to establish that he acted responsibly to resolve them. \nAlthough Applicant expressed potential bases to dispute the legitimacy of his \nmedical debts and the car-loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he neither established that \nthose bases were reasonable nor provided sufficient proof to substantiate the bases of \nthe disputes or evidence of actions he has taken to investigate or resolve the issues. \nFurther, he failed to establish that his indebtedness is not likely to recur and no longer \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He has not mitigated the \nGuideline F concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), and (e) are not established. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.s \u2013 1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.u \u2013 1.v: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.w \u2013 1.y: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.z: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He stated: I do not intend to use marijuana again for a number of reasons. I haven\u2019t used it since last year because of my wanting to focus on my last year of school, associated senior design project, and holding onto my (then) current employment. Future use is not considered because of the desire to secure and maintain a security clearance for [employer]. (Item 4) In July 2019, Applicant completed a new SCA. In it he disclosed that he used marijuana from April 2015 to July 2018. He stated: \u201cFrequency of use in previous 7 years was infrequent and sporadic.\u201d He further explained that marijuana was not addictive for him. He has used it voluntarily in the past. He mostly used it vaporizing and not smoking. He used it only in social settings. He has strong self-control, and said he had not used it in a year despite having it around him on multiple occasions and offered it to him by others. Over the years he has come",

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an answer to the SOR, and elected to have his case decided \non the written record in lieu of a hearing.1 Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on July 28, 2021. \nHe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 5. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM or object to any evidence offered. Items 2 through 5 are admitted into evidence. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 26, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He is not married \nand has no children. He has worked for the same employer, a federal contractor, since \nAugust 2012 and held a security clearance since then. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2012 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he \nused marijuana with varying frequency from about July 2007 until August 2011. He stated: \nI do not intend to use marijuana again for a number of reasons. I haven\u2019t \nused it since last year because of my wanting to focus on my last year of \nschool, associated senior design project, and holding onto my (then) current \nemployment. Future use is not considered because of the desire to secure \nand maintain a security clearance for [employer]. (Item 4) \nIn July 2019, Applicant completed a new SCA. In it he disclosed that he used \nmarijuana from April 2015 to July 2018. He stated: \u201cFrequency of use in previous 7 years \nwas infrequent and sporadic.\u201d He further explained that marijuana was not addictive for \nhim. He has used it voluntarily in the past. He mostly used it vaporizing and not smoking. \nHe used it only in social settings. He has strong self-control, and said he had not used it \nin a year despite having it around him on multiple occasions and offered it to him by \nothers. Over the years he has come to value his job more, which now surpasses his desire \nfor the psychoactive effects of marijuana use. He stated: \u201cMy responsibilities and desires \nin life far surpass those of my wants to temporarily alter my state of mind. This is why I \ndo not foresee using marijuana in the future.\u201d (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated he does not sell, possess or purchase \nmarijuana. All of his former use was in a state where marijuana is legal so those providing \nhim marijuana were doing so legally. He has not been diagnosed as dependent on \nmarijuana. His most recent use was July 2018. He does not intend to use marijuana in \nthe future because his job and career are more important to him than marijuana usage. \nHe noted that it had been a significant period of time since his last marijuana use. He \n1  The answer to the SOR is dated before the date of the SOR.

He then \nindicated removal as a scheduled drug from federal guidelines \u201cwould presumably \nremove marijuana as a prohibitive barrier to security clearance applicants and holders \n(akin to alcohol use), provided use is medicinal in nature and/or recreational and \nresponsibly administered.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that 17 states and the District of Colombia \nhave legalized marijuana, which represents the majority of the U.S. population and \n\u201ctherefore the People\u2019s belief that marijuana laws require a rewrite pertaining to its federal \nlegality and its potential for abuse.\u201d He then said that he \u201cnow considers the federal \nlegality of the substance and therefore the severity of its use in regards to potential for his \nexploitation with continued use.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that he estimated the frequency of his use from \nApril 2015 to July 2018 averaged less than once a month. He said that when he used \nmarijuana he took into account numerous variables prior to each engagement with its \nuse. He further explained that what he failed to take into account was his current \nclearance status and the impact its usage would have on his status. He said during the \ntimeframe he was using marijuana he did not do any work that required access to \nclassified material. He said he has matured and has a \u201cbetter intent\u201d to not use marijuana \nagain because of his growing responsibilities on DOD contracts. (Item 2) \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that he was unaware of the potential gravity \nor seriousness his infrequent use could have on national security if he was in possession \nof classified material. He stated he has every intention to no longer engage in the use of \nmarijuana. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about July 2007 until August \n2011. After being granted a security clearance in August 2012, Applicant used marijuana \nfrom about April 2015 to about July 2018. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use when first applying for a security clearance \nin 2012. He indicated in that application that he had not used marijuana for a significant \nperiod of time and did not intend to use it in the future because he wanted to focus on his \nfuture and his career. He was put on notice of the government\u2019s concerns that the use of \nillegal drugs was prohibited. He was then granted a security clearance and resumed using \nmarijuana from April 2015 to July 2018, while holding that clearance. \nWhen Applicant completed his 2019 SCA, he explained he had not used marijuana \nsince July 2018, because he was focusing on his future and his career. He provided \nexplanations and justifications for the minimal impact marijuana has had on his well\u00ad\nbeing. He also explained that although he had a security clearance, he did not have \naccess to classified material and that marijuana is legal in many states and is a Schedule \nI substance. \nApplicant fails to grasp that he was entrusted with a security clearance, and he \nrepeatedly violated that trust over a three-year period by using marijuana. He promised \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin his first SCA not to use marijuana in the future, and the government accepted his \nstatement. He repeated in his 2019 SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He attempted to minimize his conduct by providing a myriad of reasons for why \nmarijuana should be legalized under federal law or that it is the \u201cPeople\u2019s belief\u201d that the \nlaw should be changed. He continues to participate in social settings where marijuana is \nbeing used. He has shown that he can abstain from marijuana use, but repeatedly made \na conscious choice after his abstinence to use it while holding a security clearance. Based \non his past statements, promises, and conduct, I do not find Applicant\u2019s statements \ncredible. I am not convinced that future use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. I find his past \nbehavior was not infrequent, and it did not happen under unusual circumstances. I find \nhis conduct cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The \nabove mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since 2012 and \nheld a security clearance during this time. He has a long history of marijuana use. Despite \nhis statement in his 2012 SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, he \nresumed using it while holding a security clearance from April 2015 to July 2018. I am not \nconfident that Applicant has an appreciation for the seriousness of his conduct of violating \nthe trust given to him when he was granted a security clearance. The record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \na security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On May 31, 2021, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DODCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 7, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nreceived the request on August 23, 2021. I received the case assignment on August 23, \n2021.

He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is 39 years old, married, and has two children. He has a Master\u2019s of \nBusiness Administration degree. He works for a defense contractor. (TR at page 24 line \n6 to page 27 line 19.) \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement \n1.c and 1.d. Applicant first used marijuana, at times daily, from about November \n2004 to November 2006, when he was in his 20s. He also used marijuana on at least\ntwo occasions during the two year period from about March 2017 until March of 2019,\nwhile granted access to classified information. (TR at page 38 line 10 to page 45 line\n23, and at page 55 line 7 to page 56 line 9.) Applicant knew that his most recent usage\nwas contrary to the Federal drug policy. (Id.) \n \n \n \n \n1.a.

(TR at page 33 line 23 to page 38 line 9, and at page 66 lines\n7~20.) \n \n \n \nApplicant has, since May of 2019, completed drug awareness courses.

Applicant has formally \neschewed any future illegal drug abuse. (AppX B.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant smoked, cultivated and sold marijuana over a two and a half year \nperiod while holding a security clearance. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nAlthough Applicant signed an April 2021, sworn statement of intent as to future \ndrug involvement (AppX K), his involvement, while holding a security clearance, is too \nrecent to mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns. Drug involvement and substance misuse \nis found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is well respected in the \nworkplace. (TR at page 13 line 17 to page 23 line 3, and AppXs D, I and Q.) Overall, \nhowever, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 37, has worked for his current employer since November 2017. He completed a security clearance application, his first, in September 2019. He disclosed marijuana use between 2010 and 2019, to regulate the symptoms of a chronic medical condition. He also indicated his intent to continue using marijuana and briefly explained his attempts to obtain a medical marijuana allowance from his insurance provider. Information developed during the background investigation and adjudication process confirmed his history of marijuana use and his intent to continue to use the illegal drug. These facts form the basis of the SOR allegations in this case. (GE 3 \u2013 4) During his November 2019 subject interview, Applicant confirmed the information provided in his security clearance application. He disclosed that he used marijuana in October 2019 and that he uses the drug on weekends. He reiterated his intent to use the drug in the future, explaining that he understood that the federal law prohibited marijuana use. He conceded that he would stop using marijuana if directed to do so by his employer. (GE 4) In his April 2021 responses to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted that he continues to use marijuana on weekends.

Applicant is a current \nmarijuana user. He intends to use the drug in the future as a means of managing the \nsymptoms of a chronic medical condition. Though legal in his state of residence, \nmarijuana use remains illegal under federal law. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2021, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. This \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as \namended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, \n2017. DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether to deny his security \nclearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing. \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 2) The Government submitted its written case on July 21, \n2021. Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material July 27, 2021. \nHe did not respond. The documents appended to the FORM are admitted as GE 1 \nthrough 4, without objection. Applicant\u2019s signed FORM receipt is appended to the record \nas Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex. I) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 37, has worked for his current employer since November 2017. He \ncompleted a security clearance application, his first, in September 2019. He disclosed \nmarijuana use between 2010 and 2019, to regulate the symptoms of a chronic medical \ncondition. He also indicated his intent to continue using marijuana and briefly explained \nhis attempts to obtain a medical marijuana allowance from his insurance provider. \nInformation developed during the background investigation and adjudication process \nconfirmed his history of marijuana use and his intent to continue to use the illegal drug. \nThese facts form the basis of the SOR allegations in this case. (GE 3 \u2013 4) \nDuring his November 2019 subject interview, Applicant confirmed the information \nprovided in his security clearance application. He disclosed that he used marijuana in \nOctober 2019 and that he uses the drug on weekends. He reiterated his intent to use \nthe drug in the future, explaining that he understood that the federal law prohibited \nmarijuana use. He conceded that he would stop using marijuana if directed to do so by \nhis employer. (GE 4) \nIn his April 2021 responses to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted that he \ncontinues to use marijuana on weekends. He now has a medical marijuana card and \nadmits to purchasing the drug at a legally sanctioned medical marijuana dispensary in \nthe state where he lives. He reaffirmed his intention to continue using marijuana in the \nfuture and admitted to having unused drugs and a pipe for smoking marijuana in his \nhome at the time he completed the interrogatories. (GE 4) \nIn his June 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation that he \npurchased and used marijuana between 2005 and April 2021. He also admitted making \nstatements in his November 2020 subject interview and April 2021 interrogatory \nresponse that he intended to use marijuana in the future. (GE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis  \nThe record contains evidence to support the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant engaged in disqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. He did not provide any evidence to mitigate any of the alleged \nconcerns. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant admits using marijuana from at least 2005 to at least April 2021. During \nhis background investigation, Applicant stated his intent to continue using marijuana in \nthe future. The illegal use of controlled substances can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because such behavior may lead to physical \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Whole-person Concept \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 16) The following \ndisqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 17(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 17(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nNone of the relevant mitigating conditions apply. Although the medical use of \nmarijuana may be decriminalized in Applicant\u2019s state of residency, this does not alter \nfederal law or existing National Security Guidelines. No state can authorize the violation \nof federal law. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use violates the Controlled Substances Act, which \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Under the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Action (IRTPA), as amended, federal agencies remain prohibited \nfrom granting a security clearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance. (See \nDirector of National Intelligence Memorandum, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use, dated November 17, 2014) \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. This decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts \nunder the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, which \nhe believes is the best method of managing the symptoms of his medical condition, \nviolates federal law. This conflict of interest, which Applicant resolved in his favor, casts \ndoubt on his trustworthiness and reliability. The evidence suggests that he will resolve \nother potential conflicts of interests in a similar manner. Applicant\u2019s current and ongoing \nuse of marijuana, even for medical purposes, is incompatible with the interests of the \nnational security. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor since May 2019. Applicant attended high school from 1998 to 2000, but did not graduate. He was laid off from his previous employer in November 2018 and remained unemployed until May 2019. Applicant is unmarried and has no children. He has never held a security clearance. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on debts totaling about $23,688 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g). The debts alleged are supported by the Government\u2019s credit reports and Applicant\u2019s Answer, SCA, and 2020 interview summary. He admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. He avers that his current debts are a result of his unemployment, and his past debts that were paid via a consolidation loan resulted from underemployment. Applicant stated in his Answer that all of the debts alleged except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were paid or otherwise resolved. He stated that SOR \u00b6 1.b was consolidated under the consolidation loan alleged as SOR \u00b6 1.c.

On April 26, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F.

Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor since May 2019. \nApplicant attended high school from 1998 to 2000, but did not graduate. He was laid off \nfrom his previous employer in November 2018 and remained unemployed until May 2019. \nApplicant is unmarried and has no children. He has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on debts totaling \nabout $23,688 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g). The debts alleged are supported by the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports and Applicant\u2019s Answer, SCA, and 2020 interview summary. He admitted \nall of the SOR allegations with explanations. He avers that his current debts are a result \nof his unemployment, and his past debts that were paid via a consolidation loan resulted \nfrom underemployment. \nApplicant stated in his Answer that all of the debts alleged except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c were paid or otherwise resolved. He stated that SOR \u00b6 1.b was consolidated under \nthe consolidation loan alleged as SOR \u00b6 1.c. With his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nprovided documentation showing he resolved a payday-loan-collection-account alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. Department Counsel acknowledged in the FORM that Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport shows SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e have been resolved. \nApplicant submitted a partial credit report that shows a series of \u201cclosed\u201d accounts, \nwith little other relevant information. In addition, he provided a debt relief negotiation \nagreement from May 2021. In the agreement, Applicant provided authorization for the \ndebt relief company to negotiate resolution of two debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, \ncomprising a retail credit-card account that was charged off in the approximate amount \nof $570; and a consolidation loan that was charged off in the approximate amount of \n$12,628. Of note, the debt relief company charged $2,903 in \u201cnegotiation fees,\u201d and \nrequires Applicant to submit $300 monthly payments for 30 months, beginning in May \n2021. No evidence of compliance with these terms was submitted. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. In 2017, he applied for and \nreceived a debt consolidation loan, totaling $12,927 at 29.7% interest rate, to be applied \ntoward seven delinquent debts totaling $13,163.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

While his income was likely a significant contributing factor, he has \nnot shown sufficient effort and dedication to resolving the debts.

Three of the seven SOR debts \nhave been resolved, however four remain unresolved, with the most significant debt for \n$12,628, remaining. \nApplicant has a long history of financial delinquencies. I am not persuaded that he \nhas regained control of his finances, has showed financial responsibility, or is diligent \nabout meeting his financial responsibilities. In addition, I am unclear as to why Applicant \nfailed to pay off debts since being employed in May 2019, and substantially ignored his \ndebts until his security eligibility was questioned. \nApplicant chose to have a decision issued on the record, but has done little to \nprovide persuasive mitigating information for my consideration, or to fully explain his \nfinancial history, current financial status, or his inability or unwillingness to meet financial \nobligations. I am not persuaded that Applicant has a handle on all of his debts, has taken \nsufficient action to resolve those that remain, or has shown financial responsibility over \nthe years. As a result, and without more documentary evidence, I remain doubtful about \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant is credited for resolving the accounts that I noted as resolved, but he \nfailed to show that continued delinquencies are unlikely to recur. Additionally, I am not \npersuaded that the conditions that resulted in his financial problems were largely beyond \nhis control, or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Finally, he has not \nshown that he initiated and is adhering to good-faith efforts to repay the remaining \ncreditors or otherwise resolve the remaining debts. For these reasons, none of the \nmitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment history. However, he has not provided sufficient evidence to \nshow the resolution of the remaining SOR debts and his overall financial responsibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e: \n  Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g:\nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Key code \nsecurity did not reveal a building access code used for Applicant at all during his shift. \n(Item 6) \nWhen asked by his supervisor whether he came to work the previous night, \nApplicant replied that he never intended to come to work that night and could not be \nsure why he could have texted his superior at 1:00 AM in the morning to confirm he had \nbeen at work that night. (Item 4) For in fact, he never reported for work that night. \nTo be sure, Applicant had been at a local casino that same January 2020 \nevening. (Item 5) Pressed by his supervisor about his early morning text confirming his \nreporting to work, Applicant replied that he was drunk when he texted him and never \nreported for work. (Item 6) \nWhen Applicant received no answer to his inquiry of whether his January 2020 \nfalse reporting incident would result in his termination, he made the decision to quit his \njob and exited the conference room. (Item 6) Although he was not given a definitive \nanswer immediately, he was later advised that he had been involuntarily terminated \nfrom his job for cause. (Item 6) \nApplicant does not dispute the facts and circumstances surrounding the January \n2020 false reporting incident. While accepting full responsibility for it, he claims it was \nan isolated incident that will not recur. (Items 2 and 7) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, and trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s admitted falsification of his text \nmessage of January 2020 confirming his showing up for work in January 2020, when he \nhad not. Personal conduct concerns cover his termination of employment and non-\neligibility for return by his then-employer after testing being terminated for cause. \nApplicable to Applicant\u2019s situation based on his pleading admission and findings, \nis DC \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is \nnot limited to consideration of: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n  \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release \nof sensitive corporate or other government protected information; and \n   (3)  a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \nWhile Applicant\u2019s falsification of his shift time might by itself be considered an isolated \nevent, his failure to fully own up to his mistake in candor and judgment with his \nsupervisor, human resources representative, investigating OPM investigator, and in his \nSOR response only compounds his lapse in candor and judgment reflected in his \nfalsifying his shift time the previous day. \nBecause of the absence of any documented remorse or other indicated steps by \nApplicant to ensure that similar-type incidents involving candor and judgment lapses do \nnot recur, Applicant may not take advantage of any of the potentially available mitigating \nconditions. More documented evidence of positive character reinforcements are needed \nfrom Applicant to provide reliable assurances that his false reporting of his shift status \nwas an isolated lapse in candor and judgment that poses no risk of recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n   \n                           \n \n \n \n        \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his reported false text to his supervisor confirming his showing \nup for his work shift the previous day can be mitigated without substantial \ncounterbalancing evidence of positive character endorsements and other evidence of \ndemonstrated trustworthiness. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his civilian \ncontributions to the defense industry, he provided no positive reinforcements of his \noverall trustworthiness to surmount the isolated, but nonetheless serious breach of the \ncandor and judgment eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. Without \nstrong positive evidence of overall good character to counterbalance his candor and \njudgment lapses and absorb risks of future recurrences of candor and judgment \nbreaches, mitigation is not available to Applicant at this time. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n GUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT): \n  Subparagraphs 1.a: \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old solutions engineer for a government contractor since November 2019. Applicant attended college but did not attain a degree. He received a correctional officer certification in 2003. He served in the active Army National Guard from 2001 to 2004, and on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2004 to 2014, He was honorably discharged from both. He married his current spouse in 2018. He was previously married from 2001 to 2004, 2005 to 2010, and from 2010 to 2013. He divorced each time. He has three children. He was last granted a secret security clearance in approximately 2010. The SOR alleges Applicant has four delinquent debts that are in collections or charged off, totaling about $34,000. Applicant admitted debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. He noted that while he was in the Marine Corps, he went through a difficult divorce where his spouse obtained several loans allegedly with a power of attorney before his divorce, in which he was responsible. He said he disputed the loans, but they have not been removed from his credit report. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a credit union auto loan that has been charged off for approximately $21,661. The delinquent loan is reflected in Applicant\u2019s April and October 2020 credit reports as an individual account in his name for $27,843, assigned in 2011, with the last account activity occurring on September 2020, and a charged-off balance of $21,661.

The case was \nassigned to me on September 20, 2021. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. \nThe Government asked me to consider allegations of criminal misconduct while \nApplicant was on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps, in my whole-person analysis. \nAccording to GE 9, an FBI rap sheet, two military criminal charges were dismissed in \n2013. GE 10 contains various criminal investigative reports and statements. The Exhibits \ncontain information about certain incidents that were not included in the SOR, and \nApplicant did not have an opportunity to comment on them in his Answer to the SOR \n(although he could have provided comments had he responded to the FORM). \nDepartment Counsel did not present a persuasive case in the FORM for their \nconsideration. Despite Applicant\u2019s military disciplinary record, he received honorable \ndischarges from the Army National Guard in 2004 and from the Marine Corps in 2014. I \nfind GEs 9 and 10 discussing alleged criminal misconduct to be irrelevant to this financial \ncase, significantly outdated, and insufficient to prejudice Applicant\u2019s propensity for \ntruthfulness and reliability. Therefore, GEs 9 and 10 are not admitted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old solutions engineer for a government contractor since \nNovember 2019. Applicant attended college but did not attain a degree. He received a \ncorrectional officer certification in 2003. He served in the active Army National Guard from \n2001 to 2004, and on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2004 to 2014, He was \nhonorably discharged from both.

Applicant admitted debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, and denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. He noted that while he was in the Marine Corps, he went \nthrough a difficult divorce where his spouse obtained several loans allegedly with a power \nof attorney before his divorce, in which he was responsible. He said he disputed the loans, \nbut they have not been removed from his credit report. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a credit union auto loan that has been charged off for \napproximately $21,661. The delinquent loan is reflected in Applicant\u2019s April and October \n2020 credit reports as an individual account in his name for $27,843, assigned in 2011, \nwith the last account activity occurring on September 2020, and a charged-off balance of \n$21,661. No account dispute is noted in the credit reports. Applicant claimed in his Answer \nthat the loan was for a vehicle that he was \u201crequired by my Marine Corps command to \ngive to my wife while we were going through the divorce and she decided to call the bank \nand had it repossessed since she had possession of it.\u201d He stated that he disputed the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepossession and refused to pay the loan balance since the credit union took the car \nagainst his wishes.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient to \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant claims to have incurred most of his debts as a result of his contentious \nrelationship with his ex-spouse. The debts are long-standing, remain continued concerns, \nand impugn his financial status. Although his financial condition may have been \ncompromised by her actions, he has not shown sufficient evidence to support improper \nor unauthorized financial activity, or efforts to resolve the debts. He may have disputed \nthem, but the record does not reflect that or other actions to resolve the financial \nallegations or contest them. Based on the record presented, I am not persuaded that \nthese debts have been resolved or do not continue to present financial security concerns. \nI also have not been presented with evidence showing Applicant\u2019s current financial status, \nability to pay debts and expenses in a timely manner, and any financial counseling to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nassist him in not repeating past financial mistakes.

As a result, \nand without more documentary evidence, I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. For these reasons, none of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and difficulties with his marital relationships. However, he has \nnot provided sufficient evidence to show the resolution of the SOR debts and his overall \nfinancial responsibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant admits all of the all debts listed in the SOR, \nexcept 1.c. Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 1, 2020, and June 29, 2021, \nconfirm the indebtedness.

Applicant has been married \nsince February 2015. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s children reside with him. \n(Government \nExhibit 4.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant failed to provide any explanation for his \nexcessive delinquent indebtedness. He also failed to provide any information showing \nany attempts on his part to contact the creditors and repay or resolve his delinquent \ndebts. \nApplicant failed to disclose any of these delinquent debts on his 2020 security \nclearance application. During his subject interview in December 2020, he discussed a \ndelinquent car loan and three medical accounts. \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a.  A delinquent debt is owed to a state department of social service for child support \narrearage in the amount of $14,970.  Applicant had an active warrant that was issued in \nJanuary 2020 for unpaid child support.  The warrant was recalled by the court in \nDecember 2020.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant is indebted to a number of creditors for delinquent accounts totaling in \nexcess of $24,000 that have been placed for collection or are in arrears. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nand    \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted to each of the creditors set forth in the SOR. \nHe has failed to provide any evidence in mitigation. This shows poor judgment and \nunreliability. Accordingly, Applicant does not meet the requirements to access classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",
