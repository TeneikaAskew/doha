Mendez, Esq., and Tovah Minster, Esq. \nDepartment Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn March 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 13, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 7, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 11, 2009. I convened the hearing as \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nscheduled on March 27, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. The Government also offered a \ndemonstrative exhibit that was marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and \noffered Exhibits (AE) A through G. The record was held open to allow Applicant an \nopportunity to provide an additional exhibit which she did and it was marked as AE H. \nDepartment Counsel provided a written response (HE II) and did not object. The exhibit \nwas admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 3, 2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old program manager for a federal contractor. She has an \nassociate degree, a bachelors of arts degree and a masters of business degree. She is \na single mother with one daughter. She does not receive child support.1  \n \n \nPrior to 2000, Applicant was in a relationship and her boyfriend\u2019s car broke down. \nShe cosigned a car loan for him. They broke up and in 2000 he stopped making \npayments on the loan and defaulted on the loan. He then filed for bankruptcy and had \nthe debt discharged. He did not tell Applicant he had defaulted on the loan or had it \ndischarged in bankruptcy. Applicant also had a car loan on her vehicle and was unable \nto make two car payments at that time. She filed for bankruptcy and the two car loan \ndebts were discharged. There were other debts included in the bankruptcy, but \nApplicant chose to pay them. Applicant was a recent college graduate at the time, \nworking as a receptionist in a low paying job.2  \n \n \nApplicant was financially solvent and bought a home in December 2004. In June \n2005, she had an accident and injured her knee. She was unable to work and was on \ndisability for six months receiving only 60% of her salary. She started to get behind in \npaying her bills. She was able to use her 2005 tax return check to catch up on some of \nher bills. She usually was no more than two months behind. She was on disability from \nSeptember 2005 to February 2006, when she went back to work.3 \n \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant learned she was pregnant. In November 2006 she \nhad complications with her pregnancy and was put on bed rest for the duration of her \npregnancy. Applicant was required to go back on disability. She got behind with her \nmortgage payments and attempted to sell her home, but could not and it was eventually \n \n1 Tr. 54-57. \n \n2 Tr. 22-24. \n \n3 Tr. 24-28. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nforeclosed. She did not owe anything on the home after the foreclosure. In July 2007 \nshe returned to work. Again she had difficulty with her finances.4 \n \n \nApplicant hired a credit repair service in August 2007 to help her dispute some \ndebts she disagreed with and to help her set up payment plans for others. The service \nwas able to clear up some of the disputed debts. Specifically they resolved the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,014). Applicant had returned defective phones to the company and had \nthe receipt as proof. However, the phone company refused to remove the debt until the \ncredit repair service communicated with them. It has been removed from her credit \nreport.5 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h is for a car loan ($4,663). In 2004, Applicant was engaged \nto a man and she took a loan to purchase a car for him. He was then laid off and she \nwas later placed on disability. She would fall behind in her payments and then get \ncaught up. In October 2007, she contacted the creditor and discussed her situation. She \nwas told that she could return the car and the debt would be satisfied. She did not \nunderstand that the return would be considered a repossession. When she found out \nthe debt was on the SOR in March 2009 and delinquent she attempted to contact the \noriginal creditor and could only reach an answer machine. She repeatedly attempted to \ncontact the original creditor. She then sent an email to the creditor. She also tried to \ncontact the collection company and sent them an email and a fax. Her credit repair \nservice also tried contacting both the original creditor and the collection agency. \nApplicant then received a call from a second collection agency who stated they had \nbeen hired by the first collection agency and they wanted her to provide her bank \naccount information over the phone. Applicant refused to do so without written \nverification. This company refused to provide any details about the debt unless she \nacquiesced to providing her account information by phone. She was threatened by this \nagency. She then was told if she faxed a request for documented information they could \nprovide her details. She faxed them a letter and they have never responded. Applicant \ntook copious chronological notes and provided copies of her emails and fax \ntransmissions.6 \n \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant again contacted the original creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h in an effort to resolve the debt. They were responsive this time and she was \nprovided with a detailed break down of the debt and she worked out a payment plan. \nThe original creditor acknowledged they still owned the debt, but then changed their \nanswer a few days later stating the debt was actually owned by a collection agency. \nApplicant has agreed to a settlement offer to pay $2,623. She will make $326 payments \nevery two weeks for four months. The payments were supposed to start on May 22, \n2009, through an automatic withdrawal from her account. Applicant had provided the \ncreditor all of the accounting data to set up the withdrawal. She has repeatedly \n \n4 Tr. 28-29, 53-54. \n \n5 Tr. 30. \n \n6 Tr. 31-43; AE E and F. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ncontacted the creditor and left messages that the amount has yet to be taken from her \naccount. The creditor has not responded to her messages. She will continue to pursue \nresolving the debt and has willingly set up a payment plan, but the creditor is not \ncooperating.7  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a tax lien ($830) Applicant was unaware about until she \nreceived the SOR. She contacted the comptroller of the state that held the lien. She \nlearned that a tax consequence occurred when she took money out of her 401k \naccount. She paid the debt.8 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are for medical services ($57 and $37). \nApplicant was unaware of these debts until receiving the SOR. Her medical insurance \nwas to pay these debts, but the debts were listed incorrectly by the creditor at the time \nand the insurance company refused to pay them. Applicant paid the debts and provided \nsupporting documents.9 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a credit card debt ($439) that went delinquent when \nApplicant was on disability. She contacted the creditor and paid the debt and provided \nsupporting documents.10 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($2,441) is a credit card debt. Applicant used her tax \nrefund to pay the debt in 2007, but did not realize there were additional charges to her \naccount. She had her credit repair service attempt to resolve the debt. The account had \nbeen referred to a law firm. Applicant settled the debt for $1,718 in March 2009 and \nprovided supporting documents.11 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b61.g is a medical debt ($2,000) incurred when Applicant gave \nbirth to her daughter. Apparently there were two anesthesiologists in the operating room \nand the insurance company only authorized payment for one. Applicant had not \nrequested the additional doctor. The account went to a collection company. Applicant \ncontacted a representative in March 2009 and set up a payment plan. Applicant pays \n$200 a month and has made two payments. The debt will be completely paid off in \nOctober 2009. Although she disputes the validity of this debt, she decided to pay it so it \nwould not affect her job.12 \n \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 Tr. 43-44; Answer to SOR with supporting documentation showing the debt is paid. \n \n9 Tr. 44-45; AE A. \n \n10 Tr. 45-47; AE B and G. \n \n11 Tr. 47-49; AE C and D. \n \n12 Tr. 49-52; AE H. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant credibly testified that once she was resumed work and was off disability \nshe was able to get her finances in order, save some money, and pay her debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s salary increased by 5% this year and she also was recently \npromoted. She does not have any other outstanding debts and lives within her means. \nShe is paying her monthly obligations on time. She has not received any financial \ncounseling. She testified she had a couple of years of bad luck that negatively affected \nher finances, but has done everything she could to pay her debts.13  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n \n13 Tr. 61-67. \n\n \n6 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant had her debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2000. She then accumulated \nnumerous delinquent debts that were unpaid for a period of time. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because she had many delinquent debts that only \nrecently were paid and others that she is paying through payment plans. I find mitigating \ncondition (a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant made some poor financial choices and then had medical problems and \nwas unable to work. Her income was decreased because she was placed on disability \nduring two long periods of time. She incurred significant debt by cosigning on a loan that \nwas then defaulted on, leaving her with the financial obligation. This condition was \nsomewhat beyond her control, but not entirely, as she made a conscious decision to be \nresponsible for the debt. Once she resumed her job full time and was receiving her full \npay she worked towards paying her outstanding debts. I find that some of the conditions \nthat resulted in Applicant\u2019s financial problems were beyond her control and others were \nnot. I also find that once she was able she acted responsibly in resolving her delinquent \ndebts. Therefore, mitigating condition (b) partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant has contacted her creditors and paid most of her debts or has \nnegotiated payment plans and is paying. She has done all that she can do to resolve \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. She set up the payment plan and the automatic withdrawal, but \nthe creditor has repeatedly been uncooperative and unresponsive. She has made a \ngood-faith effort to resolve this debt. Applicant is living within her means and has paid \nher delinquent debts. I find mitigating conditions (c) and (d) apply. \n \n \nApplicant disputed one of her debts because she had returned the equipment \nand the creditor failed to cooperate with her until her credit repair service communicated \nwith them. I find mitigating condition (e) applies.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young woman who \nmade some financial mistakes and had some medical problems that affected her \nincome. She had two significant periods of time where she was on disability and her \nincome was reduced. This affected her ability to pay her bills and she got behind. Once \nshe resumed work full-time she paid many of her delinquent debts and has set up \npayment plans for the remaining debts. Although Applicant may have made some poor \nfinancial decisions that caused her to incur some debts she has not avoided their \nrepayment. Applicant has addressed all of her delinquent debts. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly with in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline J, the government alleged that, between 2000 and 2002, Applicant was arrested for, charged with, or convicted of a criminal offense ten times.

Under Guideline G, the government alleged that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times to excess, since he was 17 years old, with the last known incident of intoxication on November 6, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that in November 2007, he was fired as a result of his alcohol use (SOR \u00b6 2.b); and that after his DUI convictions in January 2000 and April 2002 (see SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.j), he was ordered to attend alcohol related classes (SOR \u00b6 2.d).

Under Guideline E, the government alleged that, when Applicant submitted his e- QIP in January 2008, he deliberately falsified his answers to e-QIP questions 23.c 4 (current criminal charges pending), 23.d (alcohol or drug-related charges), and 23.f (arrests or charges not addressed elsewhere in question 23) by omitting the arrests listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c - 1.g and 1.f (SOR \u00b6 3.a).

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a set of interrogatories  to clarify or augment information about\n1\npotentially disqualifying information in his background. After reviewing the results of the\nbackground investigation and Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories, DOHA\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n2\nApril 2, 2010\n\n The adjudicative guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were implemented\n3\nby the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive, they take\nprecedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n The SOR \u00b6 3 allegations erroneously stated that Applicant had falsified a \u201cQuestionnaire for National Security\n4\nPositions\u201d as opposed to an e-QIP; however, this appears to have been a typographical error.\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation. On May 28, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG)  under Guideline G (alcohol consumption), Guideline J\n3\n(criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, provided documents in support of his\nrequest for eligibility, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on\nNovember 9, 2009, and I convened a hearing on December 16, 2009, at which the\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented 14 exhibits (Gx. 1 - 14), all\nof which I admitted. However, Gx. 4 - 13 were admitted over Applicant\u2019s objections (Tr.\n32 - 46). Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of hearing\n(Tr.) on December 28, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged that, between 2000 and 2002,\nApplicant was arrested for, charged with, or convicted of a criminal offense ten times.\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j) Applicant admitted these allegations, six of which (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c,\n1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j) were alcohol-related offenses, such as driving under the influence\n(DUI), driving while intoxicated (DWI), operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated\n(OWI), and having an open container of alcohol in the car.\nUnder Guideline G, the government alleged that Applicant has consumed\nalcohol, at times to excess, since he was 17 years old, with the last known incident of\nintoxication on November 6, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that in November 2007, he was fired as\na result of his alcohol use (SOR \u00b6 2.b); and that after his DUI convictions in January\n2000 and April 2002 (see SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.j), he was ordered to attend alcohol related\nclasses (SOR \u00b6 2.d). The government also cross-alleged his alcohol-related arrests\nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant admitted these\nallegations.\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged that, when Applicant submitted his e-\nQIP  in January 2008, he deliberately falsified his answers to e-QIP questions 23.c\n4\n(current criminal charges pending), 23.d (alcohol or drug-related charges), and 23.f\n(arrests or charges not addressed elsewhere in question 23) by omitting the arrests\nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c - 1.g and 1.f (SOR \u00b6 3.a). The government further alleged that\nApplicant falsified his e-QIP when he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 25 (alcohol-related\ncounseling or treatment in the past seven years) (SOR \u00b6 3.b); and that he deliberately\nfalsified his e-QIP when he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 22 (job termination under adverse\ncircumstances in the past seven years) (SOR \u00b6 3.c). In his answer, Applicant admitted\n\n3\nthese allegations, but at hearing he testified it was not his intent to lie or to mislead the\ngovernment. In addition to the facts established through his admissions in response to\nthe SOR, and after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and exhibits, I have made\nthe following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 31 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a project\nsupport technician. He has worked for his current employer since January 2008. For\nmost of that time, he has been assigned to an overseas job site in support of military\noperations. Applicant served in the United States Marine Corps from July 1996 until July\n2001, but he was unable to find work after his discharge. In November 2001, he enlisted\nin the United States Army, where he served until he was honorably discharged in\nNovember 2006. Thereafter, he worked for two defense contractors, also overseas,\nbefore he was hired by his current employer. He has held a security clearance for about\nten years. (Gx. 1; Gx. 14)\nApplicant has never been married. He has three children (ages 10, 8 and 2) by\ntwo women to whom he pays child support. He either shares custody with them or has\nvisitation privileges. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2)\nApplicant\u2019s job performance since January 2008 has been very good. The\nperformance appraisals and letters he forwarded with his response to the SOR show\nhim to be an accomplished, valuable employee with potential for continued\nadvancement. His co-workers, military customers, and supervisors support renewal of\nhis security clearance based on his integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nInformation obtained during Applicant\u2019s background investigation showed that he\nwas, as alleged, arrested or charged with criminal offenses ten times between 2000 and\n2006. While he was in the Marines, Applicant was arrested for DUI in January 2000. In\nMarch 2000, he was arrested and charged with failure to appear to answer the January\n2000 DUI charge. For the DUI charge, he was placed on probation for 12 months,\nordered to abstain from alcohol, and ordered to attend a civilian alcohol safety\nawareness class. Also, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 12 months and he was\nordered by the Marines to receive alcohol counseling at his duty station. (Gx. 2; Gx. 3;\nGx. 10; Gx. 12) In July 2000, he was arrested for driving on the license that was\nsuspended when he was convicted of the January 2000 DUI. (Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Gx. 10)\nIn September 2000, Applicant again was charged with driving under a suspended\nlicense, possession of an open container of alcohol, and failure to comply with part of\nthe court\u2019s sentence from his January 2000 arrest. Attached to these charges was a\ncharge of violating the terms of his probation. Applicant was fined but there is no\ninformation showing that his probation was extended or that he was incarcerated as a\nresult of these offenses. Applicant stated in his response to interrogatories that his\nprobation officer \u201conly recommended fines.\u201d(Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Gx. 9)\nIn May 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with OWI, resisting arrest,\nreckless driving, and speeding. He was originally stopped after police clocked him doing\n70 mph in a 25 mph zone. On July 15, 2001, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest\nwhen he failed to appear to answer the May 2001 OWI charges. (Gx. 8)\n\n Applicant was in the state where he was cited for speeding only because he was assigned there by the Army.\n5\n4\nIn August 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with speeding, operating a\nmotor vehicle without a license, operating a vehicle without financial responsibility, and\ntwo other minor infractions. (Gx. 6) There is no information regarding the court\ndisposition of these offenses. \nOn September 29, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with reckless\ndriving, DWI, and resisting arrest. On June 20, 2002, a bench warrant for Applicant\u2019s\narrest was issued after he failed to appear to respond to these charges. His license was\nsuspended for 30 days, he was fined and assessed court costs, and he was sentenced\nto 190 days in jail, of which 175 days was suspended. (Gx. 2; Gx. 5)\nIn April 2002, after he had enlisted in the Army, he was arrested near his duty\nstation and charged with speeding and DUI. He was convicted, placed on 12 months\nprobation, and ordered to attend an alcohol safety awareness course. (Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Gx.\n4)\nIn 2005, Applicant was given a speeding ticket. In the state where this occurred,\nbecause Applicant already had more than six points against his license for other\nviolations, he was required, in addition to the speeding penalty, to pay $100 annually to\nthe motor vehicle administration. Applicant did not receive notice of this assessment\nbecause it was sent to his home of record  in another state. Also, Applicant deployed to\n5\nIraq with the Army soon after he answered the speeding summons. In 2006, when he\nreturned from Iraq, and prior to his November 2006 discharge, Applicant was again\nstopped on base for a traffic violation, and it was determined that his license had been\nsuspended because he had not met the state requirement for additional payments. He\nwas arrested and taken to jail until he was released to his superiors. (Answer to SOR;\nGx. 2; Tr. 54 - 55, 63 - 64)\nIn November 2007, Applicant\u2019s civilian employer assigned him to a team of\nmilitary and civilian personnel deploying overseas to conduct military air traffic control\noperations. En route to their destination, the team had an overnight layover. The team\nstayed at a hotel off base between flights. Applicant and other members of the team\nwent out in town. However, Applicant returned late and with very little time left before\nthe team left for the airport. He was also inebriated when he returned. The military team\nleader directed that Applicant be sent home. When he returned to the United States, he\nwas fired. Applicant has averred that he should not have been fired because he was\nnever told he could not drink, and because his drinking was only \u201ca little bit of\nconsumption.\u201d However, at hearing he acknowledged that he was drunk when he\nreturned to the hotel. (Tr. 58 - 59, 79, 81 - 82, 90 - 96)\nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in January 2008 (Gx. 1), in response to\nquestions 23.d (Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related\nto alcohol or drugs?) (emphasis added), he listed only his 2002 DUI arrest and\nconviction, but omitted his alcohol-related arrests or charges in September 2001, July\n2001, May 2001, September 2000, and January 2000. \n\n5\nIn response to e-QIP question 23.f (In the last 7 years, have you been arrested\nfor, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to [e-QIP\nquestions 23] a, b, c, d, or e, above?), he answered \u201cno,\u201d thereby omitting his 2006\narrest for driving under a suspended license, his August 2001 arrest for driving without a\nlicense, his July 2001 arrest for failure to appear, his July 2000 arrest for driving on a\nsuspended license, and his March 2000 arrest for failure to appear.\nIn response to e-QIP question 25 (In the last 7 years has your use of alcoholic\nbeverages...resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol\nabuse or alcoholism)?), he answered \u201cno,\u201d thereby omitting the fact that he had been\nordered to complete alcohol awareness classes on at least three occasions. In\nresponse to e-QIP question 22 (Has any of the following happened to you in the last 7\nyears? 1. Fired from a job; 2. Quit after being told you\u2019d be fired; 3. Left a job by mutual\nagreement following allegations of misconduct; 4. Left a job by mutual agreement\nfollowing allegations of unsatisfactory job performance; 5. Left a job for other reasons\nunder unfavorable circumstances.), he answered \u201cno,\u201d thereby omitting the fact that he\nwas fired from his previous job in November 2007.\nIn response to allegations that he intentionally omitted adverse information when\nhe submitted his e-QIP, Applicant stated variously that he did not understand the\nquestions, that he forgot about all of his arrests, or that he did not have enough\ninformation about the requested information. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 55 - 57, 82 - 83) As to\nhis 2006 arrest, he did not think \u201cit would be published.\u201d (Tr. 55) As to his answer to e-\nQIP question 23.d, he averred that he thought the question only required him to disclose\narrests in the past seven years. However, Applicant also acknowledged that the e-QIP\nhe submitted in January 2008 was at least the third such questionnaire he has\nsubmitted to obtain a clearance since 1996. (Tr. 62 - 63)\nApplicant began drinking alcohol at about age 17. When he was at his first\nassignment with the Marines in 1997 and 1998, he drank to intoxication twice weekly.\nBy January 2000, he drank to intoxication twice monthly. When he joined the Army in\nNovember 2001, his drinking increased to twice weekly intoxication, which continued,\nwhen he was not deployed overseas, until his April 2002 DUI arrest, after which he\nabstained from alcohol for an unspecified period. A counselor in his most recent court-\nordered ASAP class advised him he thought Applicant had a drinking problem. (Gx. 2)\nApplicant last consumed alcohol a few days before the hearing when he shared a\nsix-pack of beer with his uncle. At the hearing, he said he planned to go out drinking\nwith friends before he returned to his overseas job site in December 2009 or January\n2010. He also allowed that he can drink as many as 12 beers in a day while at a\nbarbeque with family and friends. Alcohol is prohibited at his job site by order of the\nmilitary commanders there, so the only time Applicant drinks is when he comes back to\nthe United States on leave. The last time he was intoxicated was in November 2008.\n(Gx. 2; Tr. 86 - 91) \n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n Directive. 6.3.\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n6\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n7\nin the adjudicative guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct), AG \u00b6 21 (Guideline\nG - Alcohol Consumption), and AG \u00b6 30 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n8\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.9\n\n7\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe government\u2019s information is sufficient to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a\n- 1.j. Specifically, Applicant was arrested or charged with criminal offenses ten times\nbetween 2000 and 2006. On six occasions, Applicant was either driving while impaired\nby alcohol or had an open container of alcohol in his car while he was driving. On two\noccasions, he failed to appear in court to answer drunk driving charges. As to SOR \u00b6\n1.e, the record does not show that there is still an outstanding  warrant, as alleged, for\nhis arrest for failing to appear after his May 2001 DWI arrest. Nonetheless, the record\nshows that he did not appear as required but that he eventually was tried and convicted\nof the DWI offense. All of the information presented, including Applicant\u2019s admissions,\nraises a security concern that is expressed at AG \u00b6 30 as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nFurther, available information requires application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\n31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted), and AG \u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or\nprobation). Because he repeatedly drove on a driver\u2019s license that was suspended by\ndifferent states for different alcohol-related driving offenses, I conclude that AG \u00b6 31(e)\n(violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation\nprogram) applies as well.\nI have also considered the potential applicability of the mitigating conditions listed\nunder AG \u00b6 32. Applicant testified that his arrests in 2001 were largely due to immaturity\nand having little direction when he left the Marine Corps. However, he has not explained\nhis continued criminal conduct after he joined the Army and through at least 2002, when\nhe was 24 years old. He also insists that, because he now has children and better\nunderstands his responsibilities, he has changed and will not engage in criminal conduct\nin the future. However, most of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct arose from his use of\nalcohol, after his older two children were born. As discussed under Guideline G, below,\nhe still drinks, at times to excess. Thus, it is likely that he will put himself at risk of future\nadverse conduct similar to that alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, the record does not\nsupport application of any of the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 32. I specifically\nconclude that the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) or AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement) do not apply and that the Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns about his criminal conduct.\n\n8\nAlcohol Consumption\nAvailable information is sufficient to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.c.\nSpecifically, Applicant has abused alcohol since he was 17 years old. He was arrested\nnumerous times in the past 10 years for drunk driving, and he lost his job in November\n2007 as a direct result of excess drinking. Recent periods of abstinence are more\naccurately attributable to his work-related deployments to areas where alcohol is not\npresent by order of the military commands he supports. His testimony supports a\nconclusion that he still drinks to excess at times and that he has no insight, despite\nrepeated court-ordered referrals to alcohol awareness and counseling classes, into the\ndifficulties continued excess drinking has caused and will likely continue to cause. All of\nthe information presented, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, raises a security concern\nthat is expressed at AG \u00b6 21 as follows:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAvailable information specifically requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions at AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving\nwhile under  the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent); AG \u00b6 22(b) (alcohol-related incidents at work, such as\nreporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent); and AG \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent).\nHaving reviewed the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 23, I conclude that none\napply. Applicant testified that he would continue to drink when it is not prohibited and\nacknowledged that he might drink as many as 12 beers in a day. He has not, despite\nbeing told by one counselor in an ASAP class that he has a drinking problem, indicated\nany intent to modify his drinking, abstain from drinking of his own volition, or seek any\nform of clinical assistance to address his use of alcohol. Thus, the mitigating conditions\nat AG \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and AG \u00b6\n23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse,\nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a\npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser))\ndo not apply.\nFurther, Applicant is not now in counseling or treatment, nor has he completed\nany treatment for his drinking or established that he is changing his circumstances to\nsupport a more sober lifestyle. Accordingly, the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 23(c) (the\nindividual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment\nprogram, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory\n\n I found Applicant\u2019s testimony on this point and other issues difficult to believe.\n10\n9\nprogress) and AG \u00b6 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or\noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program) do not apply. Applicant has not\npresented sufficient information to refute, mitigate or extenuate the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns about his alcohol consumption.\nPersonal Conduct \nThe government\u2019s information is also sufficient to support the allegations in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c that he deliberately falsified his answers to several questions in his\nJanuary 2008 e-QIP. Although Applicant admitted these allegations in response to the\nSOR, it was clear in an accompanying letter and through his testimony that he denied\nany intent to falsify his answers or to mislead the government. If Applicant\u2019s position is\ninterpreted as denying the SOR allegations, the government would have the burden of\n\u201cpresenting witnesses and other information to establish facts that have been\ncontroverted.\u201d (Directive, E3.1.14) \nThe e-QIP (Gx. 1) shows he only listed one of his arrests, did not disclose he had\nbeen fired in November 2007, did not disclose any other arrests or charges as required,\nor that he had been ordered to counseling after his alcohol-related arrests. However,\nthere is no information that directly shows he intentionally provided false answers as\nalleged. Nonetheless, the totality of available information supports a conclusion that he\nintended to limit the amount of adverse information he disclosed to the government. He\nhas held a clearance for at least 10 years, and he had submitted at least two similar\napplications for clearance before January 2008. He knew or should have known what\ninformation had to be disclosed. As for his failure to disclose his firing, that event\noccurred less than three months before he submitted his e-QIP. Combined with his\nequivocal testimony  about why he was fired, his claim he did not intentionally withhold\n10\nthis information is untenable. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s experience in the clearance\napplication process undermines his claims he did not understand any of the questions\nput to him. Even had there been a seven-year limit on question 23.c, he had no reason\nnot to disclose his arrest in 2006. \nAll of the information presented, including Applicant\u2019s testimony, raises a security\nconcern that is expressed at AG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n The mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\n11\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) and AG \u00b6 17(f) (association with persons involved in\ncriminal activities has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations) are inapposite here.\n10\nAvailable information about his answers to his e-QIP specifically requires consideration\nof the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities). Additionally, because Applicant\nrepeatedly drove on a suspended license after convictions for drunk driving, and\nbecause he twice failed to appear to answer criminal charges, the record requires\napplication of AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information). \nOf the relevant mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 17, none apply. Applicant\nmade no effort to correct his e-QIP omissions. To the contrary, he compounded the\nconcerns about his honesty through his evasive and conflicting testimony about his\nanswers. Nor did he establish that he received bad advice that caused him to answer\nthe questions as he did. Thus, the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(b) (the refusal or failure to\ncooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or\ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon\nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s false statements in his e-QIP were made recently and constitute a\nsignificant offense in terms of the government\u2019s ability to manage its personnel security\nprogram. As to his alcohol-related misconduct and his willingness to disregard the terms\nof his various sentences for drunk driving, Applicant has not established that he is\ncorrecting these matters, and he has not presented sufficient information to show that\nhe is trying to resolve his drinking, the common denominator throughout his record of\nadverse conduct since January 2000. Accordingly, the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\n17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\nand AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) do not apply.  He has not refuted,\n11\nmitigated, or extenuated the government\u2019s information about his personal conduct. \n\n See footnote 7, supra.\n12\n See footnote 9, supra. \n13\n11\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E, G, and J. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 31\nyears old and presumed to be a mature adult. He served his country honorably in the\nMarines and the Army, and his recent job performance has been commendable.\nApplicant\u2019s co-workers, military customers, and supervisors feel he has the requisite\nintegrity, trustworthiness and reliability for continued access to classified information.\nHowever, it is not apparent that those observers are aware of any of the adverse\ninformation in Applicant\u2019s current background investigation. Applicant has himself\nundermined the value of the positive information in the record through his inconsistent\nresponses to the SOR and at his hearing regarding the allegations that he deliberately\nfalsified his e-QIP. Finally, he has not accepted responsibility for or acknowledged the\nseriousness of his drinking and the consequences thereof. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s past conduct and\n12\ncurrent circumstances shows he has failed to address satisfactorily the government\u2019s\ndoubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests as his own.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the government.  \n13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance\nis denied.\n                                         \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn December 2, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 17, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 3, \n2009. The case was originally scheduled for March 3, 2009, but was continued. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on February 17, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \non March 10, 2009.

They were marked as AE F through H.1 Department Counsel \nhad no objections and they were admitted and the record was closed. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 31 years old. He served in the Army on active duty for six years and \nin the Army Reserves for two years. He deployed to Bosnia twice and to Honduras. He \nwas honorable discharge as an E-4. He has an associate\u2019s degree in network systems \ntechnology. He has worked for a federal contractor as a security technician since \nNovember 2005. Applicant has been married since 2005. His wife has a medical \ncondition that limits her ability to work. Applicant and his wife live with her parents and \npay them rent.2  \n \nApplicant admitted he was \u201cneglectful\u201d with his finances. He did not have the \nmoney to pay his bills. He has attempted to help his family by giving them money to pay \ntheir bills. Some of his delinquent debts he was aware of and others he did not know \nabout. He understands that he owes money to creditors, but he needs to pay his daily \nexpenses.3 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a judgment ($3,344) for a debt for a store credit card. \nHe believes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.t is the same debt because he had no other credit \ncards from the store. The debt became delinquent in approximately 2004. Applicant got \nthe credit card for his wife\u2019s parents. He is not sure what they purchased. He spoke to \nhis mother-in-law about the debt, but they are unable to pay it also. Applicant has not \npaid the debt and his in-laws have not paid it.4  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a state tax lien ($950). Applicant believes that his \nprevious employer was not withholding enough tax from his pay thereby causing the \n \n1 AE F consisted of awards, decorations and commendations Applicant received while on active \nduty, along with a copy of his honorable discharge papers.

He stated he did not know he owed the money and believed it was for his 2004 \ntaxes. He filed his taxes on time, but did not have the money to pay them. Applicant \nprovided a release of tax lien notice for 2005. It shows the amount paid as $949.89. The \ndocument is dated November 18, 2008.5 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a state tax lien ($1,048). Applicant believed that his \nemployer was not withholding enough tax from his pay. He believes his wages were \ngarnished to repay the debt. Applicant provided a release of tax line notice for 2003. It \nshows the amount paid as $1,084. The document is dated August 1, 2008.6 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a credit card debt ($7,638). He used the credit card to \nhelp his girlfriend, now wife, with purchases and paying her bills. He has had no contact \nwith the creditor in the past two years. He has not made any payments since 2003 and \nhas no payment plan to resolve the debt.7 \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6 1.e is for cell phone service ($1,177). Applicant believed the \noriginal debt was around $800 and he had the money to pay the debt, but gave it to his \nmother-in-law so she could pay her mortgage. He has not contacted the creditor to \nresolve the debt, but will try to pay it off.8  \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.q are \nall medical debts. They total approximately $1,833. All are in collection and are for \nservices provided to both Applicant and his wife. He believes some of the debts are \ncopayments or for appointments that were missed. He stated he did not know he owed \nthem at the time. He tried to talk to the creditors. Some of the debts were for emergency \nroom visits, others he does not know what they were for. He has not paid or resolved \nany of these debts.9  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.r ($8,182) is for a vehicle that Applicant co-signed for his in-\nlaws. They defaulted on the loan in 2006 and it is in collection. The vehicle has not been \nrepossessed, but rather his mother-in-law has been trying to contact the creditor to \nreturn the vehicle. They do not drive the vehicle. The debt is unresolved.10 \n \n \n5 Tr. 42-44; AE G. \n \n6 Tr. 44-47; AE H. \n \n7 Tr. 53-55. \n \n8 Tr. 55-58. \n \n9 Tr. 58-64. \n \n10 Tr. 64-67. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.s ($175) is for cable television. Applicant disputes this debt. \nHe believes he paid the bill, but has not contacted the creditor to dispute the debt. He \ndid not provide documentation to show he paid it.11 \n \nApplicant owes approximately $20,000 in student loans that are deferred. The \ndeferment will expire in May 2009 and Applicant will be responsible for making \npayments. He estimated the monthly bill will be approximately $150.12  \n \nApplicant has not paid his delinquent debts because he does not have the \nmoney. He is afraid to contact the creditors because he can not pay them. Applicant \nadmitted he made mistakes with his finances. He has not had financial counseling. 13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified and stated he has attempted to pay his delinquent debts \nbut the creditors wanted too much money. She acknowledged that three of the debts \nwere incurred by her parents and they have not repaid Applicant. She believes \nApplicant would never jeopardize his country. He is honest and does not get in trouble. \nShe hopes to get a job soon to help with the family finances.14 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law testified that Applicant is an outstanding person, who is \ndedicated to his job and always does the right thing. He has experienced some bumps \nin life and tries to make the right decision, but made some mistakes. Applicant has tried \nto help him out financially and he admitted he has not repaid Applicant. Applicant and \nhis wife pay rent to live with their in-laws and they help out with some of the other \nexpenses as needed.15  \n \nApplicant also provided character letters from supervisors and coworkers. They \nconsider Applicant to be honest, reliable, trustworthy, efficient, competent and \ncourteous. He is a dedicated employee with a positive attitude.16 \n \nApplicant does not have a budget. It appears his expenses exceed his income. \nHis wife is looking for a job to help with the finances.17 Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \napproximately $22,438. \n \n \n \n11 Tr. 67-68. \n \n12 Tr. 75-77. \n \n13 Tr. 82. \n \n14 Tr.84-94. \n \n15 Tr. 96-100. \n \n16 AE A. \n \n17 Tr. 29-40, 77-78. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, The applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and the applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19, and especially considered \nthe following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has many debts, some that have been delinquent for more than five \nyears. He is afraid to contact the creditors because he does not have the money to pay \nthem. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid. He has not contacted many of his creditors or made nominal attempts to pay his \ncreditors. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nI find (a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant did not present evidence that his financial problems were the result of \nconditions beyond his control. He has given money to his in-laws for their bills and co-\nsigned on a vehicle that they then defaulted on. These actions were to the detriment of \nhis financial responsibilities and within his control. His in-laws have not repaid him. I find \nmitigating condition (b) does not apply. Applicant has not received financial counseling \nand has not provided evidence of a good-faith effort to pay his creditors. He did satisfy \nhis tax debts, but they were delinquent for years before they were satisfied. He has not \nprovided evidence that the problem is being resolved or under control. I find mitigating \nconditions (c) and (d) do not apply. \n \n \nApplicant disputed he owed certain debts. However he has not contacted the \ncreditors recently to resolve his disputes and failed to provide any documentation to \nsupport his disputes. Therefore, I find (e) does not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man who has \nserved his country honorably. He takes care of his wife and helps her family. Applicant \nhas many delinquent debts with no plan or workable budget for resolving them. He may \nhave legitimate disputes, but has not provided any evidence to substantiate his claims \nor taken any steps to dispute them. He has not contacted his creditors to resolve his \ndelinquent debts, concerned that they will not be willing to work out plans with him. Nor \nhas he been able to convince his in-laws to provide assistance in paying the debts that \nwere incurred for their benefit. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.t: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly within the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On February 9, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing. Applicant did not date the answer.  He \nsubmitted his answer from his assignment in a foreign country.  Applicant requested his \ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\nAugust 26, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nOn May 26, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case.  \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant. \nHe was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on July 1, 2009.  Applicant filed a \nResponse to the FORM on July 1, 2009, within the 30 day time allowed that would have \nexpired on July 31, 2009. I received the case assignment on July 21, 2009.  Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his undated Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \n&& 1.a to 1.e. He denies the factual allegations in \u00b6 \u00b6 1.f to 1.o of the SOR, with \nexplanations.   \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, divorced in 1993, has two children, and works for a \ndefense contractor. He has worked for the same employer since March 2008. He earns \nmore than $200,000 annually, with a gross monthly income of $16,324, and a net \nmonthly income of $6,669. Applicant is working in a foreign country until January 2010. \n(Items 4, 7) \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2001. He was discharged in \nbankruptcy in September 2001. Subsequent to the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant \nincurred other delinquent debt. (Items 4 to 7) \n \nApplicant has 14 delinquent debts totaling $58,376. He admits $18,599 and \ndenies $39,787 of the debts. (Items 4 to 7) \n \n1. and 2. Applicant owes two education loans for college courses he took in 2005 \nand 2006 (SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c). The loans total $13,438. As of March \n2009, Applicant owed $11,171.97 after making $5,000 in payments at the rate of $1,000 \nmonthly. Applicant in his Response to the FORM states his payments are current and \nthe loans are in rehabilitation status. The balance owed is $8,299.80. The November \n2008 credit report lists these debts under \u201cclosed accounts.\u201d These debts are resolved \nby installment payments. (Items 3-7, Response) \n \n3. Applicant owes $5,161 on a credit card debt (SOR subparagraph 1.d). This \ndebt was resolved with a settlement amount. The debt was owed on an automobile loan \nfor which Applicant did not make all his payments. The car was repossessed. The \naccount was charged off by the creditor after the settlement was made. According to the \ncredit report of November 2008 submitted by Applicant, the account is resolved. (Items \n3-7) \n \n4. Applicant owes unpaid child support payments in the amount of $34,249 (SOR \nsubparagraph 1.e).  Applicant had his arrearage payments increased in March 2008 to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\n$2,700 monthly to reduce the amount owed for the past child support. In the 16 months \nsince that arrangement started, Applicant would have paid $43,200, more than enough \nmoney to resolve that debt. The November 2008 credit report shows a zero balance \nowing on his child support. The November 2008 credit report lists these debts under \n\u201cclosed accounts.\u201d  The debt is resolved. (Items 3 to 7, Response) \n \n5. Applicant owed $1,907 to a collector (SOR subparagraph 1.f). It has been \ntransferred to another collector. Applicant intends to make two payments. He submitted \na document dated March 2009 that shows the debt was paid. The account numbers on \nthe document and in the April 2008 credit reports for this account are the same. The \ndebt is resolved by a settlement on March 2, 2009. (Items 3 to 7) \n \n6. Applicant paid the dental bill listed in the SOR at subparagraph 1.g for $50.  It \nwas paid on March 27, 2009. The creditor letter states the debt was paid in full. (Items 3 \nto 7) \n \n7. Applicant owes $386 on a credit card (SOR subparagraph 1.h). He paid this \ndebt in two installments. The first payment was $231.43 paid on August 20, 2008, plus a \n$5.00 charge for payment by telephone. The second payment was made on November \n4, 2008, in the amount of $155.76, plus a $5.00 telephone service charge. Applicant \nsubmitted extracts from his checking account statement verifying the payments. This \ndebt is resolved by payment. (Items 3-7) \n \n8. Applicant owes $776 on a cellular telephone debt (SOR subparagraph 1.i).  \nThis debt has been owed since February 2002, which is the oldest delinquent debt \nshown on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. Applicant claims in all the documents he submitted \nthat the debt was paid, but he does not have proof of payment. This debt does not \nappear on Applicant\u2019s November 2008 credit report, but did appear on his April and \nSeptember 2008 credit reports. The status of the debt is unclear, but may have been \nresolved by payment because it does not appear on the latest credit report available. \n(Items 3-7) \n \n9. Applicant owes $139 on a satellite television account (SOR subparagraph 1.j).  \nThis account has been owed since May 2003. This debt appears on the April 2008 \ncredit report, but not the September and November 2008 credit report. Applicant denies \nowing this money to this creditor. The debt is unresolved because of its unknown status. \n(Items 3-7) \n \n 10. Applicant owes $964 to a collector on a bank credit card (SOR subparagraph \n1.k). The debt arose originally from a prepaid credit card Applicant obtained after his \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. This debt was paid in the amount of $736.70 on July 9, 2008.  \nApplicant submitted a letter from the collector verifying the payment. This debt was \nresolved by payment. (Items 3 to 7) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\n11. Applicant owes a storage company $58 for fees (SOR subparagraph 1.l).  \nThe debt appears on the April 2008 credit report, and not on the two subsequent credit \nreports. Applicant claims his former wife incurred the storage charges, and he is not \nobligated to pay the charges. His Answer contends the creditor has no record of his \ndebt. The debt remains unresolved because of the absence of any proof of payment or \nnon-obligation by Applicant. (Items 3 to 7)  \n \n12. Applicant owes $775 to a collector (SOR subparagraph 1.m). This account \nappears on the April 2008 credit report, but not on the two subsequent reports \ncontained in the FORM. Applicant denies responsibility for the debt, which originated in \n2007. He claims the original creditor was \u201celusive,\u201d and they could not confirm any \ninformation on their system about him. The debt remains unresolved because of \nApplicant\u2019s lack of information about it.  Applicant has not submitted any documents \nshowing he disputed the debt in writing. (Items 3 to 7) \n \n13. Applicant owes an insurance company $148 (SOR subparagraph 1.n).  \nApplicant claims to have contacted the company, and it has no record of any debt.  He \nstated he has insurance with the company at the present time. This debt appears on the \nApril 2008 credit report, but not the two subsequent reports. Applicant had no copies of \ncorrespondence with this creditor to show he contacted them, or that he asked them to \nremove the debt from his credit reports. He did not submit correspondence showing he \nasked the three credit agencies to remove this debt, or that he filed a dispute with the \nagencies. This debt remains unresolved. (Items 3 to 7) \n \n14. The final delinquent debt listed in the SOR at subparagraph 1.o is $335 owed \nto another cellular telephone company. This debt was paid in full on July 2, 2008.  \nApplicant submitted a letter from the collector verifying the debt was paid. This debt is \nresolved by payment. (Items 3 to 7) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the Awhole person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\nThe guideline at AG & 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns.  From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the \nfacts found in this case: \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially \ndisqualifying; and,   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated $58,376 in delinquent debt from 2002 to the present time \nthat remains unpaid.  Applicant had 14 delinquent debts, including past child support \nand an unpaid debt on a repossessed car.  \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nOf these six conditions, only one is applicable. AG \u00b6 20 (d) provides that if a \nperson starts a good-faith effort to repay or resolve in some manner his delinquent \ndebts, then the security concern can be mitigated. Applicant, even though he is living \nand working overseas, took the initiative to investigate and repay nine of his delinquent \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\ndebts.  He is able to make payments, including $2,700 monthly for the purposes of \npaying past due child support, because he is now receiving a large salary for his work.   \n \n \nThere are only five debts which may be unresolved from the original 14 debts.  \nApplicant claims they are paid, or they do not appear on the records of the creditors \nlisted in the three credit reports in the file. Those debts are set forth in SOR \nsubparagraphs 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n.  The amount owed on these debts is $1,896.  \nThis amount is miniscule, and could be resolved definitively by Applicant with further \ndiligent work when he returns from his foreign assignment.  Some of these debts do not \nappear on the latest credit report, such as the $776 contained in SOR subparagraph 1.i.  \nIf the debt is paid, then Applicant only owes $1,120 on the remaining four debts. If what \nthe creditors told him is true, then he would not owe any of these five debts.  If the debts \ncontinue to appear on his credit reports, he could dispute them with the credit reporting \nagencies and possibly have them removed from his credit reports. Or, Applicant could \npay the debts in one month from his salary, thereby removing them from his credit \nrecord.  His problem may be that if the creditors truly have no record of any debt, he \nmight not be able to get them to accept the payments. Nonetheless, Applicant has \nresolved the larger debts.  It is likely he will resolve these five minor debts even before \nhe returns to the United States. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recentcy of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an adult when he \nincurred the debts. As an adult, he has worked diligently and consistently to repay or \nresolve in some way his delinquent debts. The oldest debt started in 2002, and that debt \nmay have been paid. He changed his behavior and resolved these debts. There is no \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\npotential for coercion because the debts remaining unresolved amount to less than \n$2,000. With his large salary, there is no likelihood of recurrence of his previous \nspending pattern. Applicant now has a steady and well-paying job, and can pay his \ndebts as he incurs them. Applicant accepted responsibility for his debts and paid them. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or substantial doubts \nas to Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.o:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact. For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms 1 the Judge\u2019s decision. Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) only contained documentary evidence establishing that she had settled one of the 18 debts listed in the SOR.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 26, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in finding that she had not pursued charges against her ex-husband for\n1\nopening accounts without her knowledge, that she had not sought credit counseling, and that she had not paid off five\nof 18 debts listed in the SOR.  To the extent that the Judge relied on his finding that Applicant had not pursued criminal\ncharges against the ex-husband, such reliance was misplaced because the Directive has no such requirement.\nThe Board has previously noted that it is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation\n2\nabout the satisfaction of individual debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008).\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On April 30, 2009, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\nerred with respect to several of his findings of fact.   For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms\n1\nthe Judge\u2019s decision.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) only contained\ndocumentary evidence establishing that she had settled one of the 18 debts listed in the SOR.  There\nwas no other independent evidence to corroborate assertions she had made in her answer to the\nSOR.   On appeal she submits four documents which indicate that she has met with a credit\n2\ncounselor and has paid off three of her 18 debts.  Two of these documents are dated after the close\nof the record.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence on appeal. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n\n3\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\noutstanding debts and was still trying to resolve her financial problems.  In light of the foregoing,\nthe Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the limited mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to two of\nthe SOR factual allegations, but he reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de\nnovo. The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n4, 2007).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 26 January 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F.  Applicant answered the SOR 5 February 2000, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 22 April 2009. The record in this case\nclosed 16 April 2009, the day Department Counsel entered no objection to Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nApril 30, 2009\n\nApplicant\u2019s answer documented that the September 2006 judgment alleged in 1.s. was satisfied in August\n2\n2007, before the SOR was issued. Her answer also confirms that the two accounts at 1.e. and 1.f. were\ncurrent as of February 2009. The government\u2019s evidence confirms that the debts at 1.c. and 1.j. are the same\naccount. Record evidence does not support Applicant\u2019s claim that the debts at 1.a. and 1.g. are the same\naccount. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM documented that she settled and paid the debt at 1.n. in April\n2009, at a 90% discount.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations of 1.a., 1.g. 1.h., 1.k., 1.m., 1.n.,\n1.p., 1.q., and 1.r.. She denied the remaining SOR allegations.  She is a 29-year-old,\n2\nelectronics technician employed by a U.S. defense contractor since July 2007. She has\nnot previously held an industrial clearance, but had a clearance while she was in the\nmilitary from 1998 to 2006.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 19 delinquent debts\ntotaling over $25,000. The debts alleged are all listed as individual obligations of\nApplicant on the credit reports contained in the record. Applicant unequivocally admits\nfour debts totaling over $10,000, that she has taken no steps to address despite a\npersonal financial statement that indicates that she and her current husband have the\nmeans to do so. She asserts, without corroboration, that four debts (1.k., 1.m., 1.p., and\n1.q.) were opened by her ex-husband either after their divorce or while they were in the\nprocess of getting a divorce. She claims he opened these accounts in her name using a\npower-of-attorney she had given him to enable him to act on her behalf when she was\non military deployment. Aside from her failure to corroborate these claims, at least one\nof the accounts\u2014a mail-order lingerie account at 1.q.\u2014was opened in October 1999\nwhile she was still single and fell delinquent in May 2001, shortly after her marriage.\nShe has not explained why she has not pursued criminal charges against her ex-\nhusband.\nApplicant married her first husband in March 2001, and they divorced in August\n2002. She remarried in May 2006. Beyond the fact of her August 2002 divorce, and her\nclaims that her ex-husband opened four accounts without her knowledge, she has\nprovided no explanation for why her accounts fell delinquent, or why she has failed to\naddress any of them (except for the account she settled after the SOR was issued). The\ndelinquent accounts range from accounts she opened in 1999 to a January 2007\njudgment for over $6,000 (now grown with interest to nearly $7,500. The February 2009\ncredit report she submitted with her answer reflects a new delinquent debt arising in\nAugust 2008.\nApplicant disputed two accounts (1.c./j. and 1.d.) on the ground that she had\nother accounts with the same creditors that were current. However, the account\nnumbers she provided do not match the account numbers for the delinquent accounts.\nSeveral of the alleged debts have aged off her credit reports. She disputes several\naccounts because she does not know who the original creditor is. Nevertheless, her\nAugust 2008 clearance application disclosed that she had \u201cquite a few\u201d adverse credit\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n4\n3\nitems on her credit report. Although she provided no specifics, she appears to have\nbeen aware of more delinquent accounts than she currently acknowledges responsibility\nfor.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties, which are ongoing.  Even if I limited my analysis to the four\n4\naccounts she acknowledges without reservation, I could not mitigate the security\nconcerns, for she had taken no steps to address these debts and given no cogent\nreason for failing to do so. Further, she has failed to corroborate any of her claims that\nmight mitigate the remaining debts.\n\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n5\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n4\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  She has not established how the\n5\ndebts were due to circumstances beyond her control, and she has not acted responsibly\nin addressing her debts.  She does not claim to have undertaken any credit counseling,\n6\nand she has not otherwise brought the problem under control.  Only one of her debts\n7\nhas been paid in a timely, good-faith effort.  Further, given that she has not sought or\n8\nused effective financial counseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that\nApplicant will resolve her financial problems in the foreseeable future.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel who possesses valid\npassports from both countries. For about 31 of the past 33 years, he has held a security\nclearance without adverse incident. He is not likely to succumb to foreign influence that\nmay arise because of his close ties to his sister and her family in Israel. But foreign\npreference concerns are not fully mitigated because he has taken no steps to relinquish\nhis foreign passport. He did not disclose on his security clearance application that he\nheld a valid foreign passport, but personal conduct concerns are not established since\nhis error was inadvertent. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on February 15, 2008. On March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C, Guideline B, and Guideline E that provided the\nDecember 7, 2009\n\n2\nbasis for its preliminary decision to revoke his security clearance and to refer the matter\nto an administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2009, and requested a hearing before\nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 26, 2009, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On August 4, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for August 18, 2009.\nApplicant had been consulted about his availability and was willing to waive the\nDirective\u2019s 15-day notice requirement.\nAt the hearing, three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and four Applicant exhibits\n(Ex. A-D) were admitted in evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\nreceived on August 27, 2009. I also agreed to take administrative notice of certain facts\npertinent to Israel and its foreign relations, including with the U.S., infra.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn June 25, 2009, the government requested administrative notice be taken of\ncertain facts relating to Israel and its foreign relations, including with the United States.\nThe request was based on publications from the U.S. State Department, the\nCongressional Research Service, the National Counterintelligence Center, the Office of\nthe National Counterintelligence Executive, the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, and\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. The government\u2019s\nformal request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were\nincluded in the record. Applicant was given an opportunity to respond at his hearing,\nand he did not object to my taking administrative notice. Those facts accepted for\nadministrative notice are set forth in the Findings of Fact, infra.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant\nexercised dual citizenship with Israel and the United States (SOR 1.a); that he applied\nfor, and was issued on September 18, 2006, an Israeli passport despite his U.S.\nnaturalization in 1978 (SOR 1.d); that he possessed a valid Israeli passport as of\nOctober 27, 2008 (SOR 1.b); and that he had used it in lieu of his U.S. passport when\nexiting Israel in September 2006 (SOR 1.c). DOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign\ninfluence, that Applicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel who\nresides in Israel (SOR 2.a), and that Applicant travels to Israel about once every three\nyears (SOR 2.b). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have\n\nDOHA alleged that Applicant falsified an e-QIP dated February 12, 2008. W hile the form bears a\n1\ncertification date of February 12, 2008, Applicant did not sign the form until February 15, 2008.\n3\ndeliberately falsified his February 2008 e-QIP by denying that he held an active foreign\npassport in the last 7 years (SOR 3.a).1\nApplicant responded, \u201cI admit\u201d to each allegation in the SOR. However,\nconcerning the alleged falsification of his e-QIP, he explained that he was ill and in a\nrush to finish the e-QIP. Consequently, he \u201cput in an \u2018x\u2019 in the wrong box,\u201d and failed to\ndetect the error. He added that he immediately presented his foreign passport during his\nsubject interview with a government investigator. After considering the pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 68-year-old endowed professor in engineering at a U.S. public\nuniversity, and he has held this position since September 1976. Excepting a two-year\nperiod in the 1980s when his clearance was administratively withdrawn because he had\nno need for access to classified information, Applicant has held a security clearance\nsince October 1976 (Ex. 1, Tr. 33). His clearance is required for defense-related\nresearch and for his participation on expert panels for the U.S. government (Exs. A, B,\nC, D, Tr. 33-34, 38), and is being sponsored by an academic  research institute (Tr. 35).\nApplicant was born in Romania in 1941 to a Czech mother and Hungarian father.\nHe was raised in Romania with his sister, who was born in 1945 (Ex. 1). In 1960, the\nfamily immigrated to Israel (Exs. 1, 3, Tr. 36, 42). Both Applicant and his sister acquired\nIsraeli citizenship. At the time, they renounced their Romanian citizenship as required\nby Israeli law (Ex. 3). There is no indication that their parents became Israeli citizens.\nApplicant studied electrical engineering in Israel, and he served as a\nnoncommissioned officer in the Israeli Army from November 1963 to May 1966 (Ex. 1,\nTr. 36). In October 1966, he married his first wife, who had emigrated from Romania to\nIsrael. In 1967, they came to the United States for Applicant to pursue his graduate\nstudies, and he earned his doctorate degree in February 1970 (Ex. 1, Tr. 36-37). Their\ntwo children, who are now in their thirties, were born in the United States (Ex. 1). He\nand his first wife divorced in 1983, and in May 1984, Applicant married a native of\nRussia who had been a naturalized U.S. citizen for almost ten years (Ex. 1). Applicant\nhas a son, who was born in Romania in 1990, but is a U.S. citizen (Ex. 1).\nIn April 1970, Applicant began employment as a senior engineer for a defense\ncontractor in the United States (Ex. 1). In August 1976, Applicant left the job for an\nacademic position at the university where he is now a distinguished professor in the\nelectrical and computer engineering department (Ex. 1, Answer). In October 1976,\nApplicant was granted a secret-level security clearance. Since the summer of 1977, he\nhas received a series of research grants and contracts from the U.S. military (Tr. 38).\nIn January 1978, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen (Ex. 1). A dual\ncitizen of Israel and the United States since January 1978 (Ex. 1), Applicant held U.S.\n\nApplicant testified that he just happened to have both his U.S. and Israeli passports in a drawer in\n2\nhis office (Tr. 31).\n4\nand Israeli passports (Tr. 39). He used his Israeli passport on trips to Israel (Tr. 39).\nBoth passports were stolen while he was in France in 1985. He renewed only his U.S.\npassport (Tr. 31, 39). Applicant subsequently traveled to Israel five or six times solely on\nhis U.S. passport without incident until mid-September 2006. On that trip, which was to\nlecture at two Israeli universities (Tr. 54), Israeli border officials checked computer\nrecords, which revealed that Applicant had been issued an Israeli passport in the early\n1980s. Applicant was allowed to enter Israel on his U.S. passport, which had been\nrenewed in July 2005 for another ten years (Exs. 1, 2, Tr. 40), but he was told that he\nwould need an Israeli passport to exit the country (Tr. 31-32). Three days later,\nApplicant was issued an Israeli passport valid for ten years. He presented the Israeli\npassport on his exit from Israel later that same day (Ex. 2, Tr. 50). Applicant did not use\nhis Israeli passport on foreign travel outside of trips to Israel, including to Europe in the\nsummer of 2008 (Ex. 2, Tr. 32).\nTo update his security clearance, Applicant completed an e-QIP on February 15,\n2008. He disclosed his dual citizenship with Israel and the United States, but he\nchecked off \u201cNo\u201d to question 17.d concerning whether he had an active passport issued\nby a foreign government in the last 7 years (Ex. 1). In the process of filing out the form\non the computer, Applicant inadvertently marked the wrong box. He did not realize his\nerror at the time (Tr. 30-31). Applicant indicated on the e-QIP that his spouse was a\ndual citizen of Russia and the United States, but that his children were all U.S. citizens.\nApplicant also disclosed his sister\u2019s Israeli residency and citizenship. He listed no\npleasure travel in the past seven years, but reported business trips to several countries,\nincluding Israel, between July 2000 and July 2007 (Ex. 1).\nOn May 5, 2008, Applicant was interviewed about his dual citizenship by an\nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management. The interview was\nconducted in Applicant\u2019s office at the university (Ex. 3, Tr. 31). Applicant indicated that\nhe acquired Israeli citizenship when he emigrated from Romania to Israel with his family\non an unrecalled date (Ex. 3). Applicant responded affirmatively when asked whether he\npossessed a foreign passport, and he handed his Israeli passport to the investigator for\nperusal (Tr. 30).  Applicant explained that when he traveled to Israel in September\n2\n2006, the Israeli government required him to obtain an Israeli passport to leave the\ncountry. He denied any subsequent use of the foreign passport, but admitted that the\npassport had not been invalidated. Applicant denied any allegiance to Israel and\nexpressed his willingness to renounce his Israeli citizenship and relinquish his Israeli\npassport if necessary for his clearance. He explained that he had not wanted to go\nthrough the lengthy and complicated process required to renounce his Israeli citizenship\n(Ex. 3, Tr. 32). He asserted that he would not have acquired an Israeli passport if he\nhad not been forced to do so by the Israeli government. Concerning foreign contacts,\nApplicant revealed that he had ongoing contact with his sister and her husband once to\ntwice yearly in-person when they visit him in the United States or when he travels to\nIsrael, and monthly by telephone or email. His sister was employed as a neuro-\n\n5\npsychologist in Israel. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law worked for a U.S. company and he\ntraveled on business monthly to the United States (Ex. 3). The interviewer declined to\nmake any recommendation to Applicant concerning the surrender of his foreign\npassport, and Applicant took no action following the interview to renounce his foreign\ncitizenship or relinquish his foreign passport (Tr. 32). Because he had an Israeli\npassport when he was initially granted his security clearance in 1976, he assumed there\nwas no problem with retaining a foreign passport and he was not expressly told\notherwise (Tr. 58). \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a copy of his current\nU.S. and Israeli passports on October 27, 2008. His Israeli passport bore only one\nborder control stamp, which showed his departure from Israel on September 18, 2006\n(Ex. 2). In December 2008, Applicant went to Israel for his niece\u2019s wedding. At the\ninvitation of faculty, he again lectured at the same two Israeli universities as he had in\n2006, although this time to different departments (Tr. 55). Applicant entered Israel\nthrough passport control for Israeli citizens, but he presented both his U.S. and Israeli\npassports (Tr. 40, 51). Israeli officials were interested only in his Israeli passport (Tr.\n51). When he departed Israel, Applicant presented just his Israeli passport (Tr. 40, 52).\nOn receipt of the SOR on March 24, 2009, Applicant was on notice that his\nexercise of dual citizenship and his possession of a valid Israeli passport were of\nconcern to the Department of Defense. As of his hearing on August 18, 2009, Applicant\nwas a dual citizen of Israel and the United States and possessed valid passports from\nboth countries (Tr. 32), although he reiterated his willingness to relinquish his Israeli\npassport and citizenship if required by the U.S. government to retain his security\nclearance (Tr. 40).\nApplicant understands that on revocation of his Israeli citizenship, he would be\nissued documents by the Israeli government that would permit him to enter and exit\nIsrael on his U.S. passport (Tr. 41). Based on his experience in September 2006,\nApplicant believes that he could surrender his Israeli passport without relinquishing his\nIsraeli citizenship, but he would not be allowed to leave Israel as an Israeli citizen on his\nU.S. passport (Tr. 52-53). Applicant made no effort to confirm the accuracy of this belief\n(Tr. 53). Applicant wants to be able to travel to Israel for family events in the future, such\nas the wedding of his other niece (Tr. 41). He has not tried to obtain official approval\nfrom the U.S. government for his retention of his Israeli passport (Tr. 57) because he\nwas unaware that he should or could obtain such approval (Tr. 57-58).\nApplicant\u2019s sister works as a neuro-psychologist treating brain-damaged patients\nat a hospital in Israel. She studied for her master\u2019s degree in the United States from\n1977 or 1978 to about 1983, when she returned to Israel to care for Applicant\u2019s and her\nmother. Following their mother\u2019s death in 1990, Applicant\u2019s sister returned to the United\nStates with her spouse for his job with a U.S. company. Around 1995, his sister and her\nimmediate family moved back to Israel. As of August 2009, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law,\nwho is a computer scientist, was working in Israel for the same U.S. employer (Tr. 43-\n44). Applicant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law have two daughters. The older daughter, who\n\n6\nwas married in December 2008, is a software engineer currently working in Europe. The\nyounger daughter is a post-doctorate fellow in biochemistry at a university in Israel (Tr.\n45). Applicant has a 95-year-old aunt who is a resident citizen of Israel (Tr. 46).\nApplicant visited with his sister and his aunt on his trips to Israel (Ex. 3). As of August\n2009, Applicant had telephone contact with his sister every few months (Tr. 49). Twice\nyearly at most, Applicant also has contact with Israeli academics at various international\nconferences and through several professional societies in his field of expertise (Tr. 59).\nApplicant\u2019s lectures in Israel involved open source published material. Applicant is\nrequired to clear any publications and planned lectures with the U.S. government if the\nmaterial is defense-related and not completely open source (Tr. 55). No evidence was\npresented to show that he had failed to comply in any aspects with that requirement.\nRenewal of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is strongly endorsed by an academic\ncolleague at the university (Ex. A), and by a principal research engineer affiliated with\nthe research institute that is sponsoring Applicant\u2019s clearance (Ex. B). Both colleagues\nare  familiar with Applicant\u2019s personal character and technical expertise from more than\n20 years of respective relations. As one of the top, if not the top, researchers in the\nworld in a field that is vital to U.S. defense interests, Applicant brings considerable\nknowledge and talent to maintaining and strengthening the national defense. These\nprofessional colleagues attest to Applicant possessing \u201ca strong brand of patriotism\u201d\n(Ex. A) and \u201cunwavering allegiance to the United States\u201d (Ex. B).\n \nAfter reviewing the U.S. government publications concerning Israel and its\nforeign relations, including with the United States, I take administrative notice of the\nfollowing facts:\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy of about 7.1 million people. Israel generally\nrespects the human rights of its citizens, although there have been some issues\nrespecting treatment of Palestinian detainees and discrimination against Arab citizens.\nDespite the instability and armed conflict that have marked Israel\u2019s relations within the\nregion since it came into existence, Israel has developed a diversified, technologically\nadvanced market economy focused on high-technology electronic and biomedical\nequipment, chemicals, and transport equipment.\nThe United States and Israel have a close friendship based on common\ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. The United States was the\nfirst country to officially recognize Israel, only eleven minutes after Israel declared its\nindependence in 1948. In 1985, Israel and the United States concluded a Free Trade\nAgreement designed to strengthen economic ties by eliminating tariffs. The United\nStates is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner. As of 2007, 35% of Israel\u2019s exports went to the\nUnited States, while 13.9% of its imports came from the United States. Israel is a\nprominent recipient of U.S. aid. Since 1949, the United States has provided more than\n$30 billion in economic assistance to Israel. Between 1976 and 2003, Israel was the\nlargest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. The United States has also provided Israel with $9\nbillion in loan guarantees since 2003, which enable Israel to borrow money from\ncommercial lenders at a lower rate. The United States and Israel established in April\n\n7\n1988 a Joint Economic Development Group to develop the Israeli economy by\nexchanging views of Israel economic policy planning, stabilization efforts, and structural\nreform.\nIsrael and the United States do not have a mutual defense agreement, although\nthe United States remains committed to Israel\u2019s security and well-being. The United\nStates is the principal international proponent of the Arab-Israeli peace process, and\nhas been actively involved in negotiating an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In\n1989, Israel was one of the first countries designated a Major Non-NATO ally. As such,\nIsrael receives preferential treatment in bidding for U.S. defense contracts and access\nto expanded weapons systems at lower prices. Israel and the United States are\npartners in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d missile defense project, and have concluded numerous\ntreaties and agreements aimed at strengthening military ties, including agreements on\nmutual defense assistance, procurement, and security of information. Israel and the\nUnited States have established joint groups to further military cooperation. The two\ncountries participate in joint military exercises and collaborate on military research and\nweapons development. The United States has pledged to ensure that Israel maintains a\n\u201cqualitative military edge\u201d over its neighbors, and has been a major source of Israeli\nmilitary funding. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of March 11, 2009, provided $2.38\nbillion in foreign military financing for Israel. Strong congressional support for Israel has\nresulted in Israel receiving benefits not available to other countries. Israel is permitted to\nuse one-quarter of its foreign military assistance grant for procurement spending from\nIsraeli defense companies.\nArms agreements between Israel and the United States limit the use of U.S.\nmilitary equipment to defensive purposes. The United States has acted to restrict aid\nand/or rebuked Israel in the past for possible improper use of U.S.-supplied military\nequipment. The United States is concerned about Israeli settlements; Israel\u2019s sales of\nsensitive security equipment and technology, especially to China; Israel\u2019s inadequate\nprotection of U.S. intellectual property; Israel\u2019s suspected use of U.S.-made cluster\nbombs against civilian populated areas in Lebanon; and espionage-related cases\nimplicating Israeli officials. Israeli military officials have been implicated in economic\nespionage activity in the United States. U.S. government employees and U.S.\ngovernment contractors have been implicated in providing classified and sensitive\ninformation to Israel. Israel was listed as one of the nations that aggressively targeted\nU.S. economic intelligence as recently as 2000.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\n\n8\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion in obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the United States. AG \u00b6 9. Applicant immigrated to\nIsrael with his family in 1960, and he became an Israeli citizen. As required by Israeli\nlaw, he fulfilled his military duty by serving as a noncommissioned officer in the Israeli\nArmy from November 1963 to May 1966. His military service for Israel does not\nimplicate AG \u00b6 10(a)(2), \u201cmilitary service or willingness to bear arms for a foreign\n\nAG \u00b6 10(a) applies when the exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship occurs\n3\nafter one becomes a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\n9\ncountry,\u201d because he was not yet a U.S. citizen.  Possible concerns of foreign\n3\npreference raised by his past foreign military service are mitigated under AG \u00b6 11(c),\n\u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before\nthe individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor.\u201d Similarly,\nApplicant accepted educational benefits from Israel in his youth. See AG \u00b6 10(a)(3)\n(stating, \u201caccepting  educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such\nbenefits from a foreign country\u201d). AG \u00b6 10(a)(3) again does not apply in the absence of\nany evidence that he has accepted any social benefits or entitlements from Israel after\nhis U.S. naturalization in January 1978.\nHowever, Applicant exercised a privilege of his foreign citizenship after becoming\na U.S. citizen when he obtained an Israeli passport while in Israel in September 2006,\nand then used that foreign passport later that day to exit Israel, and to enter and exit\nIsrael on a subsequent trip in December 2008. Applicant acquired the foreign passport\nonly after he had been told that he would not be allowed to exit Israel without one, but\nthe possession and/or use of a current foreign passport raises security concerns of\nforeign preference, irrespective of whether it is necessitated by foreign law or\ndiscretionary. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport,\u201d clearly applies.\nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 11(a), \u201cdual citizenship is\nbased solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country,\u201d does not squarely\napply. He immigrated to Israel with his parents and sister when he was 18 or 19, and he\nand his sister became Israeli citizens. Available information does not show that his\nmother, who was a Czech citizen, or his father, who was a Hungarian citizen, acquired\nIsraeli citizenship.\nAG \u00b6 11(b), \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship,\u201d must be considered because Applicant told a government investigator in\nMay 2008, and reiterated at his hearing in August 2009, that he was willing to renounce\nhis Israeli citizenship and relinquish his foreign passport if necessary for his clearance.\nA willingness to renounce foreign citizenship is entitled to less weight if it is in any way\nconditional or unaccompanied by steps taken to achieve that end. Applicant explained in\nMay 2008 that he had not yet renounced his Israeli citizenship because he did not want\nto go through the long and complicated process required. The investigator declined to\nadvise Applicant about what he should do. Since Applicant had been granted access to\nclassified information before his U.S. naturalization, and he retained his access for 31 of\nthe last 33 years, he could reasonably assume that his Israeli citizenship was not an\nissue. Likewise, Applicant had held an Israeli passport until about 1985, and no one\ninformed him that there was a problem with his possession of a foreign passport.\n\n10\nBut on receipt of the SOR in March 2009, Applicant was on notice that his active\nexercise of dual citizenship by obtaining and using an Israeli passport in September\n2006 raised concerns of foreign preference. As of August 2009, Applicant had not\nsurrendered or otherwise invalidated his Israeli passport. Nor had he started the\nprocess of citizenship renunciation, despite learning that he would be permitted to travel\nto Israel on his U.S. passport if he renounced his Israeli citizenship. While Applicant is\nnot required to renounce his Israeli citizenship for access, the U.S. government does\nnot encourage its citizens to remain dual nationals because of the complications that\nmight ensue from obligations owed to the foreign country. During his trip to Israel in\nDecember 2008, Applicant entered the country in the line reserved for citizens of Israel.\nClearly, he could have entered through passport control for foreign visitors, although he\npresented both his U.S. and Israeli passports. Since the Israeli officials wanted only his\nIsraeli passport, Applicant did not bother to present both passports when he exited the\ncountry. His use of the foreign passport was not intended as an act of preference for\nIsrael, but rather to comply with Israeli legal requirements over which he had no control.\nNonetheless, Applicant has not fully mitigated the foreign preference concerns\nraised by his acquisition and use of the foreign passport. Applicant made no effort to\nseek approval for his use of the foreign passport before he traveled to Israel in\nDecember 2008, apparently because he did not realize that he could do so. Although\nhis acquisition and use of the foreign passport was motivated by necessity, absent prior\napproval by the cognizant security authority, AG \u00b6 11(d), \u201cuse of a foreign passport is\napproved by the cognizant security authority,\u201d does not apply. AG \u00b6 11(e), \u201cthe passport\nhas been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated,\u201d also does not apply in mitigation, since Applicant possesses an Israeli\npassport that is not scheduled to expire until 2016. Applicant is likely to travel to Israel in\nthe future, for family events, or to lecture at Israeli universities, or both.  As long as he\npossesses a valid Israeli passport, future use of that passport cannot be ruled out, given\nhis demonstrated compliance with Israeli requirements as recently as December 2008.\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6, as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\n\n11\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States who resides in\nIsrael. Applicant visits her when he is in Israel about once every three years, most\nrecently in September 2006, and again in December 2008 for her daughter\u2019s wedding.\nHe also has telephone contact with her every few months. These close family ties are\nunderstandable, but at the same time, they raise a heightened risk of undue foreign\ninfluence. AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion,\u201d applies.\nMoreover, AG \u00b6 7(i), \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which\nmay make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country,\u201d is implicated. Applicant may have had no\nchoice but to obtain an Israeli passport if he wanted to exit Israel in September 2006.\nHowever, by accepting invitations to lecture at Israeli universities during his trips (\u201cI also\ngave lectures in 2008. Whenever I go someplace, usually they invite me to give some\nlectures.\u201d Tr. 54), Applicant heightens his visibility within academia and increases the\nrisk of undue foreign influence through these professional contacts.\nApplicant\u2019s closest relations (spouse and children) enjoy the protections of U.S.\ncitizenship and residency. Yet, it is difficult to fully satisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a),\n\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it\nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Israel and the United States have a close friendship. The United States is\ncommitted to Israel\u2019s security, to the extent of ensuring that Israel maintains a\n\u201cqualitative military edge\u201d in the region. Israel receives preferential treatment in bidding\nfor U.S. defense contracts and substantial economic aid from the United States. Yet the\ninterests of even the closest of allies are not always completely aligned.\nThe United States is concerned about Israeli settlements, Israel\u2019s military sales to\nChina, Israel\u2019s inadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property, and espionage-\nrelated cases implicating Israeli officials and U.S. government employees or U.S.\ngovernment contractors. Israeli military officials have been implicated in economic\nespionage activity in the United States. Israel was listed as one of the nations that\naggressively targeted U.S. economic intelligence as recently as 2000. Nothing about\nApplicant\u2019s sister\u2019s work as a neuro-psychologist at a hospital or her spouse\u2019s work as a\nsoftware engineer for a U.S. company in Israel heightens the risk of undue foreign\ninfluence, but I cannot apply either AG \u00b6 8(a) or AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communications\nwith foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d to this family relationship.\nFurthermore, Applicant has not indicated that he intends to decline any future invitations\nto lecture in Israel. While there is no evidence that he has failed to clear publications or\nlecture material with appropriate U.S. authorities when necessary, ongoing contacts\nwith Israeli academics is likely.\n\n12\nAs for the potential applicability of AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d Applicant\u2019s loyalty or\nobligation to his sister and her family in Israel cannot be reasonably characterized as\nminimal. Applicant testified that he would not surrender his foreign passport if it meant\nhe would not be allowed to go to Israel for family events (\u201cI have another niece who\nmight get married. There will be a wedding. I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for me\nto say\u2013No, I cannot come.\u201d Tr. 41). On the other hand, Applicant has deep and\nlongstanding relationships in the United States, most notably his immediate family\nmembers, his academic position and professional standing in his chosen field of\nexpertise, his U.S. citizenship since 1978, and his continuous residency in the United\nStates for more than 40 years. Other than the acquisition and use of his Israeli passport,\nApplicant has not actively exercised his Israeli citizenship. Considering the many years\nover which he has held a security clearance without adverse incident, Applicant can be\nexpected to fulfill his security obligations to the United States in the event of any undue\nforeign pressure or influence.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is the failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nOn his February 2008 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed his dual citizenship with Israel\nand the United States. Yet, he checked off \u201cNo\u201d to question 17.d concerning whether he\nhad an active foreign passport issued in the last seven years. Applicant submits that he\ninadvertently erred, and did not realize his mistake until it was brought to his attention.\nCertainly, given Applicant\u2019s academic stature and previous experience with a clearance,\nhe can reasonably be expected to understand the importance of accuracy and full\ndisclosure, and he failed to exercise due care in filling out the form. But mistakes can\nalso be overlooked, especially when the document is prepared electronically. Applicant\ndisclosed his Israeli citizenship, his travel to Israel for business, and his past military\nservice in the Israeli Army. The evidence falls short of proving that he deliberately\nconcealed his possession of a valid Israeli passport. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d does not apply when\nomissions are inadvertent.\n\n13\nFurthermore, before he realized his error, Applicant presented his Israeli\npassport to the investigator in May 2008 in response to whether he had a foreign\npassport. Any personal conduct concerns raised by this inaccuracy on his e-QIP would\nbe mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct\nthe omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the\ntotality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant maintains that his sole allegiance is to the United States, where he has\nchosen to make his home and career for the past 40 years. The salient issue in the\nsecurity clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty or allegiance, but rather what\nis clearly consistent with the national interest. See Executive Order 10865, Section 7.\nFor the reasons addressed above, Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence\nconcerns, and his carelessness in completing the e-QIP does not raise sufficient\npersonal conduct concerns to justify denying him continued access to classified\ninformation. Concerning his acts of foreign preference, Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with\nAG \u00b6 11(d) concerning the surrender or invalidation of his foreign passport does not bar\nhim from a security clearance, but there must be compelling reasons to deviate from the\npolicy guidance. Applicant\u2019s expertise in a field vital to the nation\u2019s defense is\nundisputed. On the other hand, it is troubling that he has taken no affirmative acts to\naddress the concerns surrounding his Israeli passport. Applicant could have gone a\nlong way toward demonstrating his willingness to relinquish his foreign passport and\nrenounce his foreign citizenship by starting the process, or short of that, by promising\nthat he would not travel to Israel until after his Israeli citizenship had been revoked. He\nhas not provided evidence that he sought any guidance or assistance from security\nofficials about the passport issue. In light of the unmitigated foreign preference\nconcerns, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto renew his security clearance at this time.\n\n14\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to renew Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 1, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions)\n\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Department\nCounsel requested a hearing.  On July 29, 2011, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Claude R.\nHeiny denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant  appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 54 years old.  In\nSeptember 2005, Applicant informed her company\u2019s security office that she believed she was being\nstalked 24 hours a day, seven days a week by persons unknown.  In December 2005 she went to the\npolice, because she was being stalked in various locations.  Neither company officials nor the police\ndepartment told Applicant they were unable to substantiate her concerns.  She never returned to the\npolice and she never talked further with company officials after relating her initial concerns.  On\nvarious other occasions between 2005 and 2010, Applicant states that she was followed home or to\nother locations by vehicles, that other vehicles stalked her or drove aggressively toward her on the\nhighways.  After one incident where the police did not perceive a problem, Applicant stated that she\ndid not feel she was being taken seriously and that no one believed her suspicions.  In 2007,\nApplicant filed a hostile environment complaint with her company\u2019s ethics office.  She reported\nseveral incidents with three men whom she claimed were behaving in a hostile manner toward her.\nAn investigation determined there was no problem with the men.\nIn July 2010, Applicant was evaluated by a clinical psychologist.  Tests and an interview\nwere conducted.  The evaluation included the observation that Applicant denied any unusual\nthinking except the feeling that she was being followed.  The psychologist also reported that\nApplicant engaged in a lengthy discussion about various individuals following her for a number of\nyears in a number of situations.  Applicant could not be dissuaded by any logical arguments to the\ncontrary.  The diagnostic impression was 294.9 Cognitive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS),\nand 297.1 Delusional Disorder NOS.  A Global Assessment of Functioning was rated \u201c50\u201d which\nindicates serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning.  The psychologist\nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s neuropsychological status appeared impaired, and that her delusions\ncould be quite severe at times and appeared to account for some flaws in her thinking and interaction\nwith others.  The psychologist stated that \u201cunfortunately, it is not known at this time whether her\njudgment and reliability in the future can be ascertained or fully determined without further medical\nand neuropsychological evaluation.\u201d  \nThe evaluation recommended Applicant see a neurologist.  She did so in November 2010.\nShe had an MRI which revealed no problems.  She told the neurologist her physician had\nrecommended she see a neurologist.  She never gave the neurologist a copy of the psychologist\u2019s\nfindings and recommendations.  She saw the neurologist again the day before the hearing.  Applicant\nstated the neurologist could give a full report.  Applicant was given two weeks to provide any\nadditional information, to include a report of the neurologist\u2019s findings.  No information was\nreceived.  Applicant never considered obtaining a second opinion as to her mental state.  Although\nconcerned about the psychologist\u2019s letter, Applicant did not have a problem with the\nrecommendation.\n\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions:  Since at least 2005, Applicant believes she\nhas been stalked 24 hours a day, seven days a week by persons unknown.  She could not be\ndissuaded by any logical arguments to the contrary.  The clinical psychologist found Applicant\u2019s\nneuropsychological status was impaired, and it is unknown whether Applicant\u2019s future judgment and\nreliability could be ascertained or fully be determined without further medical and\nneuropsychological evaluation.  Even though she was aware the clinical psychologist believed she\nwas delusional, she never considered obtaining a second opinion as to her mental state.  Applicant\nmeets none of the mitigating factors.  There is no favorable prognosis.  There is no recent opinion\nthat the condition is under control, is cured, is in remission or has a low probability of recurrence.\nThere is no indication the condition was temporary and that it has been resolved.  The record raises\nunresolved questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\nApplicant asserts that the Judge committed numerous factual errors, and also takes issue with\nsome of the written statements made by the clinical psychologist that were entered into evidence.\nApplicant argues that the Judge used past-tense terms \u201csuffered from\u201d and \u201chad\u201d when referring to\nher condition, thus indicating that it was a one-time, past event and not a current cause for concern.\nApplicant also states that she \u201cexpected more consideration to be given [by the Judge] for the whole-\nperson concept.\u201d  Applicant also raised a matter of procedure.  She indicated that she was not\nproperly informed of the procedures, or what was expected of her, after her receipt of the clinical\npsychologist\u2019s report.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.  \nApplicant claims the Judge erred in making numerous detailed findings of fact.  Many of\nApplicant\u2019s claims in this area are difficult to understand and she does not relate how the errors are\nprejudicial to her case.  There is no presumption of error below.  The burden is on the appealing\nparty to establish harmful error on the part of the Judge.  To the extent that the Board cannot\nunderstand Applicant\u2019s assertions of fact-finding error, or cannot determine how the errors undercut\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions in the case, the Applicant has not met her burden.  In those instances where\nthe Board can ascertain the claims of fact-finding error and the alleged consequences of those\nclaims,  we note that most of the assertions of error involve minor date discrepancies and minute\ndetails surrounding various episodes of perceived stalking, perceived hostility, and interactions\nbetween Applicant and the clinical psychologist.  After a review of the record and the Judge\u2019s\ndecision, the Board concludes that any factual errors made by the Judge were harmless in nature.\nApplicant contests the factual accuracy of assertions made in several of the documents\nadmitted into evidence, primarily the clinical psychologist\u2019s report.  A party\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions\nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at\n3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  Here, Applicant is merely repeating arguments concerning the nature\nof the evidence that were made below, rather than making claims of error on the part of the Judge.\nApplicant notes that the Judge used the past tense in several instances when referring to her\ndiagnosed condition (\u201chad\u201d as opposed to \u201chas\u201d and \u201csuffered from\u201d as opposed to \u201csuffers from\u201d).\nShe claims this supports her assertion that the condition was a one-time, past event that is no longer\nof security significance.  The Board does not review sentences or passages in a Judge\u2019s decision in\n\n1As pointed out by Department Counsel, Applicant was appropriately provided with specific, post-examination\nrecommendations from the DOD clinical psychologist that were medically based.  Also, the Judge left the record open\nfor two weeks post-hearing to allow Applicant to submit purported matters in mitigation from a neurologist she was\nseeing at the recommendation of the clinical psychologist.  No additional matters were submitted by Applicant.   \nisolation, but rather will look to the whole of the Judge\u2019s decision to determine the meaning of a\nparticular portion of that decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-33144 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 2004).\nAfter a review of the Judge\u2019s whole decision, it is clear that the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s\ncondition is ongoing and there are no current prospects for addressing it.  These findings are\nreasonably supported by the record evidence.  Applicant has not established error.    \n  \nApplicant states that she \u201cexpected more\u201d from the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis, but does\nnot elaborate.  After a review of the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board is satisfied that he gave appropriate\nconsideration to the various \u201cwhole-person\u201d factors and the framework for analysis contained\ntherein.\nApplicant raises some arguments relating to procedure, stating that DOHA did not properly\ninform her of procedures or what was expected of her after the clinical psychologist submitted her\nreport, and that she expected \u201csomething different\u201d from DOHA\u2013although she does not clearly\nindicate what.  Although not a model of clarity, other comments by Applicant in this portion of her\nbrief seem to indicate that she is commenting on a lack of direction on the part of DOHA regarding\nwhat to do medically after the submission of the psychologist\u2019s report.  DOHA adjudicates security\nclearance eligibility.  Notwithstanding the fact that the clinical psychologist conducted her\nevaluation of Applicant\u2019s mental condition at the request of the Department of Defense, DOHA\nwould not be in a position to get involved in any post-report medical treatment of Applicant, nor\ncould it properly comment upon, or interject itself into, the ongoing treatment or recommendations\nof medical personnel.  Thus, DOHA breached no duty to Applicant regarding instructions as to her\nongoing medical care.  Applicant has not established that her due process rights were violated.1\n   In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of the mitigating factors listed under\nGuideline I, and indicated why the mitigating conditions did not apply.  Critical to the Judge\u2019s\nultimate determination in this case was his conclusions that, at the time of the hearing, nothing\nmeaningful was being done to address Applicant\u2019s diagnosed condition.  This led to the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that there were significant doubts about her eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  These conclusions are reasonably supported by the record evidence.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nIn August 2010, a clinical psychologist diagnosed Applicant with a cognitive \ndisorder and a delusional disorder. The psychologist found Applicant\u2019s suffered from \ndelusions. Applicant failed to rebut or mitigate the psychological conditions security \nconcerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) intent to deny or revoke \nher eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive \nOrder and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \n \n1 \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006. \nJuly 29, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 1, 2010, detailing security concerns under \nGuideline I, psychological conditions. \n  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR, she did not request a hearing, but \nDepartment Counsel did. Government\u2019s request for a hearing was made Hearing Exhibit \n(H Ex.) II. On March 2, 2011, I was assigned the case. On March 21, 2011, DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing for the hearing held on April 12, 2011.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel also offered copies of the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, \nDSM-IV-TR for 294.9 and 297.1, which were admitted as H Ex. I. Applicant testified on \nher own behalf and submitted Exhibit A, which was admitted into evidence without \nobjection. On April 20, 2011, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nOn April 12, 2011, the Government moved to amend the SOR because the \nwording of Guideline I was from an earlier, outdated version of the DoD Directive \n5220.6. The motion requesting the current wording of Guideline I be substituted for the \nearlier wording was granted. (H Ex. III, Tr. 18, 127) The decision will be based on the \nwording of the current Directive. Although the wording of Guideline I changed, the \nallegations remained the same. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she admitted the factual allegations, but \ndenied her the police or company employees were unable to substantiate her \nassertions. She also denied in SOR 1.d. that she had not sought professional \nassistance or counseling. I incorporate Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old senior administration associate who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since July 1991, and seeks to maintain a security clearance. \nApplicant called no witnesses other than herself, and produced no work or character \nreferences.  \n \n \nIn September 2005, Applicant informed her company\u2019s security office that she \nbelieved she was being stalked 24 hours a day, seven days a week by persons \nunknown. (Ex. 2. Tr. 75) She believed the unknown persons may have been from her \nwork. In December 2005, she went to the local police because she was being stalked. \n(Ex. 2) In her police affidavit, she listed events at a local discount store, at her \napartment, and being following to church, to work, and to her mother\u2019s home in another \ntown. She stated she noticed two men sitting in front of a discount department store \n\n \n3 \n \nwhen she entered. (Tr. 29) They followed her into the store and followed her when she \nleft the store. The two then returned to the store. (Tr. 30). A couple of weeks later, she \nwent to a different store of the same store chain in another city when a car followed her \nfor approximately a mile after leaving the store before that car drove a in different \ndirection. (Tr. 32) She did not recognize the individuals in the vehicle that followed her \nand never saw them again. (Tr. 32) \n \n \nApplicant was driving to her mother\u2019s place, when a car that had been behind \nher, pulled up beside her, then in front of her, and applied the brakes. (Tr. 37) When \nApplicant changed lanes, the other car would speed up. When she tried to get back into \nthe slow lane, the other car would hit their brakes. This happened four times before the \nother car drove off. (Tr. 37) The people in the other car were in their twenties. (Tr. 38)  \n \n \nIn later 2005 or in 2006, Applicant retuned to her apartment from grocery \nshopping when she heard someone come up the stairs at her apartment, knocked on \nher door, and then jiggled the door knob before departing. (Tr. 34) In 2006 or 2007, she \nnoticed a truck followed her from the highway to her apartment complex. She later \nnoticed the vehicle was still there with its engine running. \n \n \nNeither company officials nor the police department told Applicant they were \nunable to substantiate her concerns. (Tr. 74, 135) She never talked with company \nofficials after relating her initial concerns about being followed 24/7. The company told \nher the findings related to her hostile work complaint discussed below. After initially \nmaking her complaint, she has not returned to the police. (Tr. 144) \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant filed a hostile environment complaint with her company\u2019s \nethics office. (Ex. 2) She reported three men made inappropriate comments to her at \nwork. While walking down the hall, one of the men lunged at her. (Tr. 82). She believed \na hostile environment was created when another of the three said to her, \u201cgood to see \nyou; you\u2019re here.\u201d (Tr. 84) Another individual said, \u201cIt\u2019s about time you got here; or, Oh, \nyou\u2019re here; or, you know, Where you been.\u201d An investigation determined there was no \nproblem with any of the men. The investigator interviewed the men who stated they had \nno problem with Applicant. (Tr. 81) She never received a report after the ethics office \ntold her their findings. (Tr. 88)  \n \n \nDuring the summer of 2007, a vehicle swerved into her lane for no reason. In \nAugust or September 2008, Applicant\u2019s neighbor told her a young man between 19 and \n22 in her complex had pointed his hand at her door and motioned as if he was shooting \nthe door with a gun. (Tr. 44, 72) Three weeks later, she called 911 and related the \nincident. The police talked to the young man who said he had not meant to offend \nApplicant. (Ex. 2) In January 2009, she stated she did not feel she was being taken \nseriously and wanted someone to talk with her about any investigation that had been \nconducted. Applicant did not think anyone believed her suspicions. (Ex. 2) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                          \n \nIn June 2010, Applicant was again driving to her mother\u2019s home and had pulled \non to the interstate highway when an incident occurred with three cars. (Tr. 40) The \nthree vehicles appeared to be traveling together. When she sped up, they sped up. \nWhen she slowed down they did too. This continued for approximately five miles. Later \nshe noticed the police had pulled the cars over. The police then stopped Applicant and \nasked her if she knew the individuals in the three cars. (Tr. 41) She did not. She has not \nfollowed up with the police about this incident. (Tr. 42) Also in 2010, Applicant and her \nsister were driving to her mother\u2019s place, when a vehicle came up behind her and the \ndriver started blowing his horn and flashing his lights. (Tr. 95) She drove to the city \nsquare, where the driver from the other car asked her if she was alright or if she needed \nhelp. (Tr. 95) Applicant stated the other driver appeared angry. (Tr. 112) The other \ndriver stated she was going slow, 20 m.p.h. (Tr. 97) Although a number of the incidents \ninvolve Applicant driving her car, she never thought the other individuals might be upset \nwith her due to the way she was driving. (Tr. 113)  \n \n \nIn June 2010, Applicant was evaluated by a clinical psychologist. During the first \ntwo visits, Applicant was given a series of tests.2 During the third visit, she talked with \nthe clinical psychologist. (Tr. 120) The psychological evaluation states: \n \n. . . she showed a generally even and positive attitude and denied any \nunusual thinking except feeling that she was being followed. A long \ndiscussion about this ensued with [Applicant] presenting details about \nvarious individuals following her for a number of years, in a number of \nsituations. She could not be dissuaded by any logical arguments to the \ncontrary. (Ex. A)  \n \n \nThe diagnostic impression listed in Axis I3 was \u201c294.9 Cognitive Disorder Not \nOtherwise specified\u201d and \u201c297.1 Delusional Disorder NOS.\u201d (H. Ex. I, Ex. 3) Additionally, \nApplicant was extensively interviewed and her file carefully reviewed. (Ex. 3, Ex. A, Tr. \n110) Axis V4 gave a GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning) as 50, which indicates \nserious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning. \n \n \nThe Report of Psychological Evaluations recommendations stated: \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] neuropsychological status appears impaired at this time. \nThese moderate to moderately severe spatial and conceptual problems \n \n2 The tests included: the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Sheehan Anxiety Inventory, the Minnesota \nMultiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the 16 PF Personality Factor profile, a Thematic Apperception \nTest, Rorschach tests, Incomplete Sentence Blank, Life Script, Wechsler Memory scale test, the Raven\u2019s \nProgressive matrices, the Shipley Institute of Living test, conceptual tests, the Halstead Reitan test, and \nthe Hooper Visual Organization test. (Ex. 3) \n \n3 Axis I is \u201cPrimary Diagnostic Impression,\u201d which lists clinical disorders or other conditions that may be a \nfocus of clinical attention.  \n \n4 Axis V is Global Assessment of Functioning Diagnostic Impression Stage. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                          \ncould possibly account for her episodes of psychotic thinking. Her \ndelusions are quite specific but appear episodic, as she is quite certain at \ntimes that she is being followed but these are discrete episodes rather \nthan daily events. . . Later testing showed some neuropsychological \ndeficits as noted above. It is possible that theses events are episodic and \npossibly related to some un-diagnosed medical condition which causes \nsome neuropsychological deficits . . . These can be quite severe at times \nand appear to account for some flaws in her thinking and interaction with \nothers . . . Unfortunately it is not known at this time whether her judgment \nand reliability in the future can be ascertained or fully be determined \nwithout further medical and neuropsychological evaluation. (Ex. 3, Ex. A)  \n \n \nOnce the evaluation was completed, the clinical psychologist called Applicant to \ndiscuss her findings. In discussing the material, it was noticed that minor changes to the \nevaluation were necessary. (Tr. 47) A second Report of Psychological Evaluation was \nmade two days after the first. (Ex. A) The changes in that second evaluation appear \nhere in quotations. The diagnostic impression in Axis I remained the same. To Axis III5 \nwas added \u201cHistory of sleep apnea.\u201d To the Recommendations section was added the \nsentence \u201dIt is noted that she has a history of sleep apnea since 2004.\u201d In the \nIntellectual and Neuropsychological test result section was added to the non verbal \nintelligence test, Raven\u2019s Progressive matrices she scored in the \u201clowest\u201d twenty \npercentile. The results of the Shipley Institute of Living scale show overall intelligence \n\u201cin the low average range.\u201d The degree of conceptual loss is difficult to determine \u201cbut \ndoes appear to be significant.\u201d Applicant received copies of both letters. (Tr. 49) \n \n \nThe evaluation recommended Applicant see a neurologist because of her \nmemory loss, which she did in November 2010. (Tr. 52) She had an MRI, which \nrevealed no problems. (Tr. 54) She told the neurologist her physician had \nrecommended she see a neurologist. She never gave the neurologist a copy of the \npsychologist\u2019s findings and recommendations. (Tr. 125) The neurologist did not \nprescribe any medicine. (Tr. 58) She saw the neurologist again the day before the \nhearing. Applicant stated the neurologist could give a full report. (Tr. 101) Applicant was \ngiven two weeks to provide any additional information to include a report of the \nneurologist\u2019s findings. (Tr. 102, 124) No information was received.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant asked the clinical psychologist why she thought Applicant was \ndelusional, the psychologist stated because of the test results and Applicant\u2019s spotty \nmemory. (Tr. 115) Applicant never considered obtaining a second opinion as to her \nmental state. (Tr. 121) Although concerned about the psychologist\u2019s letter, Applicant did \nnot have a problem with the recommendation. (Tr. 121)  \n \n \nApplicant asserts she has great interpersonal relationships with people. (Tr. 137) \nExcept for the underlying factors of the ethics report, she asserts she never had a \n \n5 Axis III: General Medical Diagnostic Impression. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nproblem with coworkers. (Tr. 135) She has never had a clearance violation. (Tr. 137) \nShe asserts her employer never advised her to seek additional counseling. (Tr. 136) \nApplicant believes there was never a totally independent investigation into her \nallegations. (Tr. 139)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \n\n \n7 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 27 articulates the security concerns relating to \npsychological problems: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality disorders can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not \nrequired for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist), \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of seeking mental healthy counseling.  \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include (AG 28):  \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual=s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but \nnot limited to emotional unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, \nparanoid, or bizarre behavior; \n \n \n(b) An opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may \nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; \n \n(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a \ndiagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g. failure to take \nprescribed medication.  \n \n \nSince at least 2005, Applicant believes she has been stalked 24 hours a day, \nseven days a week by persons unknown. She believed the unknown persons may be \nfrom her work. In 2005, she reported her concerns to her employer and to the local \npolice department. In June 2010, Applicant was evaluated by a clinical psychologist. \nDuring her first two visits, Applicant was given a series of tests and during the third visit \nhad a long discussion in which she presented details about various individuals following \nher for a number of years and in a number of situations. Applicant could not be \ndissuaded by any logical arguments to the contrary. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe diagnostic impression was that Applicant suffered from \u201c294.9 Cognitive \nDisorder Not Otherwise specified\u201d and \u201c297.1 Delusional Disorder NOS.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nGAF score was 50, which indicates serious impairment in social, occupational, or school \nfunctioning. The clinical psychologist found Applicant\u2019s neuropsychological status was \nimpaired and it is unknown whether Applicant\u2019s future judgment and reliability could be \nascertained or fully be determined without further medical and neuropsychological \nevaluation. Even though Applicant was aware the clinical psychologist believed she was \ndelusional, she never considered obtaining a second opinion as to her mental state. I \nfind AG 28(a) and 28(b) apply. \n \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns include (AG 29):  \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in emotional, mental, or \npersonality disorder is cured, under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one \ncaused by a death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been \nresolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotionally \ninstability; or  \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \n \n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors. AG 29(a) and 29(b) require \ncompliance with a treatment plan or enrollment in a counseling program. Since being \nnotified of the diagnosis and findings, she has not sought additional counseling or \nobtained a second opinion related to her mental status. There is no favorable prognosis. \nNeither AG 29(a) nor 29 (b) apply. AG 29(c) does not apply because there is no recent \nopinion that the condition is under control, is cured, in remission, or has a low probability \nof recurrence. AG 29(d) does not apply because there is no indication the condition was \ntemporary and that it has been resolved. There is nothing in the record indicating there \nis no current problem. AG 29(e) does not apply.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. For at least the last five and a half \nyears, Applicant believes she is being followed twenty-four hours a day, seven days a \nweek. A number of the incidents relate to Applicant\u2019s driving and it does not appear she \nis being followed. Her coworkers\u2019 comments, as she related them, fail to establish a \nhostile work environment and the company found such. A qualified clinical psychologist \ndetermined Applicant had a delusional disorder and a cognitive disorder. There is \nnothing in the record indicating any changes to these diagnoses. These disorders raise \nconcerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant not mitigated the security concerns arising from her psychological \nconditions.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Psychological Conditions: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1. d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that Applicant was arrested in May 2004 for domestic breaking and entering, domestic disorderly conduct, and willful trespass, which led to a no contact order (SOR 1.a); that he was arrested and convicted in June 2004 for driving while intoxicated (DWI), first offense (SOR 1.b); that he was arrested in May 2005 for domestic-simple assault, for which he received a suspended one-year prison sentence and one-year probation, and for domestic-refusal to relinquish telephone (dismissed) (SOR 1.c); that he was arrested and found guilty of a June 2005 domestic vandalism/malicious injury to property charge (SOR 1.d); and that he was arrested and convicted of two counts of marijuana possession after having consumed alcohol in August 2006 (SOR 1.e). The June 2004 DWI and August 2006 marijuana possession and refusal to submit to chemical test offenses were cross-alleged (SOR 2.b.) under Guideline G, Alcohol 1 Consumption.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant used marijuana from 1978 to at least August 2006, and consumed\nalcohol to excess from about 1979 to at least April 2007. He was arrested five times\nbetween May 2004 and August 2006 on domestic abuse, alcohol, or marijuana-related\ncharges. He abstained from alcohol and illegal drug use since being treated for alcohol\ndependence in 2007, but he has been lax in his commitment to Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) of late. He deliberately did not disclose his marijuana involvement or his alcohol\ntreatment on his April 2008 security clearance application. He also owes about $125,000\nin medical debt that he does not intend to repay. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  (e-\nQIP) on April 22, 2008. On June 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption,\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline F,\nFinancial Considerations, that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him\n\nPresumably, the August 2006 charges were cross-alleged under Guideline G because the available\n1\ninformation showed that Applicant consumed alcohol before his arrest.\n2\na security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant submitted an undated response to the SOR, which was received by\nDOHA on August 25, 2009. He requested a hearing, and on September 30, 2009, the\ncase was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On October 16, 2009, I\nscheduled a hearing for November 17, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Fourteen Government exhibits (Ex. 1-14)\nwere entered into evidence. Exhibits 1 and 4, consisting of the police reports of\nApplicant\u2019s respective arrests in May 2004 and May 2005, were admitted over his\nobjections. The reports were admissible under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive. Applicant\u2019s\nclaim of police bias as to Exhibit 1 was not established. Objections on the basis of\nhearsay as to Exhibit 4 were taken into account in assessing the weight afforded the\ninformation. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript received on November 25,\n2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that Applicant was\narrested in May 2004 for domestic breaking and entering, domestic disorderly conduct,\nand willful trespass, which led to a no contact order (SOR 1.a); that he was arrested and\nconvicted in June 2004 for driving while intoxicated (DWI), first offense (SOR 1.b); that\nhe was arrested in May 2005 for domestic-simple assault, for which he received a\nsuspended one-year prison sentence and one-year probation, and for domestic-refusal\nto relinquish telephone (dismissed) (SOR 1.c); that he was arrested and found guilty of a\nJune 2005 domestic vandalism/malicious injury to property charge (SOR 1.d); and that\nhe was arrested and convicted of two counts of marijuana possession after having\nconsumed alcohol in August 2006 (SOR 1.e).\nThe June 2004 DWI and August 2006 marijuana possession and refusal to submit\nto chemical test offenses were cross-alleged (SOR 2.b.) under Guideline G,  Alcohol\n1\nConsumption. Applicant was also alleged under Guideline G to have consumed alcohol\nat times excessively from at least 1979 to at least 2007 (SOR 2.a) and to have received\ntreatment for diagnosed alcohol dependence from about February 23, 2007, until May\n22, 2007 (SOR 2.c).\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, the SOR alleged that Applicant used\nmarijuana from about 1978 to at least 2006 with varying frequency, to include a period of\nthree to four times weekly use (SOR 3.a), and that he was convicted of the August 2006\n\nApplicant testified that he worked hard in the fishing industry, and bought his first house when he was\n2\n19. At the age of 24, he purchased a home for his family because they had been renting. (Tr. 58.)\n3\nmarijuana possession charges (SOR 3.b). Alleged Guideline E, Personal Conduct,\nconcerns related to false negative responses to the illegal drug use and alcohol\ntreatment questions on his e-QIP (SOR 4.a, 4.b).\nUnder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, the SOR alleged that Applicant\nowed $127,826 in medical debt that had not been satisfied by March 2009 (SOR 5.a-5.i).\nApplicant denied those allegations because they were related to health issues and were\n\u201cpersonal.\u201d \nApplicant did not dispute the allegations under guidelines J, G, H, and E, although\nhe asserted that he had been sober for over two years and was doing well in his\nrecovery. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old college graduate, who has worked as a mechanical\ntechnician for a defense contractor since April 2008. He seeks his first Department of\nDefense security clearance. (Tr. 12, 64.)\nApplicant worked in the fishing industry starting at age 16 until he went off to\ncollege at about age 25. (Tr. 58.) From 1988 to 1992, he attended college on a U.S.\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) scholarship. (Ex. 12, Tr. 59.) He married in August 1991.\nAfter he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree, he went to work for the DOE, where he was\ngranted an \u201cL\u201d clearance (Ex. 12.) In 1993, he and his ex-wife had a daughter. In 1994,\nthey had a son. (Ex. 12, Tr. 60.) Applicant was laid off from his government employment\nin 1996. He and his ex-spouse worked as substitute teachers until 1997, when they\nmoved for her to attend graduate school. school. Applicant stayed at home to care for\ntheir children. (Tr. 60-61.) In May 2000, Applicant and his ex-wife divorced. (Ex. 12.)\nApplicant returned to his present locale, where he owned a home (Tr. 58, 61, 65),  and to\n2\na \u201cfishing life\u201d that included abuse of alcohol and marijuana. (Tr. 61.) He was a self-\nemployed commercial fisherman on a succession of fishing boats from October 2000 to\nOctober 2006, and from March 2008 to at least April 2008. (Ex. 12.)\nApplicant\u2019s history of illicit drug involvement started around 1978 or 1978. He\nsmoked marijuana once weekly from around 1978 or 1979 until 2000, and then three or\nfour times per week until sometime in 2006. He also tried several other illegal drugs\nalthough no heroin. (Tr. 119.) Following an arrest for illegal marijuana possession in\nAugust 2006, he ceased his illegal drug involvement. (Ex. 11.) In October 2008, he was\nprescribed Vicodin for pain following a dental procedure. He used the drug as\nprescribed, but he also felt that he was abusing it since he needed to take only a couple\nof pills for pain and he took all 20 prescribed. (Tr. 116-17.)\nApplicant abused alcohol with varying frequency from about 1979 to April 2007,\nwith some periods of heavy use and binge drinking. From about 1979 until 1984,\nApplicant consumed liquor once weekly, to intoxication a few times per month. He\n\nApplicant testified that he engaged in binge drinking around 2004. (Tr. 123.)\n3\nApplicant now indicates that he felt coerced into signing an affidavit (Ex. 11) detailing the extent of\n4\nhis drinking and marijuana abuse. But he also testified that his drug use and alcohol consumption were much\nworse than what was recorded in the affidavit. (Tr. 121.) W hen asked for details, he indicated that the reality\nwas not worse but different. (Tr. 122.) There is no evidence that suggests a motive for the investigator to\nreport other than what Applicant told him, and Applicant signed the affidavit.\nW hen asked whether there were other occasions where he drank too much and drove a vehicle\n5\nwhere he was not caught, Applicant responded, \u201cI would assume that I drank every other time, didn\u2019t get\ncaught.\u201d As for whether he was under the influence of alcohol in the five criminal incidents, Applicant testified,\n\u201cI would say yeah.\u201d (Tr. 127.)\n4\nabstained from alcohol for the next few years, but following back surgery in 1984, be\nbecame addicted to prescribed codeine. (Tr. 124.) From 1987 to until 1989, he drank two\nor three beers or wine or both on the weekends, a few times per month, becoming\nintoxicated on occasion. He limited his drinking to moderate levels of gin a couple times\nper month from 1989 to 1997. From 1997 to 2000, he consumed three or four glasses of\nwine a few times a week, becoming intoxicated a few times each month. From 2000 to\nabout June 2005, Applicant drank gin three to four times per week, in quantities ranging\nfrom three to ten drinks and regularly to intoxication.  He then drank at least two or three\n3\ndrinks twice or three times weekly at times until April 15, 2007.  (Ex. 10, 11, Tr. 61.) \n4\nApplicant continued to abuse primarily alcohol (Tr. 70.), but he also smoked\nmarijuana despite a familiarity with AA starting in 2000. (Tr. 72.) He was arrested five\ntimes for various offenses between May 2004 and August 2006. In May 2004, Applicant\nhad an  argument with a girlfriend. He had entered her home with a key but without her\npermission, and he was arrested on a warrant about four hours later for domestic\nbreaking and entering in a dwelling house without consent, for domestic-disorderly\nconduct, and for willful trespass. (Ex. 1, 11.) Applicant was suspected of being under the\ninfluence of alcohol. (Ex. 1.) When searched incident to his arrest on a warrant, the\npolice found a marijuana pipe containing marijuana residue on him. The domestic\nbreaking and entering charge was dismissed, and the willful trespass charge was filed,\nalthough a no contact order was issued. He was fined $200 for marijuana possession but\nthat charge was expunged. (Ex. 11.)\nIn June 2004, Applicant was pulled over by the police for a stop sign violation. He\nhad consumed about three alcohol drinks earlier, and he failed field sobriety tests. He\nwas charged with misdemeanor DWI, first offense, with a blood alcohol level between\n.08% and .10%. (Ex. 2, 11.) In August 2004, he pleaded no contest, and was sentenced\nto a fine of about $750, community service, and 30 days loss of license.  (Ex. 3, 11.)\n5\nIn May 2005, Applicant was arrested on charges of domestic assault and\ndomestic refusal  to relinquish a telephone involving a former girlfriend. He threw her\nagainst the wall, tore off her clothes during an argument, prevented her from using her\ncell phone, and blocked her exit. (Ex. 4, 11.) Ten days later, he pleaded no contest to a\nmisdemeanor charge of domestic simple assault, and was sentenced to one year in\nprison (suspended), one-year probation, and domestic abuse counseling. The other\ncharge was dismissed. (Ex. 5, 11.)\n\nAlleged in SOR 5.f and 5.g are two separate medical debts of $2,630 with the same account numbers\n6\nbut for the last digit. The evidence does not conclusively establish whether SOR 5.g represents a duplicate\nlisting by the credit bureaus or is an additional balance. The Government presented no information about the\nidentity of the original creditor.\n5\nIn June 2005, Applicant was charged with domestic vandalism and malicious\ninjury to property belonging to his then girlfriend, with whom he had a four-year\nrelationship. They had consumed alcohol at a bar together earlier that evening, but she\nbecame angry with him and went home. Applicant showed up at her house and they\nargued when she refused him entry. \u201cInfuriated\u201d with her, Applicant threw a rock through\na window of her car. He was arrested a few hours later, and held without bail for two\ndays for violating his probation for the May 2005 domestic assault. (Ex. 5, 6, 7, 11.) In\nJuly 2005, he pleaded no contest to one count of misdemeanor domestic vandalism and\nwas sentenced to one year in prison, suspended, one-year probation, domestic abuse\ncounseling, restitution, and court costs. A no contact order was also issued. (Ex. 7, 11.)\nFor violating his probation, he was sentenced to six months house confinement. (Ex. 5,\n11.)\nIn August 2006, Applicant was pulled over by the police after he hopped a curb.\nApplicant exhibited signs of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both\n(moderate odor of alcohol on breath, bloodshot, watery, and glassy eyes, slurred\nspeech), and he failed field sobriety tests. He had consumed alcohol and smoked\nmarijuana earlier that evening. After he was placed in custody, the police found a full\nmarijuana cigarette in a container of tobacco, and \u201cburnt down\u201d marijuana cigarettes in\nthe center console of his vehicle. Applicant refused a chemical test, but a field test on the\nmarijuana was positive for the drug. Applicant was charged with possession of\nmarijuana, first offense, and refusal to submit to a chemical test (second offense due to\nthe earlier DWI). In October 2006, he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor marijuana\npossession, and was placed on one-year probation. The misdemeanor criminal charge of\nrefusal to submit to a chemical test was dismissed. (Ex. 8, 9, 11.) He was also issued\ncivil citations for refusal to submit to a chemical test (second offense) and obedience to\ntraffic control devices. In December 2006, he was fined $75 for the traffic control device\ncitation. The refusal to submit to a chemical test was dismissed due to an error in the\npaperwork. (Ex. 8.)\nApplicant had a serious medical emergency in October 2006, when he had no\nmedical insurance (Tr. 61-62). He incurred a hospital debt of $120,776 (SOR 5.a) and\nother medical debts totaling $4,753. In about June 2007, Applicant paid two of the\nsmaller debts totaling $316 (not alleged in the SOR) that had been in collection since\nFebruary 2007. In June 2007, the rest of the smaller debts (SOR 5.b-5.f, 5.h, 5.i),  which\n6\nranged from a low of $29 to $2,630, were referred for collection. In September 2007, the\nhospital placed Applicant\u2019s account for collection with a balance due of $120,776 (SOR\n5.a). He contested the debt balance as excessive without success. (Tr. 62.) As of March\n2009, none of the medical debts were paid. (Ex. 13, 14.)\n\nApplicant testified that he would not describe his use of mood-altering substances other than alcohol\n7\nas abusive. (Tr. 125.)\n6\nHis medical problem led him to realize that he had an alcohol problem.  (Tr. 73.)\n7\nBecause of his substance abuse offenses, Applicant was referred by the state to a\nlicensed substance abuse program, where he received treatment for diagnosed alcohol\ndependence from February 23, 2007, until May 22, 2007. His treatment consisted of\nindividual sessions, AA meetings, and random drug screens, which were negative for\ndrugs tested. He attended AA regularly, up to 10 to 12 meetings per week (Tr. 71.),\nalthough he apparently relapsed while in treatment, as he dates his sobriety from April\n15, 2007. (Tr. 118.) At discharge, his alcohol dependence was in remission, and it was\nrecommended that he abstain from alcohol, avoid high risk situations, continue his AA\nattendance, and call his counselor in the event of a relapse. (Ex. 10, 11.)\nApplicant began his defense contractor employment in April 2008 at $12 an hour.\n(Tr. 99.) His attendance at AA declined to twice a week because of his second shift work\nschedule. (Tr. 71.) On April 22, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP on which he\ndisclosed his arrests for drunk driving in August 2004, for domestic simple assault in May\n2005, and for misdemeanor marijuana possession in August 2006. In response to the\nfinancial delinquency inquiries, he listed medical debt in collection totaling $127,276. He\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24.a concerning whether he had illegally used any controlled\nsubstance, including marijuana, within the last seven years, and to question 25\nconcerning whether his use of alcohol had resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or\ncounseling in the last seven years. (Ex. 12.) Applicant feared that an affirmative\nresponse to the drug inquiry would negatively affect his employability with the defense\ncontractor. (Tr. 102.) He did not disclose his alcohol counseling because he had been\nsober and felt \u201c[his] life was going in a different direction.\u201d  (Tr. 103.)\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on May 2, 2008, revealed not only the medical debts,\nbut also that he had settled other accounts in collection for less than their full balances. A\ncredit card with a high credit of $977 had been settled in December 2006. In November\n2006, he settled a retail charge account that had been referred for collection for $9,300.\n(Ex. 13.)\nOn October 23, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his arrests, his illegal drug involvement, and his alcohol abuse and treatment.\nApplicant indicated that his last use of marijuana was in 2006 and he did not intend any\nfuture use. As for his alcohol consumption, Applicant related that he last drank alcohol in\n2007, was involved in AA, and had no future plans to consume alcohol. (Ex. 11.)\nAs of November 2009, Applicant was attending a couple of AA meetings per\nweek. He had a sponsor in AA for the past three years. (Tr. 71-72.) Applicant had not\nformally completed any steps of the AA program, although he had identified his character\ndefects and spoken about them to his AA sponsor. He contacted his sponsor once\nweekly and others in the AA program daily (Tr. 131-32.) Applicant felt he had a good\nnetwork within the AA fellowship to help him maintain sobriety. At work, Applicant did not\nhave a network of fellow attendees to confide in. Some coworkers drank alcohol on the\n\n7\njob or discussed drinking and partying (\u201cThey are all talking about partying all the time\nand drinking and partying and you\u2019re like oh, this sounds fun.\u201d). (Tr. 128-29.) It had not\nled Applicant to relapse into substance abuse (Tr. 130), although Applicant admitted that\nhe had not been attending as many AA meetings as he should of late (\u201cI\u2019ve been laxing\n[sic] a lot lately though, not going to as many meetings as I should and it\u2019s all because of\nmy schedule, it\u2019s not a good schedule and I make excuses not to go, and that could\neventually lead me to drinking so. . . .\u201d) (Tr. 133.) At his hearing, he produced for perusal\ntwo AA coins from his home group marking his two years of sobriety. (Tr.  136-37.) He\ndoes not intend to drink alcohol or to use an illegal drug in the future.\nAs of November 2009, Applicant\u2019s hourly wage was $18.60. (Tr. 73.) He owed\nabout $240 for two medical debts that he had neglected to pay in addition to the medical\ndebts alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 74-75.) He had not resolved any of the debts because he\nconsidered the charges excessive (\u201cI have a problem with thinking about the value\nbecause of exorbitant pricing . . . .\u201d). (Tr. 76-86.)  When asked at his hearing whether he\nintended to repay his medical debt, Applicant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have a logical answer\nfor you right now.\u201d (Tr. 87.) He had not contacted his creditors about resolving his\nmedical debt since shortly after he received treatment (Tr. 83-84.), and he had not heard\nfrom collection agencies in the past two years about those debts. (Tr. 88.) About 55% of\nhis net income went to his mortgage loan that he was repaying at $1,000 per month. (Tr.\n93, 96.) Applicant was seeking to refinance his mortgage to lower the interest rate from\neight percent so that he could put a new roof on the house. (Tr. 89-91.) Applicant was\nnot under any court order to pay child support, although he was giving his ex-wife $200\nor $300 a month for his children. (Tr. 94.) He had an estimated $600 in savings, but he\nalso testified that he had \u201czero\u201d discretionary income after paying his monthly expenses.\n(Tr. 95.)\nApplicant enjoys his job with the defense contractor. He testified that he was\nproductive and received maximum raises. (Tr. 63) In about October 2009, he was\nsuspended one day from work after his supervisor charged him with not reporting on his\ntime card that he had left work. (Tr. 138.)\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be\nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\n\n8\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present\nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15,\nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of\nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified\nor sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in Guideline J, AG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant contests the validity of the May 2004 charges, including for domestic\nbreaking and entering, on the grounds that he was living with his girlfriend, had entered\nthe premises with a key so did not need permission, and he was not convicted. (Tr. 112.)\nDismissed charges can be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s security suitability\nunder AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d Furthermore, there is\nevidence that undercuts his claim of no trespass. The address listed for him on the police\nreport is his current address and not her address. Furthermore, even assuming they\nwere cohabiting, Applicant acknowledged during his subject interview in October 2008\n\nTitle 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code provides as follows:\n8\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction\nof the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States,\nknowingly and willfully - (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device\na material fact; (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to\ncontain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under\nthis title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic\nterrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both. If the\nmatter relates to an offense under chapter 109A, 109B,110, or 117, or section 1591, then the\nterm of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be not more than 8 years. (b)\nSubsection (a) does not apply to a party to a judicial proceeding, or that party's counsel, for\nstatements, representations, writings or documents submitted by such party or counsel to a\njudge or magistrate in that proceeding. (c) W ith respect to any matter within the jurisdiction\nof the legislative branch, subsection (a) shall apply only to - (1) administrative matters,\nincluding a claim for payment, a matter related to the procurement of property or services,\npersonnel or employment practices, or support services, or a document required by law, rule,\nor regulation to be submitted to the Congress or any office or officer within the legislative\nbranch; or (2) any investigation or review, conducted pursuant to the authority of any\ncommittee, subcommittee, commission or office of the Congress, consistent with applicable\nrules of the House or Senate. \n9\nthat he entered without his girlfriend\u2019s permission. Applicant does not dispute the other\noffenses. He was caught driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content between\n.08% and .10% in June 2004. In May 2005, he physically assaulted a former girlfriend\nduring an argument, for which he was sentenced to one year in prison (suspended), and\none-year probation. Then, in June 2005,  he vandalized the car of a longtime girlfriend. In\nAugust 2006, he was in possession of marijuana when placed in custody on suspicions\nof driving under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or both. AG \u00b6 31(c) and AG \u00b6\n31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d apply. Furthermore, because\nthe June 2005 domestic vandalism was in violation of his probation for the May 2005\nassault, AG \u00b6 31(e), \u201cviolation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-\nmandated rehabilitation program,\u201d is also pertinent.\nWith the passage of over three years since his latest arrest, Applicant would\nappear to satisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d The absence of any recurrence since he began his defense contractor\nemployment in April 2008 is evidence of reform under AG \u00b632(d), \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d However, I cannot\nfully apply either AG \u00b6 32(a) or \u00b6 32(d) in light of his deliberate misrepresentations on his\nApril 2008 e-QIP (see Guideline E).The deliberate falsification of his e-QIP is felonious\nconduct under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.8\n\nAG \u00b6 23(b) specifically states: \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\n9\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d\n10\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nIn addition to the DWI offense, alcohol was involved in the June 2005 domestic\nvandalism offense because Applicant had been drinking in a bar before that arrest. AG \u00b6\n22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d is pertinent. Furthermore, Applicant engaged in binge drinking within\nthe meaning of AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d when he consumed regularly to intoxication and in\nquantity of up to ten gin drinks at a sitting. In addition, AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol\nabuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member\nof a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d applies. Applicant received outpatient\ntreatment for diagnosed alcohol dependence in a state licensed substance abuse\nprogram from February 23, 2007 to May 22, 2007.\nApplicant apparently drank while in treatment at some point, since he dates his\nsobriety from April 15, 2007. (Tr. 118.) Despite his present two-plus years of abstinence,\nI cannot give controlling weight in mitigation to AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or\nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d because of the seriousness of his alcohol problem.\nAs set forth in AG \u00b6 23(b), an applicant with diagnosed alcohol dependence should\nacknowledge his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, show evidence of actions\ntaken to overcome the problem, and establish a pattern of abstinence.  Applicant admits\n9\nhis abusive relationship with alcohol, including binge drinking around 2004. He considers\nalcohol \u201cthe worst drug there is\u201d (Tr. 127.), and relies on others involved in AA to help\nhim cope with the lack of support for his sobriety at work. He was compliant with his\nalcohol treatment, and his ongoing affiliation with AA is evidence of continued actions\ntaken to overcome his alcohol dependency problem. AG \u00b6 23(b) applies, but its weight in\nmitigation is not compelling, given his testimony that he has been lax in his AA\nattendance of late.\nHis successful completion of counseling with abstinence since April 2007 and\nparticipation in AA satisfies the treatment and aftercare requirements set out in AG \u00b6\n23(d):\n\nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21\n10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance.\n11\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling\nor rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a\nclear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in\nmeetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has\nreceived a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program.\nAs for the favorable prognosis required for mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(d), the only\ntreatment record available for review, the discharge summary from May 2007, does not\nspecifically state a diagnosis. However, Applicant\u2019s counselor assessed Applicant\u2019s\ncompletion as successful and his dependency in remission as of May 2007. The program\ndirector signed off on that assessment. No further treatment was recommended apart\nfrom AA. Certainly, Applicant\u2019s burden of showing reform would have been well served\nby a more recent favorable prognosis from a certified medical professional or a licensed\nclinical social worker, or had he testified that he was working the AA steps with his\nsponsor. His AA coins marking two years of sobriety demonstrate some commitment on\nhis part to AA and to remaining free of alcohol and illegal drugs, but given the decline in\nhis AA attendance of late, his failure to work the AA program with his sponsor, and the\nabsence of a recent prognosis from a qualified professional, I am unable to fully apply\nAG \u00b6 23(d). Alcohol consumption concerns are not sufficiently mitigated.\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nUnder AG \u00b6 24(a), drugs are defined as \u201cmood and behavior altering substances,\u201d\nand include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in\nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens),  and\n10\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances.\nUnder AG \u00b6 24(b), drug abuse is defined as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a\nlegal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d\n\nAccording to his e-QIP, Applicant was granted an \u201cL\u201d clearance for his work with the DOE in 1992.\n11\nIn his October 2008 affidavit, he indicated that he smoked small amounts of marijuana about once a week with\nfriends from 1978 or 1979 until 2000. (Ex. 11.) This time frame covers his emp[oyment with the DOE, so he\nmay have smoked marijuana while he held a DOE clearance. See AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being\ngranted a security clearance.\u201d\n12\nApplicant abused marijuana about once a week from 1978 or 1979 until 2000, and\nthree to four times per week thereafter until about August 2006, when he was arrested\nfor illegal possession. He apparently also had a marijuana pipe with residue on him when\nhe was arrested in May 2004, for which he was fined, before the offense was expunged.\nAG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia,\u201d are pertinent.\nThe regularity of his marijuana abuse over several years precludes favorable\nconsideration of AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is likely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Concerning\nwhether Applicant has demonstrated an intent to forego future drug abuse sufficient to\nsatisfy AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d there is\nlittle to no information in the available record about the friends with whom he used\nmarijuana, or how he obtained the marijuana that he smoked. For example, it is unclear\nwhether he smoked the marijuana at times alone in his home. His marijuana use\napparently continued after he was married, while he was working for the DOE,  and also\n11\nwhile he remained at home to care for his young children. It was not just confined to the\nfishing lifestyle, which he described as an extreme lifestyle given to \u201cmaybe binge\ndrinking and such.\u201d (Tr. 61.) He has not detailed efforts taken, if any, to change or avoid\nthe environments where he used drugs (see AG \u00b6 26(b), stating \u201cchanging or avoiding\nthe environment where drugs were used\u201d), although his affiliation with AA tends to\nindicate that he is not knowingly associating with drug-using associates and contacts\n(see AG \u00b6 26(b(1), stating \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts\u201d).\nWhen compared to his 27 years of marijuana involvement, his present three-plus years\nof abstinence falls short of \u201can appropriate period of abstinence\u201d under AG \u00b6 25(b)(3),\nespecially given his testimony about his use of Vicodin in October 2008.\n \nEven extensive drug abuse can be mitigated under AG \u00b6 26(d) by \u201csatisfactory\ncompletion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to\nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d Applicant denies that his alcohol\nrehabilitation treatment also included counseling for illegal drugs (Ex. 11.). Although AG\n\u00b6 26(d) does not strictly apply, insights gained into abusive behaviors, triggers, and high\nrisk situations involving alcohol could be beneficial in achieving sustained abstinence\ninvolving other mood-altering substances like marijuana. Applicant has not abused any\nillegal drug since he received alcohol treatment. Random drug screens taken during the\nalcohol treatment program were negative. Concerning his possible abuse of prescribed\nVicodin in October 2008 following a dental procedure, Applicant took more pills than he\nneeded to alleviate his pain (\u201cYou get prescribed 20 pills, you only need one or two, what\n\n13\ndo you do with the other 18?\u201d). He showed some insight into substance abuse risks, in\nthat he struggled with the decision, but it did not stop him from taking all of the pills\nprescribed, including when he no longer needed them for pain.  Applicant has not\nrelapsed into alcohol or drug abuse, but his work environment presents a risk of relapse\n(\u201cThey are all talking about partying all the time and drinking and partying and you\u2019re like\noh, this sounds fun.\u201d). (Tr. 128.) More time is required before I can safely conclude that\nhis substance abuse, alcohol and drugs, is safely in the past.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant deliberately falsified his e-QIP by not disclosing his treatment for alcohol\ndependency from February to May 2007 or his abuse of marijuana, which had been\nthree to four times per week until 2006. Applicant admitted that he did not list his illegal\ndrug involvement because it would negatively impact his employment with the defense\ncontractor. He did not disclose his alcohol treatment because he felt it was personal\ninformation, and his life was going in a different direction. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s disclosures of his alcohol treatment and his extensive marijuana\nabuse history during his interview in October 2008 are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a),\n\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d There is no indication that Applicant\nvolunteered the information up-front, before being questioned, even if his rectification five\nmonths after his e-QIP is considered timely. At his hearing, he maintained he felt\ncoerced into signing an affidavit that was \u201cfabricated.\u201d Yet when asked to detail his\nconcerns in that regard, Applicant responded that his drug use and alcohol consumption\nwere in reality \u201cmuch worse.\u201d Whether Applicant deliberately minimized the extent of his\nsubstance abuse in his affidavit, or provided approximations that are not completely\naccurate, doubts linger about whether he can be counted on to provide full and frank\ninformation to government inquiries without regard to his personal interests.\nAs noted under Guideline J, a knowing and willful false statement on a security\nclearance application can be punished as a felony offense. Applicant\u2019s intentional\nconcealment of his substance abuse is too serious and recent to be mitigated under\npersonal conduct AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or\n\n14\nthe behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d He shows little to no remorse for his false statements, so I also cannot\napply AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d Furthermore, his reform of the personal\nconduct concerns is undermined by his recent suspension at work following an issue\ninvolving his timecard. Assuming Applicant notified his supervisor in person that he was\nleaving work, he apparently did not follow his company\u2019s policies regarding the reporting\nof hours worked.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern for finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant had some delinquent accounts placed for collection that he settled in or\nbefore 2006. As of June 2009, Applicant owed about $125,529 in delinquent medical\ndebt from a medical emergency in October 2006. He did not intend to repay the debt\nbecause he considered the treatment costs exorbitant. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d are pertinent to an evaluation of his security eligibility.\nOf the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies in\nthat the debts alleged in the SOR were the result of a serious medical problem that\nrequired immediate treatment when Applicant did not have insurance. But Applicant has\nnot acted responsibly under the circumstances. Understandably, with his hourly pay at\n$18.60, he is unable to resolve the $120,766 hospital debt in the reasonably foreseeable\nfuture without a bankruptcy or the creditor agreeing to settle for a significantly lesser\namount. But neither his financial situation or his personal disagreement with the cost of\nthe medical services excuses his failure to make reasonable attempts to reach some\naccommodation with his creditors. He has not contacted his creditors about resolving his\nmedical debt since about late 2006, including those debts of only $58, $87, and $29 that\nhe could afford to repay. He owes another $240 for two medical debts not related to his\ntreatment in October 2006 that he \u201cneglected to pay.\u201d (Tr. 74.) Although these two debts\nwere not alleged in the SOR, one has to question Applicant\u2019s financial judgment in not\nsatisfying these obligations when he knew the Government was concerned about his\n\n15\nfinancial situation. His disregard of repayment obligations that he considers exorbitant is\nincompatible with holding a security clearance. The Government must be assured that\nthose persons granted access can be relied on to comply with their legitimate\nobligations. His satisfaction of two medical debts of $34 and $298 in June 2007 is\nconsidered a self-initiated \u201cgood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d of the type contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(d), but this mitigating condition\ndoes not apply to most of his delinquent debt. Nor is his satisfaction of these two minor\ndebts sufficient to mitigate the financial concerns under AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and\nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant displayed poor judgment in several different aspects over the last 30\nyears. He physically assaulted a former girlfriend, used marijuana for many years in\ndisregard of its illegality, drank alcohol to the point where he developed a serious alcohol\nproblem, lied on a security clearance application to protect his employment prospects\nwith a defense contractor, and continues to ignore debt obligations that were not incurred\nvoluntarily, but benefitted him. Following his arrest for illegal marijuana possession in\nAugust 2006, he was referred to an alcohol treatment program that led him to a\ncessation of his abusive drinking and his drug involvement. But his admission to taking\nVicodin when he did not need it for pain in October 2008 is troubling, especially when he\nadmits he has been lax in his commitment to AA of late. His intentional falsification of his\nsecurity clearance application and his knowing disregard of his delinquent debts continue\nto raise concerns about his overall judgment and reliability. Based on the record, I am\nunable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\na security clearance at this time.\n\n16\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 5, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 5.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 5.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 5.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 5.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 5.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 5.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 5.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 5.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 5.i:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n17\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings are in error; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the pertinent mitigating conditions is in\nerror; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a systems engineer for a defense contractor.  He worked\npreviously for another contractor.  The gravamen of the security concerns in Applicant\u2019s case is his\nrelationship with a woman (W), a national of a foreign country (FC).\nIn the early 2000s, Applicant\u2019s employer sent him on temporary duty (TDY) to a third\ncountry, where he met W.  They developed a friendship.  She returned to FC toward the end of the\nTDY and, after he returned to the U.S., Applicant sent her $400.  When he informed his security\noffice about the friendship, he was told not to have further contact with her or send her additional\nmoney.  Decision at 3.  Applicant subsequently sent her monetary payments totaling $10,000.  His\nsecurity office again directed him to have no further contact with W.  \nDespite his employer\u2019s warning, Applicant saw W again.  Over the course of time, they\ndeveloped a sexual relationship.  Applicant was often dilatory in reporting his contacts with her.\nAlthough W married a member of the U.S. military, she and Applicant had a child together.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct with W resulted in revocation of his access to Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation.  W currently lives near Applicant in the U.S., and he sees her three to four times a\nweek, providing her approximately $2,700 a month in support. \nThe Judge noted aspects of the case that were favorable to Applicant, for example the fact\nthat much of the adverse information came from Applicant\u2019s own self-reporting.  However, the\nJudge also noted that this reporting was often delayed and that Applicant continued the relationship\nwith W after being told to terminate it.  The Judge concluded that, because Applicant continues to\nsee W in visiting with his child, the stressors which resulted in the relationship are still present.\nAccordingly, he concluded that Applicant cannot, under the circumstances, be found to have\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his relationship with W.    \nApplicant challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  However, after reviewing the\nrecord, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\n\n3\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)  Even if the Judge\u2019s findings contain errors, they are not such\nas would have affected the outcome of the case.  \nViewed in light of the record as a whole, the decision expresses \u201ca \u2018rational connection\nbetween the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v.\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this\nrecord.  Decision at 13.  See also Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

After a thorough review of \nthe record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old senior systems engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since June 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nApplicant first received a clearance in 1986. (Tr. 63, 103) In April 2009, Applicant was \npromoted to supervisor. (Ex. E) Applicant took on more and more work responsibility \nand was favorably received by his company\u2019s customers. Applicant\u2019s supervisor is very \npleased with Applicant\u2019s professionalism. (Ex. F) \n \nApplicant had an affair with a woman, which he acknowledges \u201cin and of itself is \na dishonest act, a deceitful act.\u201d (Tr. 23) Applicant fell in love with the woman and he \nhad a difficult time breaking off his ties with her. He describes their relationship as a six-\nyear nightmare, which would have ended if they did not have a child together. (Tr. 24) \nHe acknowledged he violated ethical rules and moral values during the relationship, a \nrelationship that has cost him close friends. (Tr. 24, 25)  \n \nHis wife, daughters, parents, mother-in-law, and pastor are aware of the details. \n(Tr. 102) It was a year after the sexual affair started in 2005, before he told his wife. It \nwas not until this year, that Applicant has been able to talk to his children about the \nmatter. (Tr. 26)  \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                          \n \nIn May 2003, Applicant\u2019s company sent him to Korea for temporary duty (TDY). \nWhile there, he met a Kyrgyzstani female from Kyrgyzstan who was working at a bar2 \noutside the military base where he was TDY.  \n \n \nDuring the first three weeks of this four-week TDY in-country, Applicant spent his \nfree time at the bar talking with the Kyrgyzstani woman. Although he was married at the \ntime, Applicant and the woman became close. They talked about contrasting world \nviews, politics, faith, and other topics. (Tr. 48) They had lunches and dinners together a \nfew times. (Tr. 49) Nothing sexual occurred. A week before Applicant\u2019s TDY ended, the \nwoman returned to Kyrgyzstan. Under her contract with the bar, she worked 11 months \nand was entitled to a one month vacation. The woman had a sick father, a mother, and \nher 2-year-old son born in 2000, living in Kyrgyzstan. When Applicant returned to the \nU.S., at the conclusion of his TDY, he sent the woman $400. At the time, Applicant was \nsimply trying to assist someone he just met. The relation was merely platonic. It was \nonly later that he fell in love with her. (Ex. 4)  \n \n \n \nHis first day back at work, Applicant informed his security office he had met the \nwoman and sent her money. Security told him to have no further contact with the \nwoman and not to send any additional money until security got back with him. (Tr. 51, \n60, Ex. 4, page 5 of 8) Weeks passed with no additional contact from the security office. \nApplicant received many, many calls from the woman that he did not answer. (Tr. 51) In \nJuly 2003, he answered a call from her and resumed his contact with the woman. She \nwas upset that he had not answered her calls and had not contacted her. (Tr. 52)  \n \n \nApplicant learned the woman was going to return to Korea. Applicant provided \nthe woman sufficient funds, $2,000 to $3,000, to buy out her contract with the bar. (Tr. \n52, 62) In January 2004, Applicant reported to security officials that between July 2003 \nand December 2003, Applicant sent her approximately $10,000. She used part of the \nmoney to purchase an apartment in Kyrgyzstan for her parents and son to live in. (Tr. \n62) In the fall of 2003, Applicant had a strong desire to visit the woman. In January \n2004, he informed the government of the money transfers and requested permission to \nvisit the woman. Applicant was again directed to have no further contact with the \nwoman and to stop sending her money. His travel request was denied. \n \nApplicant was given an appropriate amount of time to end the relationship. (Tr. \n55, 65) Applicant stopped sending money, but continued making telephone calls. It was \ninitially suggested or recommended that he change his telephone number. He was later \ntold he could keep his cell phone number. (Tr. 71) In May 2006, he did change his \nnumber. (Tr. 73) \n \n \n2 At some point, his security officials gave Applicant a copy of an article from the Army Times about \nwomen working in Korean bars who would obtain or extort money from military members and contractors \nand provide it to the bar owners. (Tr. 60) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIn February 2004, Applicant was going to fly to Kyrgyzstan to see the woman. \nThe purpose of the trip was to visit her to determine if his feelings for her were valid. (Tr. \n64) He knew his foreign travel request had been disapproved, but he still went to the \nairport and went through security. However, he did not get on the plane. (Tr. 69) \nApplicant understood if he traveled to her his career would be ended. (Tr. 53) He \nthought if got on the plane there was a 99.9 percent chance his career would be over. \n(Tr. 70) \n \nIn March 2004, Applicant underwent a psychiatric evaluation showing no \npsychotic disorder, but that he was going through a deeply personal and emotional \nsituation. (Ex. 4, page 6 of 8) At that time, marriage counseling was recommended. \nApplicant moved on with his life. As of April 2004, all contact between the two had \nended. (Tr. 55) Applicant had no contact with the woman until he accidently met her a \nyear later, in March 2005. (Tr. 36) \n \nIn May or June 2004, Applicant purchased a new home. After closing on the \nhouse, he discovered his wife was pregnant with their third child who was born in \nJanuary 2005. (Tr. 36, Ex. 4, page 5 of 8) During this time, Applicant turned down a job \noffer in Denver, because he had just purchased a new home and he did not want to \nmove or move his family. (Tr. 73) Applicant had just \u201cgone through a year of hell over \nthis, and I felt like my life was finally getting back on track.\u201d (Tr. 73) At this time, he was \nunconcerned whether the woman called or not.  \n \nAlthough Applicant was unaware of it, the woman had returned to Korea on a \nvisitor\u2019s visa and started working in the same bar as before. While working there, she \nmet someone new. In June 2004, a USAF master sergeant (E-7) made application to \nmarry the woman and in August 2004, they married. (Tr. 56, Ex. B) \n \nFrom April 2004 through March 2005, Applicant\u2019s foreign travel was restricted. \nHe was authorized to travel to Korea on mission-related business. (Tr. 37) In March \n2005, Applicant was again TDY to Korea. While there, he unexpectedly met the woman, \nwho was again working at the same bar. Up to that point, Applicant had no idea where \nthe woman was or what she was doing. He was surprised at seeing her, because the \nlast he knew he had helped her end her bar employment contract and she had returned \nto Kyrgyzstan.  \n \nApplicant knew his running into the woman would be of concern to his employer. \n(Tr. 75) Applicant and the woman discussed the fact that they had moved on with their \nlives. The woman told him she had married an active duty enlisted member and her son \nwas living with her in Korea. Applicant met the woman\u2019s son. The woman initially had \nhoped Applicant would return and marry her. (Ex. 4, page 5 of 8) They were still in love \nwith each other, but Applicant had no intention of continuing a relationship with her. (Tr. \n39) \n \nFollowing his TDY, Applicant returned to the U.S. and reported seeing the \nwoman to his security office. (Tr. 38) A restriction was placed on his travel permissions. \n\n \n5 \n \n(Tr. 39) He was to return to Korea in August for additional temporary duty. In August \n2005, the woman would not be in Korea because she was scheduled to accompany her \nhusband to his new assignment. Late in May 2005, Applicant had a meeting with the \nsecurity officials about his August trip. During that meeting, Applicant informed the \nsecurity officials the woman was living with him in the U.S. and the relationship was not \ngoing to end. (Tr. 40) On June 1, 2005, his accesses were suspended pending further \ninvestigation. (Tr. 40, 66)  \n \nApplicant had discussed obtaining a waiver from the security officials. He was \ninformed it would take at least one year to process because it involved an adulterous \nrelationship. (Tr. 65) He was told he would have to be separated from his wife before \nthe waiver was considered. (Tr. 65) In May 2005, he asked that the waiver be \nprocessed because he had separated from his wife and was living with the woman. (Tr. \n66) Applicant submitted a group of documents, more than one inch thick, to security \nsupporting his waiver request. (Tr. 123) Applicant was separated from his wife from May \n2005 through October 2005. (Tr. 81) It was not until January 2006, that he learned the \nwaiver would not be granted. (Tr. 68) \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant was again away from home performing temporary duty in \nthe U.S. For seven days the woman came to CONUS because of visa issues. Her \nhusband was being transferred from Korea to Iceland and she needed to get her \nKyrgyzstani visa in order. She flew to Applicant\u2019s location and they spent the period of \nhis TDY and several days before and after the TDY together. (Tr. 80) The woman \nreturned to Hawaii to be with her husband while transiting to Iceland. This was the first \ntime Applicant and the woman had sexual relations. (Tr. 85) During this time, the \nwoman became pregnant. All were unsure if the father was the woman\u2019s husband or the \nApplicant.  \n \nWhen the woman returned to Hawaii, Applicant believed the affair was over, \nthere would be no relationship and she would shortly be living in Iceland. He thought he \nwould never see her again. (Try, 121) \n \nAt the end of May 2005, the woman returned to CONUS and again lived with \nApplicant. The following day, Applicant reported to his security office that he was again \nliving with the Kyrgyzstani woman. (Tr. 82) Applicant provided information that he knew \nwas detrimental to him professionally as well as personally in his marriage and in his \nrelationship with coworkers. (Tr. 24) \n \nThere were problems with her visa. Her husband wanted her to stay in Hawaii \nwhile the problems were fixed, she wanted to stay with friends in the U.S. (Tr. 121) \nInstead of staying with friends, the woman lived with Applicant until July 2005, when she \nreceived approval of her visa and left for Iceland to be with her husband. (Tr. 82) The \nwoman got on the plane to Iceland and the affair was over. A week later, he told \nsecurity she had left and the relationship was over. (Tr. 123)  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe woman said she was going to Iceland to set the record straight with her \nhusband and would be back. (Tr. 83) Applicant was uncertain if the woman would be \nreturning, but did lease an apartment for her and her son in the local area. (Tr. 84) The \nrecord fails to indicate how long he maintained the apartment. From September 2005 \nthrough December 2005, he was working temporarily in Denver. (Tr. 83) After some \ntime, her husband was transferred to England and then to an Air Force base on the \nwest coast of the U.S.  \n \nIn January 2006, Applicant met with security officials and disclosed what had \noccurred. In March 2006, Applicant\u2019s access to Sensitive Compartmented Information \n(SCI) was revoked. Applicant appealed the decision. (Tr. 42) In February 2007, that \nrevocation was upheld. In March 2006, Applicant informed his wife of the affair and that \nhis SCI access had been revoked. He also told her of the pregnancy. (Tr. 88) They \nstarted marriage counseling, which ended in November 2006. (Tr. 42, Ex. 5, page 4 of \n6)  \n \nDuring her pregnancy, Applicant sent the woman $300. (Tr. 43) Following the \nbirth of the child in February 2006, Applicant began a $750 direct deposit for child \nsupport to the woman\u2019s account. (Tr. 90, 132) Applicant had sent the woman a state \nAffidavit of Paternity and asked her to sign it. (Tr. 44) The woman refused to sign so \nlong as Applicant remained with his wife and children. Having been denied paternity of \nhis daughter, Applicant was upset with the woman and wanted to get on with his life. \n(Tr. 74) They both agreed their relationship was over, and for the good of the child, for \nboth of them, and their families, it was best to terminate the relationship. (Tr. 44)  \n \nOn May 3, 2006, contact stopped and there was no contact for a year. (Tr. 44, \nEx. 4, page 6 of 8) Applicant did not respond to a September 2006 email from the \nwoman. In May 2008, Applicant completed a sworn affidavit. (Ex. 5) At that time, \nApplicant was no longer in contact with the woman and did not know where she lived. \nThe last he knew, she was still in Iceland.  \n \n In March 2008, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended because another \ngovernment agency had revoked his SCI access. (Ex. 6) In June 2008, Applicant was \ncontacted by the woman and several weeks later she asked if he wanted to see his \ndaughter. Applicant was unsure if the woman was separated, divorced, or living with her \nhusband. In August 2008, they resumed communications. Applicant\u2019s wife was aware \nApplicant was communicating with the woman. (Tr. 45)  \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant completed an affidavit of parentage listing himself \nas the father of the child. (Ex. 4, page 2 of 8) A name change request for the child has \nbeen submitted to the state court. (Tr. 45) Applicant is taking full responsibility and \nfinancially responsibility for his daughter. (Tr. 46) His daughter is covered by his \ninsurance. He is actively seeking to contact the Iceland Registry Bureau so that his \nname properly appears on the US Report of Foreign Birth. When the documents are in \norder, his daughter\u2019s name will reflect his last name. (Ex. E)  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAlso in September 2008, he started six months of weekly counseling talking \nabout his wife, his children, and the other woman. (T. 141) He was trying to resolve his \nfeelings. Applicant and his wife also resumed marriage counseling and seeing a clinical \npsychologist. (Ex. B) In March 2009, Applicant stopped attending marital counseling \nwhen the woman moved to his location. (Tr. 46) Also in March 2009, Applicant and his \nwife shared with their children information about all the events occurring since May \n2003. His wife and children have shared that information with their closest friends. (Ex. \n3) His relationship with his children, ages 4, 15, and 20, is on the mend. (Tr. 93)  \n \nIn a March 2009 letter (Ex. 3), Applicant said he was contemplating divorcing his \nwife. His wife has agreed that should the woman be forced to return to Kyrgyzstan, the \ndaughter could remain with them in the U.S. (Tr. 97) Applicant sees his future with his \nwife. (Tr. 144) Applicant and his wife have known each other since he was 5 years old. \nThey started dating when he was a high school freshman and they became serious as \nhigh school seniors. (Tr. 142) \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant went to the west coast to see his daughter on her \nthird birthday. (Tr. 132) Also in February 2009, the woman completed a medical \nassistant course. (Ex. 3) In March 2009, the woman separated from her husband and \nmoved to Applicant\u2019s location and has since filed for divorce. (Tr. 97) Applicant asked \nher not move to his location, but she came anyway. Applicant leased a home for her \nand her children. (Tr. 45, 91, Ex. 3) He pays $2,050 per month rent, the utilities, \ntelephone bill, internet bill, and for groceries. (Tr. 45, 92) All together he pays \napproximately $2,700 per month for the care of the woman and her children. Applicant\u2019s \nwife knows he is providing this support to the woman and her family. (Tr. 92) Since \nMarch 2009, Applicant sees his daughter and the woman three or four times a week. \n(Tr. 143)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \n\n \n9 \n \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; \n \n\n \n10 \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \nStarting in 2003, when Applicant was 36 years old, he engaged in questionable \nconduct and judgment, and failed to comply with security rules and regulations which \nraised questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. In June 2003, Applicant was told by security officials to cease his contact \nwith the woman and stop sending her money. For a time, Applicant complied, but then \nresumed his contact. This pattern would repeat itself over the next six years. Between \nJuly and December 2003, he sent her $10,000 and currently provides her support of \n$2,700 per month. He currently sees her three times a week. His contact with her \nrelates primarily to their three-year-old daughter. \n \nIn February 2004, Applicant was going to fly to see the woman to validate his \nfeelings for her. His foreign travel request had been disapproved and he was again told \nto cease contact with the woman. Contacted ended for a while. In June 2004, the \nwoman married an Air Force master sergeant. In March 2005, they unexpectedly met in \nKorea. During May 2005 through early July 2005, they lived together in the U.S. In July \n2005, she accompanied her husband on his PCS to Iceland. In January 2006, he told \nsecurity what had occurred and his SCI was revoked. He acknowledged he delayed \nreporting facts to security. To his credit, he did eventually report the information, which \nhe knew would be detrimental. In February 2006, Applicant started sending the woman \n$750 per month following the birth of their daughter.  \n \nIn May 2006, contact ended. In March 2008, Applicant\u2019s security clearance is \nsuspended. In May 2008, contact with the woman resumes. In March 2009, Applicant \ncontemplated divorce; the woman separated from her husband, and moved into a \nresidence at the Applicant\u2019s location paid for by Applicant.  \n \nApplicant realizes his conduct was inappropriate. He was fully aware of the \ngovernment\u2019s concerns. He stated he knew if he got on the plane in February 2004, he \nwould have no job when he returned. He acknowledged the affair was a dishonest act, a \ndeceitful act, and acknowledged he violated ethical rules and moral values during the \nrelationship. He describes his relationship with the woman as a six-year nightmare, \nwhich would have ended if they did not have a child together. His judgment and \nreliability are questionable.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \n\n \n11 \n \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nMuch of the adverse information was supplied by Applicant. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not \napply because he often delayed reporting the information and then failed to follow what \nhe was told by the security officers. AG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply because there was no \nimproper or inadequate advice leading to the conduct. Applicant has held a clearance \nsince 1986 and knew the ramifications of his actions. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because the conduct was not minor. Applicant met the \nwoman six years ago, but continues to see her and his daughter. Since Applicant and \nthe woman have a daughter, their contact with one another is likely to continue. The \nconduct casts doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nEven though Applicant has received marriage counseling, AG \u00b6 17(d) does not \napply because the counseling has not changed the behavior. Additionally, there have \nbeen no positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior. The conduct is likely to \ncontinue. AG \u00b6 17(e) only partially applies because Applicant has revealed the affair \nand his daughter\u2019s existence to his security officials, his wife, children, parents, pastor, \nand mother-in-law, which reduces or eliminates vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (f) does not apply because the information was substantiated and AG \u00b6 \n17 (g) does not apply because Applicant was not associated with persons involved in \ncriminal activity.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 42 years old, sufficiently \nmature to understand the inappropriateness of his conduct. He understood the security \nramifications of his actions. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his \npersonal conduct. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. For six years, Applicant has been involved in an on-again off-\nagain relationship with this woman. He has contemplated divorce, but is staying with his \nwife. However, the woman and his daughter live a short distance away.  \n \nUnder Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not recommended. At \nsome future time, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security \nworthiness.  \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n________________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness\nconcerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated January, 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn May 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and he admitted the factual\nallegations under the financial guideline. He requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request and the case to me on July 28, 2009.\nApplicant and Department Counsel agreed to a September 10, 2009, hearing date. On\nAugust 14, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for that date.\nOctober 30, 2009\n\n2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel introduced eight\nexhibits (GE) 1-8, without objection. Applicant introduced five exhibits (AE) A-F, without\nobjection. He testified on his own behalf. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nSeptember 18, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for a public trust position is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school and received an Associate of Science Degree from a technical college in\n1977. He continues to attend college courses and is working on his undergraduate\ndegree (Tr. 45). He is divorced and has one son. He has worked for his current\nemployer since February 2008 (Tr. 29).\nBefore his current employment, Applicant worked in the technology field. In\n2001, his steady employment ended (Tr. 23). He was earning approximately $60,000\nannually. He had difficulty finding permanent professional employment, and he worked\nin various temporary lower paying positions. His marriage ended in divorce in July 2001,\nwhich added to his financial difficulties (AE B). His salary was approximately halved to\n$30,000 when he found a full-time position in 2003. In 2003, his father was diagnosed\nwith cancer. Applicant relocated to his father\u2019s home to care for him. He lost\nemployment opportunities when he decided to care for his father. \nIn 2006, Applicant began a full-time position that paid well. The contract for his\njob ended in 2007, and Applicant faced unemployment for almost one year (Tr. 27).\nApplicant did not have health insurance due to unemployment. He incurred medical\nbills. He had surgery for a cornea transplant and he had another operation that was\nnecessary. He depleted his savings and eventually lost his home. He could not maintain\nhis payments on his accounts.\nAt issue are the following debts totaling approximately $48,000 as noted in the\nMarch 27, 2009 SOR as allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p.\n1.a Judgment ($1,163) UNPAID Applicant admits this represents unpaid rent for an\napartment lease.\n1.b Medical ($515) UNPAID Applicant did not recall the account, but believes it\noccurred during his unemployment. He admits the debt.\n1.c Medical ($256) UNPAID Applicant admits this allegation.  \n1.d Collection ($2,325) UNPAID Applicant believes this may be a duplicate of the\nalleged debt in 1.a. He has not researched the debt but included it in his repayment\nschedule.\n1.e Collection ($150) UNPAID Applicant denies this account.\n\n3\n1.f Phone ($1,268) UNPAID Applicant admits this allegation and stopped paying during\nhis period of unemployment.\n1.g Collection ($1,093) UNPAID Applicant admits this allegation represents a credit\ncard account.\n1.h Auto ($9,800) UNPAID Applicant admits the car was repossessed. He stopped\nmaking payments when he was unemployed. He did not research the account.\n1.j Child Support ($4,434) Applicant denies the amount. He produced documentation\nthat he has $18 in arrears as of September 2009.\n1.k Collection ($2,644) UNPAID Applicant acknowledges this represents a credit card\nthat had a balance of approximately $500, but with interest and penalties it has\nincreased to the current amount (Tr. 53).\n1.l Auto ($20,316) UNPAID Applicant admits this is another vehicle repossession in\napproximately 2003. \n1.m Medical ($2,795) UNPAID Applicant admits this allegation, but did not explain the\nreason for the account.\n1.n Medical ($490) UNPAID Applicant admits this allegation, but did not explain the\nreason for the account.\n1.o Medical ($243) UNPAID Applicant admits this allegation. This represents the\nsurgery for the cornea transplant.\n1.p Collection ($136) UNPAID Applicant admits this allegation for a cable bill that was\nnot paid.\nApplicant obtained the services of a consumer credit counseling service in 2008\n(AE D). Before 2008, he researched various debt management companies and\ndetermined that it was not in his best interests to use them (GE 6). He has a repayment\nplan (AE C). The debts alleged in the SOR are on the repayment plan. He has not\nstarted making payments. He did not want to commit to making payments if he does not\nreceive a clearance and then does not retain his current job. He also explained that his\nson has sports expenses that Applicant pays (Tr. 57). His current salary is $65,000 (Tr.\n61). He estimates a net monthly remainder of $500. He is current on his monthly\nexpenses, including his $400 car payment (Tr. 63). He rents a room and lives in a frugal\nfashion. He pays $229 a month for child support (Tr. 42).\nApplicant acknowledged responsibility for his delinquent debts. He does not\ndispute them. He paid two judgments for motor vehicle fines to the municipal courts in\nJuly 2009. The fines dated back to 2004 (AE F). He was in arrears in child support\npayments but as of September 2009, his arrearage was $18 (AE E).\n\n4\nIn response to the DOHA 2008 interrogatories, Applicant noted various accounts\nthat would be paid in full in January 2009. He submitted his repayment plan. However,\nhe has not followed the plan. He noted that his wages were garnished for the child\nsupport arrearage.\nApplicant\u2019s employer recommends him for a public trust position. Applicant\ndemonstrates diligence in his job duties and provides technical knowledge that has\nbeen indispensable to the company.\nApplicant\u2019s previous supervisor recommends Applicant for a public trust position.\nHe described Applicant as detail-oriented, pleasant, honest, and competent (AE A). His\nsupervisor considers him one of the most trustworthy team managers. His management\nand communication skills are excellent. Applicant is responsible for large expenditures\nin his work.\nApplicant\u2019s colleagues report he is a dependable team player. He is mature,\nlogical, practical, and responsible. He is an asset to the organization. He is ambitious\nand is a leader. Applicant deal with sensitive contract issues in an efficient and\nprofessional manner (AE A). \nApplicant is active in his son\u2019s life. He is a loving and devoted father. He\npresented 12 letters of recommendation from friends and colleagues.\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\n\n6\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt from 2001 until the\npresent. He acknowledged the accounts represented old debt for approximately\n$48,000, including two vehicle repossessions. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\ndisqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Most of Applicant=s debts became delinquent around the time of his first\nunemployment in 2001. He suffered further unemployment in 2007, and had lower\npaying jobs until his current position. However, he was unwilling to pay his debts after\nhe became employed. Consequently, this mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Inasmuch as the\nmajority of debts at issue became delinquent during Applicant\u2019s periods of\nunemployment and divorce, this was beyond his control. However, he has not acted\nresponsibly by waiting to pay the delinquent debts. He does not want to pay the older\ndebts in case he is not eligible for a position of public trust and loses his job. Some of\nthe delinquent debts are small and could have been paid. This mitigating condition does\nnot apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received formal financial\ncounseling. He obtained the services of a credit consolidator. He has a repayment plan\nthat includes the debts listed in the SOR. However, he has not started the repayment\nplan. He paid two judgments that were the result of fines in 2004. He does not have a\nsignificant child support arrearage. He is conditioning his repayments on obtaining a\nposition of public trust. Therefore, AG & 20(d), Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,@ does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n7\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nhas worked in a professional capacity his entire career. He is recommended for a\nposition of trust by his supervisors and colleagues. He is a devoted family man.\nApplicant\u2019s debts started when he became unemployed in 2001. He experienced lower-\npaying jobs for several years. He found himself unemployed again in 2007. His\nmarriage ended in divorce in 2001. He takes responsibility for the debts.\nThe debts appeared on his credit report for a number of years. In February 2008,\nhe obtained a position that pays a greater sum of money. He is doing well in his job. He\nobtained the services of a debt consolidation company in December 2008. He has\nincluded all the debts that are listed on the SOR. However, he is waiting to start the\nrepayment plan. He wants to be certain that he receives a position of public trust and\ndoes not lose his job.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts with regard to\nApplicant\u2019s financial condition. As noted above, AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will be\nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d Consequently, I conclude Applicant has not met\nhis burden and has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his\nfinances. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a:-1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n_____________________________\nNOREEN A LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guidelines \nH, Drug Involvement, J, Criminal Conduct, and E, Personal Conduct. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines H, J, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 8, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 16, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on the same day. I convened the hearing as \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 15, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nscheduled on December 2, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified and \noffered Exhibits (AE) A through C. They were admitted into evidence without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 9, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to correctly note that the \nallegations under Guideline E should be numbered paragraph 3 instead of 2, which \nincluded the allegations under Guideline J. There were no objections and the motion \nand amendment were granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 62 years old. He graduated from high school and attended college \nfor four years, but did not earn a degree. He served in the Army for two years and was \nhonorably discharged. He has never been married and has no children. He is an \ninformation assurance analyst for a federal contractor.1  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 1970 to 2007. He used \ncocaine, with varying frequency, from about 1970 until about October 1996. He used \nheroin, with varying frequency from about 1970 to 2002. He admitted he was addicted \nto drugs in the 1970s and 1980s. He used hypodermic needles up until 1985, when he \nstopped due to the AIDS epidemic. He then used heroin nasally. He admitted he was \naddicted to heroin.2  \n \n \nIn 1998, Applicant moved to a new state and stated he remained drug-free for six \nyears. He attended Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous. In 2002, \nwhen he lost his job due to an economic downturn, he moved back to his former area of \nresidence, and relapsed by using heroin on two occasions. He stated he had urges to \nuse \u201copiates.\u201d He went to the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital and sought treatment. \nHe entered a detoxification and substance abuse program. He explained he got \nprogressively better in the program. He attended daily group counseling. He got a job in \n2004. He took methadone on a daily basis from June 2002 to February 2005, and \nstayed in the program until 2006. Applicant moved to his current area of residence in \n2006, and while attending a party in September 2007, he used marijuana.3  \n \n1 Tr. 85-90. \n \n2 Tr. 23-33, 44-48, 54. \n \n3 Tr. 29-33, 44-48, 61-63, 84-85. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant admits the criminal conduct alleged in the SOR with some minor \nvariances. From 1971 through 1997, he was arrested 16 times. He believes he served a \ncumulative total of approximately four years in jail for various offenses. Some of the \ncharges were dismissed or he pled guilty to lesser offenses. The charges included: \npossession of dangerous drugs, petit larceny, possession of stolen property, possession \nof a hypodermic, person not entitled to sign name of another to credit card, fraud, \nfraudulent use of credit card, possession of forged instrument, criminal possession of \nstolen property, unlawful use of credit cards, criminal possession of stolen credit cards, \ngrand larceny, false application to bank, failure to appear, obstruction of government \nadministration, possession controlled substance, forgery-deed, will, codicil, forgery, \ncriminal possession of forged instruments, and attempted criminal possession of \ncontrolled substance. In some instances, Applicant was charged on different dates with \nthe same charges as noted above.4  \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of the following offenses: person not entitled to sign \nname of another to credit card, sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended; fraud and \nfraudulent use of credit card, sentenced to five years in jail, suspended; petit larceny, \nsentenced to four months in jail and fined; possession of stolen property, sentenced to \nconditional discharge; false statements, sentenced to probation; obstruction of \ngovernment administration, sentenced to 30 days in jail and fine; petit larceny, \nsentenced to 60 days in jail and fine; felony forgery-deed, will codicil, sentenced to one \nyear in prison; criminal possession forged instrument, felony, sentenced to one to three \nyears in correctional facility; attempted forgery 2nd degree, sentenced to 18 months to \nthree years in prison; petit larceny, sentenced to six months in prison; attempted \ncriminal possession of controlled substance, criminal solicitation, sentenced to \nconditional discharge; and obstructing government administration, fined.5  \n \n \nThe government conceded that Applicant provided sufficient information in his e-\nQIP to put it on notice regarding his arrests, criminal convictions, and bankruptcy \npetition. Applicant admitted that he had many arrests and convictions, but had difficulty \nremembering all of the dates, charges, and sentences. Specifically, the government \nconcedes the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.c, and 3.d. I find for Applicant on those \nallegations. \n \n \nOn February 19, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigative Processing (e-QIP). In response to question 24a, he failed to disclose he \nillegally used heroin and marijuana, in 2002 and 2007, respectively. Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation for failing to disclose his heroin use in 2002 was that shortly after he used \nheroin, he participated in a VA substance abuse program and he was prescribed \nmethadone. He stated he did not believe his 2002 heroin use was relevant or within the \nscope of the question. He also stated he did not think the heroin use was an issue \nbecause he had been in a drug program, so he decided not to divulge it. He first stated \n \n4 Tr. 23-27, 68-78. \n \n5 Tr. 68-78; GE 5. The convictions are presented in chronological order from 1971 through 1997. The \nsame charges are repeated where Applicant was arrested on a different occasion.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nhe did not know why he did not divulge his 2007 marijuana use. He admitted he knew \nusing marijuana was illegal. He admitted he did not want to disclose his marijuana use \non his e-QIP because he did not want anyone to know about it. When he was \ninterviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, in May 2008, he \nwas asked about his past drug use. He told the investigator that his last drug use was in \n1997. He intentionally and deliberately concealed the 2002 heroin use and 2007 \nmarijuana use. He now realizes he should have divulged it. Applicant intentionally and \ndeliberately falsified his e-QIP and provided false information during his OPM interview, \nboth are felonies in violation of 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 1001.6  \n \n \nApplicant explained that many of his criminal offenses involved stealing people\u2019s \ncredit cards and forging signatures to obtain money for drugs. He would steal wallets \nfrom store dressing rooms and buy gift certificates and make a small purchase so he \nwould then receive the remaining amount of the gift certificate in cash. He would also \nsteal cash from the wallet, if there was any.  \n \n \nNo one at his place of work, other than his facility security officer, is aware of his \ndrug or criminal history. Outside of work, only his mother is aware of his past drug and \ncriminal history. His father is deceased.7  \n \n \nApplicant attends a recovery support group through his church once a week for \ntwo hours. He has been attending since February 2008.8 \n \n \nApplicant provided certificates of course completions. He provided a copy of his \nperformance appraisal which shows a grade of 3.10 on a 5.0 scale. I have considered \nall of the information provided by Applicant.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n \n6 Tr. 34-43, 56-58, 62-67;GE 1. \n \n7 Tr. 58-60. \n \n8 Tr. 78-79. \n \n9 AE A, B and C. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Drugs are \ndefined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) \n\n \n6 \n \n \ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program as prescribed \nby a duly qualified medical professional; and  \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nAppellant has an extensive drug abuse history. He attended drug treatment, but \nrelapsed when he used heroin in 2002, and again when he used marijuana in 2007. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was diagnosed by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional, or licensed clinical social worker, or that a drug treatment program was \nprescribed to him by a qualified medical professional. Therefore, disqualifying conditions \n(d), (e), and (f) cannot be applied. There is sufficient evidence of Applicant\u2019s drug \nabuse, possession of illegal drugs, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Therefore, I \nfind disqualifying conditions (a) and (b) apply. There is sufficient evidence to show \nApplicant\u2019s failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use. Applicant \ncompleted an extensive drug treatment program, discontinued using illegal drugs for a \nperiod of time, and then relapsed by using heroin in 2002 and most recently in 2007, by \nusing marijuana. I find disqualifying condition (h) applies.  \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 \n26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened \nunder circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \n\n \n7 \n \n \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant has a 37-year-history of drug abuse. His most recent use was in 2007, \nafter completion of an extensive drug treatment program. Based on Applicant\u2019s past \nhistory of abuse and relapses, and his most recent use, I cannot find that it is unlikely \nApplicant will abuse illegal drugs again. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \nApplicant used marijuana with friends while at a party, after he completed a methadone \nprogram. I cannot find that he has demonstrated an intent not to use drugs in the future \nor that he has disassociated himself from those that do use drugs. I find mitigating \ncondition (b) does not apply. Although Applicant completed a drug treatment program, \nthe evidence supports that he had a relapse after the program. No prognosis from a \nduly qualified medical professional was provided. Therefore, I find mitigating condition \n(d) does not apply. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offense; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nAppellant has an extensive criminal history, including numerous felony and \nmisdemeanor convictions. Cumulatively, he has served approximately four years in jail. \nI find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement.  \n \n \nAppellant has an extensive criminal record involving drug offenses, theft, fraud, \nand forgery. Most of his criminal conduct was prior to 1997. Many of the offenses were \nrelated to his drug abuse and many of the offenses committed were crimes of \ndeception. Although he has attempted to put his life on track, he continued to violate the \nlaw by using drugs, as recently as 2007. He also lied on his security clearance \napplication in February 2008, and to an OPM investigator in May 2008, when he was \ninterviewed, both felonies. His actions reflect a continuing pattern of criminal conduct \nand his most recent offenses are crimes of deception. I find none of the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and specifically considered the following: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal , professional, or community standing. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAppellant falsified material facts during his May 2008 security interview when he \ntold the OPM investigator he had stopped using illegal drugs in 1997, when in fact he \nhad used heroin and marijuana in 2002 and 2007, respectively. He also intentionally \nfailed to list his recent drug use on his security clearance application. Appellant\u2019s \npersonal conduct raises all of the above disqualifying conditions.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur, and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nAppellant intentionally lied to the OPM investigator and deliberately concealed \nrelevant information about his past drug history on his e-QIP. He did not want anyone to \nknow about his background. At his hearing, he stated he did not believe this information \nwas relevant. He acknowledged that no one other than his mother and his facility \nsecurity officer, are aware of his drug and criminal history. Considering Applicant\u2019s \nextensive drug and criminal history and his willingness to lie about it, I find none of the \nabove mitigating conditions applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country in the \nArmy and has taken steps in an attempt to put his life back on track. However, he has a \nlong drug and criminal history, with his most recent uses occurring in 2002 and 2007. In \naddition, he lied to the OPM investigator and lied on his e-QIP. He has shown a \ncontinuing pattern of deception and violating the law. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the guidelines for Drug Involvement, Criminal Conduct, \nand Personal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.q: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \nOn January 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 4, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on May \n7, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 18, 2009. The case was reassigned \nJune 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nto me on June 16, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled on June 16, 2009. \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf but did not submit any documentary \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 22, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since November 2005. He worked for a different defense \ncontractor from about February 2003 through November 2005. He has held a security \nclearance since 2003. He graduated magna cum laude from college in 2000 and \nsumma cum laude when he obtained his master\u2019s degree in 2003. He is single with no \nchildren.1  \n \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana periodically from about 1996 through September \n2005. He occasionally sold marijuana to his friends if he had any extra, but he did not \nsell for profit. He used a pill that he believes was ecstasy (MDMA) in 2003, and he took \necstasy on six to eight occasions between about July 2005 and September 2005.2  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in February 2003. \nQuestion 27 asked: \n \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?3 \n \nApplicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and stated that between \u201c1996/08/18\u201d and \u201c1999/05/31\u201d he \nused marijuana \u201cno more than 10\u201d times. This was inaccurate information because he \nhad used marijuana on multiple occasions up to the time he submitted the SF 86. \nApplicant admitted that he provided false information, but stated that he was not truly \nbriefed on the importance of the SF 86 or what a security clearance involved.4  \n \n \nApplicant was granted a Secret security clearance in 2003. He continued to use \nmarijuana after he was granted his clearance. He had a clearance, but he did not have \naccess to classified information. He stated that security was not emphasized at the \ncompany and he was never told about the importance of being drug-free while holding a \nclearance.5 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 19-28, 84; GE 1, 6, 8. \n \n2 Tr. at 32-41, 48-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3, 8. \n \n3 GE 9. \n \n4 Tr. at 32-37, 77-82; GE 9. \n \n5 Tr. at 19-22, 32-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant switched jobs to work for his current employer in November 2005. He \nsubmitted another SF 86 on December 6, 2005, to upgrade his Secret clearance to Top \nSecret/ Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). He answered \u201cYes\u201d in response \nto Question 27 and stated that between \u201c1996/08/18\u201d and \u201c2001/08/11\u201d he used \nmarijuana an \u201cunknown\u201d amount of times. He did not list his ecstasy use. He \nintentionally failed to list his ecstasy use and misrepresented the last time he used \nmarijuana.6   \n \nApplicant had a polygraph and interview in January 2006, pursuant to the request \nto upgrade his clearance to TS/SCI. He stated during the pre-polygraph interview that \nhe used marijuana between 1996 and 2002, and ecstasy on one occasion in 2003. After \nthe polygraph, he admitted that he used marijuana approximately one and a half times a \nmonth from 2002 through September 2005. He told the interviewer that he did not \ndisclose his full involvement with illegal drugs because he was told he would not receive \nhis clearance if he used illegal drugs within one year prior to the polygraph. He did not \ncorrect the amount of times he used ecstasy.7 \n \nApplicant was denied access to SCI in a clearance decision statement issued on \nMarch 2, 2006. The decision was based on his drug use and the falsification of his SF \n86 in December 2005.8  \n \nApplicant forwarded an appeal to the denial of his SCI access in a May 1, 2006 \nletter. He denied using marijuana between 2002 and 2005. He stated that after 2002 he \nonly used marijuana on one occasion in September 2005. He also stated that he only \nused what might have been ecstasy on one occasion in 2003. Applicant intentionally \nmisrepresented the extent of his drug use in his statement. Applicant\u2019s appeal was \ndenied on May 24, 2006. He was informed that he could reapply for SCI access in \nSeptember 2006.9 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a third SF 86 on October 11, 2006, in another attempt to \nupgrade his clearance to TS/SCI. He answered \u201cYes\u201d in response to Question 27 and \nstated that between \u201c1996/08/18\u201d and \u201c2005/09/30,\u201d he used marijuana an \u201cunknown\u201d \namount of times. He listed the use of an \u201cunknown\u201d substance on one occasion on \nJanuary 1, 2003. He intentionally did not list his ecstasy use in 2005.10  \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 26-29, 41-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6. \n \n7 Tr. at 55-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-3. The results of the polygraph are not \nconsidered for this decision, except insofar as the impact the polygraph had on Applicant providing details \nabout his drug use. \n8 GE 2. \n \n9 Tr. at 62-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 5. The SOR does not allege that Applicant \nfalsified the appeal letter. Any false statements that were not alleged will not be used for disqualification \npurposes. All of Applicant\u2019s statements will be considered in assessing his credibility, in the application of \nmitigating conditions, and in analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n10 Tr. at 72-76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant had another polygraph and interview in late 2006 or early 2007. He \nfully discussed and admitted to his drug use. He provided a written statement on \nSeptember 4, 2007, and again was truthful about his drug use.11  \n \n \nApplicant has not used illegal drugs since September 2005. He has matured and \nrealized that illegal drug use is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. He is \nwilling to sign a statement of intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.12  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n                                                          \n11 Tr. at 70-72, 75; GE 8. \n \n12 Tr. at 82-83, 89. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant possessed, used, and distributed illegal drugs. He continued to use \nillegal drugs after he was granted a security clearance in 2003. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g) are applicable as disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n\n \n6 \n \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana at a young age and used it regularly for \nyears. He used ecstasy in 2003 and on six to eight occasions in 2005. He continued to \nuse illegal drugs after he submitted his SF 86 and was granted a clearance. He was \ndishonest about his drug use on at least four occasions. He stopped using illegal drugs \nin September 2005. He has matured and now realizes it is inconsistent with the \nresponsibilities of his job and with holding a security clearance. He is willing to sign a \nstatement of intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n\n \n7 \n \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 in February 2003, December 2005, and \nOctober 2006. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable as a disqualifying condition. His drug use while \nholding a security clearance was also alleged under Guideline H. It establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c) and 16(e) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant was dishonest about his drug use on at least four occasions. He finally \nrevealed the extent of his drug use during a polygraph and interview in late 2006 or \nearly 2007, and again in his September 4, 2007 statement. I also found him to be \ncredible at his hearing. While he receives credit for finally being honest, that is \ninsufficient to overcome his multiple lies. I find that no mitigating conditions are \napplicable to the falsifications of his Security Clearance Applications. Applicant\u2019s drug \n\n \n8 \n \nuse while holding a security clearance is mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) \nunder the same rationale discussed under the Drug Involvement guideline. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 31 years old. He lied \nabout his drug use on multiple occasions and continued to use illegal drugs while \nholding a security clearance. He deserves some credit for finally coming clean about his \ndrug use and for abstaining from further drug use. However, I cannot ignore the number \nof times that he misrepresented the truth and falsified his answers during the security \nclearance application process over a several-year period. He appears to be remorseful, \nbut at this time, concerns remain about his truthfulness, judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Drug Involvement security concerns, but has not mitigated \nthe concerns raised under the Personal Conduct guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.m, 1.p, 1.v, 1.w, 1.y, 1.z, and 1.aa. The total amount \nowed for those ten debts is $22,630. He denied the remaining allegations. He also \nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance.  \n \n \nApplicant indicated that much of his financial problems can be traced to actions \nby his brother, cousin, and ex-wife. Applicant deployed to Iraq in 2003. He let his \nbrother and cousin live in his apartment while he was deployed. He let them use his \ndebit card and they were supposed to pay his bills and rent. He stated they did not pay \nthe bills, wrote checks on his bank account without his permission which were returned \nfor nonsufficient funds, and were evicted from the apartment for failing to pay the rent. \nHe also stated that they charged items and opened accounts in his name without his \npermission. Applicant chose not to press charges against his family members. He \nstated that several of the medical debts were incurred by his ex-wife while he was \ndeployed. He expected her to pay any deductible amount or co-payment and does not \nknow why she did not pay the bills. He has retained a credit resolution company \u201cto \nwork on removing derogatory/inaccurate items off his credit report.\u201d The company \nprovides limited credit counseling.2  \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the delinquent debt of $135 to a collection company, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He testified that he was unsure what the debt was for, but he \nthought it might be a duplicate of the $72 debt to a utility company which was alleged in \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 23-26, 49, 52-53, 57; GE 1; AE D. \n \n2 Tr. at 18-22, 27-28, 55-59; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE E, J.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.b, which alleges a $229 debt to the same collection \nagency as that listed in \u00b6 1.a. The two debts are listed on the credit report of March 10, \n2006, but not the three more recent credit reports in evidence. Applicant has not \ncontacted the creditor to inquire about either debt. The credit resolution company did \nnot dispute these two debts as they were not listed on the most recent credit reports.3   \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $3,810 to a collection company on \nbehalf of a cellular telephone company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He testified that he \nhad an account with the company but instead of sending him his monthly $38 bill, they \nsent him a bill of $3,800. He stated he has been disputing the bill with the company ever \nsince. When he called the telephone company, he was told they had no information \nabout the debt. This debt is listed on all the credit reports in evidence. The credit \nresolution company reported the debt as \u201c[c]urrently in dispute; awaiting resolution.\u201d4   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a debt of $239 to a collection company. Applicant denied any \nknowledge of this debt. Applicant submitted a combined credit report dated October 3, \n2008, with his response to DOHA interrogatories. That credit report indicates the \noriginal debt was to a jewelry store. Applicant admitted to purchasing a necklace from \nthe jewelry store, but believed he completed the payments to store. This debt is listed \non the credit reports of March 10, 2006 and September 16, 2008. The combined credit \nreport of October 3, 2008 lists the original debt under the jewelry company, but not \nunder the collection company. The combined credit report of January 29, 2009 only lists \nthe debt under the jewelry store and reports the debt was purchased by another lender, \nwith a zero balance.5   \n \n \nApplicant denied any knowledge of the $927 debt to a collection company, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. This debt is listed on the three most recent credit reports. The \ncredit resolution company reported the debt as \u201c[c]urrently in dispute; awaiting \nresolution.\u201d6   \n \n \nApplicant paid the $72 debt to a utility company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He \ndenied owing a debt of $156 to the same utility company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He \nstated that he did not realize that there were two debts to the utility company. He has \nnot contacted the utility company to determine the status of the $156 debt. The $156 \ndebt is listed on all the credit reports in evidence except the September 16, 2008 report. \nThe credit resolution company reported the debt as \u201c[c]urrently in dispute; awaiting \nresolution.\u201d Applicant also paid the $258 debt to a collection company on behalf of a \ndifferent utility company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j.7     \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 29-30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n4 Tr. at 30-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n5 Tr. at 32-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G.  \n \n6 Tr. at 35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n7 Tr. at 35-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the $370 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He \ntestified that he thought it was a payday loan that he took out before he deployed and \nthen forgot about it. He has not paid the debt. He stated that he did not have the \ncreditor\u2019s telephone number but would attempt to obtain it from the credit resolution \ncompany. The credit resolution company is attempting to have the debt deleted from his \ncredit report and reported the debt as \u201c[c]urrently in dispute; awaiting resolution.\u201d8     \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a debt of $66 for a returned check. Applicant stated that he \nbelieved his brother may have written this check while he was deployed. He has not \nchecked with the company to verify that he did not write the check. The debt is listed on \nall the credit reports in evidence except the September 16, 2008 report. The credit \nresolution company reported the debt as \u201c[c]urrently in dispute; awaiting resolution.\u201d9  \n \n \nA debt of $405 to a collection company, on behalf of a cable television provider is \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant stated that this debt was incurred by his brother and \ncousin without his authorization or permission while he was deployed. He indicated that \nhe spoke with the cable company after he returned from deployment. The company \nagreed to credit the amount of the bill if he provided the company a copy of his military \norders showing that he was in Iraq when the services were provided. He was unable to \nobtain a copy of the orders. This debt is listed on the credit reports of March 10, 2006 \nand September 16, 2008, but not the two most recent credit reports.10   \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $412 debt to an apartment landlord, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. He admitted that he lived in the apartment. He stated that he was late on one \npayment, but does not owe anything. He contacted the landlord after he saw the debt \non the credit report. He stated that the landlord admitted that he did not owe anything \nbut did not have an answer as to why the debt was listed as delinquent on his credit \nreport. The debt is listed as a charge off on the credit reports of March 10, 2006 and \nOctober 3, 2008, but neither report lists a balance. It is not listed on the other two \nreports.11   \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the $686 delinquent debt to a collection company on \nbehalf of a cellular telephone services company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. He has not \npaid the debt or contacted the creditor.12    \n \n \nApplicant denied any knowledge of the $91 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n, or the \n$1,250 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. These debts appear to be duplicates. The $91 debt is \nlisted on the credit report of October 3, 2008, with a $91 balance and a high balance of \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 36-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n9 Tr. at 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n10 Tr. at 39-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G.  \n \n11 Tr. at 41-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G.  \n \n12 Tr. at 42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n$1,250. It also appears on the January 29, 2009 credit report. The $1,250 debt does not \nappear on any credit report after March 10, 2006. The credit resolution company \nreported the $91 debt as \u201c[c]urrently in dispute; awaiting resolution.\u201d13 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the $5,376 delinquent debt to a company that \nprovides loans to military members, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. He has not paid the debt. \nHe indicated that he will contact the creditor to arrange a payment plan.

The original debt was to \na cellular telephone services company. Applicant denied owing this debt. The debt is \nlisted on all the credit reports in evidence except the September 16, 2008 report. The \ncredit resolution company reported the debt as \u201c[c]urrently in dispute; awaiting \nresolution.\u201d15 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the three medical debts totaling $333, as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.r through 1.t. He stated they were medical debts incurred by his ex-wife. The \nnames of the medical providers are not included in the credit reports. Only one debt, for \n$84, is listed on the most recent credit report. He denied any knowledge of the $50 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.u.

Applicant stated that he attempted to start \nan allotment to make the monthly payments on the loan while he was deployed, but the \nallotment was never started. His brother was supposed to make the payments, but he \ndid not. Applicant and the creditor agreed to settle the debt for $7,690. The settlement \ncalled for Applicant to make two payments of $385 each in January 2009, followed by \nmonthly payments of $200. Applicant made the first three payments totaling $970, \nwhich is what was required by the agreement as of the hearing date.17 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the $167 delinquent debt to a collection company on \nbehalf of a utility company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.w. He testified that he thought he paid \nthe debt and that he would obtain a receipt from the creditor. He also admitted that he \nowed the $134 delinquent debt owed to a different utility company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.y. He testified that he paid this debt and would provide a receipt. He did not submit a \nreceipt for either debt. Both debts are listed as delinquent on the three most recent \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 42-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n14 Tr. at 43-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE J. \n \n15 Tr. at 44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n16 Tr. at 44-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n17 Tr. at 45-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, K.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \ncredit reports.

The debt is not listed on the \nmost recent credit report.\u201d20  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.aa alleges a $286 debt to the U.S. Government. That debt was paid by \na seizure of Applicant\u2019s federal income tax refund.21   \n \n \nApplicant submitted two letters from his supervisors and a letter from the pastor \nat his church. He is described as a model employee who has completed all missions \nwith professionalism and good judgment; and \u201can outstanding citizen and asset to his \nfamily, church and community.\u201d He is recommended for a security clearance.22  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n18 Tr. at 47-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n19 Tr. at 47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G, J.  \n \n20 Tr. at 48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G.  \n \n21 Tr. at 48-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE G.  \n \n22 AE D. \n\n \n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes a number of the debts alleged in the SOR. His financial \nissues are ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. He attributed his financial issues to the \nactions of his brother and cousin while he was deployed with the Army. He also stated \nhis ex-wife did not pay her medical bills while he was deployed, which ended up on his \ncredit report. These qualify as conditions that were outside his control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant did not file police reports or anything else to hold his brother \nand cousin responsible for their actions. While it is understandable that one would not \nseek to have his brother arrested, that makes it more difficult to absolve Applicant of \nresponsibility for the debts. There is some mitigation for the debts that became \ndelinquent because of the actions of Applicant\u2019s brother and cousin. Their actions \nprovide minimal mitigation for the debts that were purely Applicant\u2019s responsibility. He \nhas worked for his current employer since August 2005, and only recently began \n\n \n9 \n \naddressing his delinquent debts. Applicant did not act responsibly regarding his \nfinances for a long period of time. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant received some credit counseling from the credit resolution company. \nHe paid several of his smaller debts and started payments on a large debt. However, he \nstill has debts to be resolved. The payments appear to be more of a reaction to the \nimpact on his security clearance, rather than a sincere acceptance of his financial \nresponsibilities. There have not been sufficient voluntary payments for Applicant to \nreceive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) as a good-faith effort to repay his overdue \ncreditors. I am also unable to find clear indications that his financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are partially applicable. \n \n \nThe credit resolution company attempted to remove derogatory/inaccurate items \nfrom Applicant\u2019s credit report. The company\u2019s purpose is to cleanse his credit report, \neven if he is responsible for the item. The company has disputed items that Applicant \nclearly stated were his responsibility. Several of the debts have been deleted from his \ncredit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is 30 \nyears old. He served in the Army for eight years. He deployed to Iraq, Kuwait, and \nAfghanistan with the Army and with his current employer. He is regarded as a model \nemployee. However, I continue to have concerns about his finances. If Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony about his brother, cousin, and ex-wife is accepted as true and if all debts that \nhave been disputed are disregarded, Applicant is still left with a large amount of \n\n \n10 \n \ndelinquent debts. He has worked for his current employer since 2005, and only recently \nbegan addressing his delinquent debts. His payments are a good start, but are \ninsufficient at this time to mitigate security concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.o: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.u: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.v-1.w: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.x:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.y-1.z: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.aa: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn March 21, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant two sets of interrogatories  regarding information in his background.\n1\nBased on the results of the background investigation and his response to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nFebruary 24, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 14 documents (Items 1 - 14) proffered in\n4\nsupport of the government\u2019s case. I have not considered Item 12 as it appears Department Counsel himself\nobtained this document in October 2009. Further, Items 13 and 14 do not constitute evidence in support of\nany of the SOR allegations. \n2\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request\n2\nfor access to classified information. On May 11, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nOn August 17, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. On October 22, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision.\n4\nApplicant received the FORM on November 13, 2009, and timely responded to the\nFORM in a two-page submission dated November 30, 2009. The case was assigned to\nme on February 1, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $47,369 for ten\ndelinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted\nwithout explanation all of the allegations. In addition to the facts established through\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 42 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nSeptember 2006. He served in the United States Navy between October 1986 and\nNovember 2006, when he retired as an Engineman First Class (EN1). He and his wife\nhave been married since June 1991. (FORM, Items 4 and 7)\nIn March 2008, when Applicant submitted his e-QIP, he answered \u201cno\u201d to all of\nthe questions pertaining to his finances (debts, bankruptcy, garnishments, etc.)\nHowever, a credit report obtained during his background investigation showed he was\ndelinquent or seriously past due on numerous debts totaling in excess of $47,000.\nSome of his debts are being satisfied through civil judgments and involuntary\ngarnishment. (FORM, Items 5, 6, and 11)\nIn June 2008, when he was interviewed by a government investigator, he\nacknowledged that he and his wife \u201csimply got in over their heads and [were] just\nstarting to address these financial issues.\u201d (FORM, Item 7) In response to DOHA\ninterrogatories in November 2008, he reiterated that he was paying off his debts\n\u201cslowly.\u201d (FORM, Item 6) Applicant has not presented information that shows he has\npaid or otherwise resolved any of the debts listed in the SOR. Two of those debts (SOR\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n3\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) are for less than $100 each and have been delinquent for almost two\nyears. (FORM, Items 5 and 8) When he responded to the FORM in November 2009, he\nasked that his clearance be revoked because he is still paying off his debts \u201cand it is\ngoing to take a while to do that.\u201d\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors under AG \u00b6 18\n(Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterest as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe available information supports the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j. Further,\nApplicant admitted each of the alleged debts, which total more than $47,000. Several of\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been unaddressed since mid-2005, and he has\nacknowledged that one cause of his debt problems was that he and his wife did not\nmanage their finances properly. Available information requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and AG \u00b6 19(e) (consistent\nspending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis).\nIn response, Applicant has not provided information to support any claims that he\nis paying off or otherwise resolving his debts. Further, there is no information to suggest\nthat his debts arose through unusual circumstances or events beyond his control.\nApplicant has not demonstrated that he has done anything, such as obtain financial\ncounseling or other professional guidance, to improve his financial standing. Finally, he\nhas not indicated that he is disputing any of debts attributable to him. Accordingly, none\nof the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 20 apply, and Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe security concerns established by the government\u2019s information about his finances. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 42 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. His marriage of 18 years and his 20 years of military\nservice reflect a stable, responsible lifestyle. However, the weight of the information\npresented shows he has failed to meet his financial obligations over the past several\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n5\nyears. He has not acted to resolve even the smallest of his debts despite being\ninterviewed about his finances almost two years ago. There is no information in this\nrecord about any other facet of his background that sufficiently counters the adverse\ninformation underlying the security concerns about his finances. A fair and\ncommonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances\n9\nshows he has failed to address satisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about his\nsuitability for access to classified information. Because protection of the national interest\nis paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\nnational interest.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

The record evidence\nshows Applicant has a history of financial problems, which are ongoing. In addition, he\nhas a 2009 conviction for second-degree assault for which he is serving probation. His\nfinancial problems, his criminal conviction, and his status as a probationer, when taken\ntogether, justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nAccordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nJuly 30, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n Exhibit G. \n2\n Tr. 63. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on February 4,\n1\n2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline J for criminal conduct.\nThe SOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to\ndecide whether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me March 19, 2010. The hearing took place April 30, 2010. The\nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received May 10, 2010.\nThe record was kept open until May 28, 2010, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit additional documentary information about his finances. He made a timely\nsubmission of 28 pages in total, which includes a cover letter. The matters are admitted,\nwithout objections, as Exhibit H (which includes Attachments A\u2013F). \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began his current\nemployment as a briefing officer in August 2007, and he is in good standing with his\nemployer.  He is married and has two children from the marriage, a 23-year-old son and\n2\na 17-year-old daughter. In addition, he has an adult daughter from a previous\nrelationship.\nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes more than 20 years of honorable military\nservice in the Army.  He served on active duty during 1983\u20131986. He then continued his\n3\nservice as a part-time soldier in the Army National Guard until 1988, when he began\nfull-time duties. He served until he retired in June 2007, as a senior noncommissioned\n\n Exhibit 2. \n4\n Tr. 101\u2013102. \n5\n Tr. 102\u2013103. \n6\n Exhibit 1. \n7\n Exhibits 8, 7, 6, and 5, respectively. \n8\n Tr. 124\u2013125. \n9\n Tr. 97\u201399. \n10\n3\nofficer (pay grade E-7). His discharge paperwork (the DD Form 214) reflects military\neducation consistent with his grade, and it reflects multiple decorations and medals, to\ninclude the Meritorious Service Medal (2  award), the Army Commendation Medal (3\nnd\nrd\naward), the Army Achievement Medal (4  award), and the Army Good Conduct Medal\nth\n(5  award).  \nth\n4\nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is about $81,000.  For 2009 his salary was\n5\n$79,000; it was $75,000 in 2008; and it was $75,000 in 2007, when he began his\ncurrent job. In addition, Applicant receives about $1,500 monthly ($18,000 annually)\nbetween a combination of retired pay and Veteran\u2019s disability compensation.  \n6\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in January 2007.  In\n7\nresponse to two questions about financial delinquencies, Applicant reported ten\ndelinquent accounts. Also, in response to a question about civil court actions, Applicant\nreported four judgments taken against him, two by a homeowners\u2019 association, one by a\nbank, and one by a utility company. He reported that all four judgments were paid.  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. For example, the credit reports in\nthis case reflect multiple public records related to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. A June\n2008 credit report lists five judgments and two liens; a November 2008 credit report lists\n15 judgments, several of which were satisfied, and four state tax liens; an August 2009\ncredit report lists four judgments and two liens; and a March 2010 credit report lists\nthree judgments and two liens.  None of the liens are alleged in the SOR. \n8\nApplicant points to his problematic marriage as the primary cause of his financial\nproblems.  His wife was a big spender while not making any meaningful contribution to\n9\ntheir household income for the last several years. She worked full-time until about 2002,\nwhen she quit to start her own business, which eventually failed, as a personal trainer.10\nIn addition, she pursued an expensive hobby or sport known as fitness or figure\ncompetitions. Applicant separated from his wife in April 2009, and they reconciled briefly\nuntil separating again in August 2009. Applicant remains separated from his wife and a\ndivorce has not yet begun. His minor daughter lives with his wife. A state court ordered\nApplicant to pay $1,000 monthly in support beginning in August 2009, and the order\n\n Tr. 121. \n11\n Tr. 122. \n12\n Tr. 114\u2013119. \n13\n Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 83 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9  ed., W est 2009) (an Alford plea is a \u201cguilty plea that a\n14\nth\ndefendant enters as part of a plea bargain, without actually admitting guilt\u201d).\n Exhibit 12. \n15\n Tr. 64\u201396.\n16\n4\nexpired or ended in April 2010.  To date, he has not been ordered to make child-\n11\nsupport payments for the benefit of his minor daughter.12\nAnother factor that contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems was the\nunexpected expenses he incurred in 2008\u20132009, due to the state criminal case for\nwhich he is now serving probation. In May 2008, he was arrested for second-degree\nassault stemming from his involvement in a mutual affray in his neighborhood.13\nApplicant was not the instigator, and it appears he was coming to the aid of his wife and\ndaughter when he became involved in the mutual affray that resulted in someone\nbreaking his finger. In response, Applicant tore off the individual\u2019s ear. In February\n2009, Applicant pleaded guilty, via an Alford plea,  and was sentenced to one year in\n14\njail, suspended, and probation for 18 months.  In addition, he was ordered to pay\n15\nrestitution directly to the victim as well as complete 240 hours of community work\nservice within six months. His probation is scheduled to end in about August 2010. \nThe SOR alleged 14 debts in some form of delinquency. The debts consist of\nthree unpaid judgments, four medical accounts in collection, six accounts in a collection\nor charged-off status, and a mortgage loan in foreclosure. Applicant addressed the\ndebts in his hearing testimony  and they are summarized in the table below.  \n16\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$3,055 unpaid judgment for\nhomeowners\u2019 association. \nUnpaid; balance of $3,945 and in a\nrepayment agreement as of March 2010\nmaking monthly payments of $256.\n(Exhibits C and H at Attachment E)\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$1,234 collection account. \nResolved; denies having account with\noriginal creditor; unable to verify account\nwith creditor.

He reports he is current with filing his state and federal income tax returns\nand does not owe back taxes.21\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n22\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n23\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n24\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n25\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n26\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n27\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n28\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n30\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that \u201cthe security suitability of an\n34\napplicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness\nor recurring financial difficulties.\u201d) (citation omitted). \n AG \u00b6 18.  \n35\n7\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n28\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n29\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.30\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.31\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n32\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n33\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline\n34\nF is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n35\n\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n36\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n37\n AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f). \n38\n8\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation within the defense industry. Indeed, the practice of evaluating a person\nbased on their record of financial responsibility (or lack thereof) is used in various\nindustries. For example, the insurance industry uses credit-based insurance scores\nwhen determining insurance rates because the scores have been found to be effective\nin predicting future losses.  \nThe record evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems or difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial\n36\nobligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish\n37\nthese two disqualifying conditions.\nUnder Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:38\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31, and 32 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n39\n AG \u00b6 30. \n40\n AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c).\n41\n AG \u00b6 31(d).\n42\n AG \u00b6 32(a). \n43\n Tr. 139. \n44\n9\nOf those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent here are subparagraphs (b) and (d).\nEach is discussed below.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from a combination of circumstances\nlargely beyond his control. His problematic marriage due to a spendthrift spouse was a\ncircumstance largely beyond his control that had a negative effect on his financial\nstability. He is now separated and might be headed toward divorce. Also, the May 2008\ncriminal case was unexpected and out-of-character for Applicant. Beyond the criminal\nconsequences, the incident compelled Applicant to spend money for attorney\u2019s fees and\nother expenses (i.e., restitution), money that could have been used to repay debt. \nIn addition, Applicant is making a good-faith effort to repay his overdue debts or\notherwise resolve the debts. As revealed by the table above, Applicant paid, settled, or\nresolved ten accounts, two judgments are unpaid but he is making payments, the\nmodification of the mortgage loan is pending final approval, and one judgment is\nconsidered unresolved due to lack of documentation.  \nTurning next to criminal conduct under Guideline J,  the suitability of an\n39\napplicant may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a criminal history\nrecord regardless of whether the criminal conduct at issue has been subject to\nprosecution and adjudication in a court of law. The overall concern under Guideline J is\nthat:\nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n40\nThe arrest, charge, and conviction for second-degree assault stemming from\nApplicant\u2019s involvement in the May 2008 mutual affray raise a security concern.  In\n41\naddition, his status as a probationer raises a concern as well.  But criminal conduct\n42\nhappened under unusual circumstances, which suggests that similar criminal conduct is\nunlikely to recur.  Indeed, in closing argument, Department Counsel accurately\n43\ncharacterized Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct as a \u201cone-off incident in [his] record, that he\ndoes not have any other criminal conduct on his record that we would be concerned\nabout.\u201d  \n44\n\n Exhibits 9 and 10. \n45\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n46\n10\nStanding alone, Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct does not pose undue security\nconcerns. But Applicant\u2019s financial problems, his criminal conviction, and his status as a\nprobationer, when taken together, justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. Although Applicant has made progress in addressing his financial\nproblems, it is too soon to tell if his financial problems were purely situational. Notably,\nsome of his financial problems have existed for a long time (i.e., the homeowners\u2019\nassociation obtained the two judgments in 2002 and 2004).  Likewise, having $29,912\n45\npast-due on a mortgage loan with a balance of $225,000 indicates that the loan was in\ndefault for some time. \nIt is also too soon to tell if Applicant is now conducting his affairs in a responsible\nmanner to avoid similar problems in the future. In this regard, the modification of his\nmortgage loan, which was in foreclosure, is still pending final approval. His marriage is\nalso in a state of flux or instability, which may result in further financial obligations for\nApplicant (i.e., spousal support or child support or both). In sum, the evidence shows\nApplicant has a large amount of turmoil in his life. His situation is a reminder of the\ncommonsense understanding that individuals in the middle of great emotions or turmoil\nare not safe risks.\nTo conclude, following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these\ndoubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\nconsideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, which\n46\nwas not insubstantial. Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.f\u20131.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b\u20131.e, 1.i\u20131.n:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 16, 2008. He \nanswered the SOR in writing on January 2, 2009, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on January 5, 2009. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 22, 2009, and I received the case \n \n \n \n \n1\nJuly 31, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nassignment on February 25, 2009.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 27, 2009, \nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 11, 2009. The Government offered \nExhibits 1 through 3, which were received without objection, except for objections to \nseveral subparts of Exhibit 3, the request for administrative notice on the Taiwanese \nGovernment. (Tr. 15-22)  Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A to E, and H to M, \nwithout objection. The Department objected to Applicant\u2019s exhibits F and G, which were \npolygraph test results and the curriculum vitae of the examiner.  I upheld the objections \nand did not receive those two exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 43)  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 18, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Taiwan and its government, known as the Republic of China. \n(Tr. at 11-22.) The request and the attached documents were admitted into evidence \nand were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit 3. The facts administratively noticed \nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 2, 2009, Applicant admitted all factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b61.a, to 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old, married with two children, and works for a defense \ncontractor of which he is a vice-president and a founder.  Applicant was born on Taiwan \nin 1957. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics at a Taiwanese university. After \ngraduation from college in 1980, Applicant served his mandatory military service in the \nTaiwanese Army for two years as a lieutenant in the personnel department.  He \nimmigrated to the United States in 1983 on a student visa.   He came to the United \nStates to obtain advanced degrees not offered at Taiwan universities. He graduated \nwith a master\u2019s degree in 1987, and later a doctorate degree in 1991, both degrees in \nmechanical engineering. Applicant was able to obtain an H1 visa in 1992, and became \na permanent U.S. resident in 1995.  He became a U.S. citizen in 2000. Applicant has \nvoted in U.S. elections, but never in a Taiwanese election. (Tr. 51-78, 100-102, 107, \n112, 134,150; Exhibits 1 and D)  \n \n \nApplicant is a research scientist and part owner of the company for whom he \nworks.  He owns 15% of that company.  He is also an officer and director of the \ncompany.  He co-founded the company in 1995 after moving to his present state of \nresidence.  He has owned homes in that state since then, and raised his children there.  \nHe does not own any foreign incorporated companies, nor does he have any real estate \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nor financial assets outside the United States.  Applicant owns four cars, one for each \nmember of his family. (Tr. 52, 54, 59-62, 88-94, 141-150; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born on Taiwan and came to the United States to advance \nher education.  They met while they were graduate students in the United States.  They \nmarried on Taiwan during a visit there in 1984.  Their daughter and son were born in the \nUnited States, and are 23 and 17 years old, respectively.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a chemist \nand safety engineer working for a foreign-owned automobile company.   She became a \nU.S. citizen in 2000 when Applicant became a U.S. citizen.  (Tr. 52, 53, 55-58, 80, 103; \nExhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan eight times since coming to the United States.  Each \ntrip was for family visits.  He stayed with family members on each trip to Taiwan. The \nDecember 1984 to January 1985 trip was for his marriage.  He traveled to Taiwan again \nfrom December 1987 to January 1988, and July to August 1995, and again in July 1997.  \nHe attended his father\u2019s funeral on a trip from August to September 2000, visited his \nmother in December 2003, and attended his mother\u2019s funeral in October 2004.  He \nvisited his wife\u2019s parents and family on their trip from November to December 2008.  \nEach trip after 1997 he reported to his company\u2019s security officer as required by \ncompany procedures. Applicant has participated in quarterly security training in his \ncompany since 1997. Applicant did not discuss his work with anyone while on these \ntrips. (Tr. 67, 99, 113-127, 143, 157) \n \n \nApplicant is the youngest of five children. His oldest sibling is his 62-year-old \nbrother.  This brother sells weather instruments for his own company.  Applicant is close \nto him, and calls him about twice a month.  This brother also obtained permanent \nresidency status in the United States through his wife\u2019s family.  Applicant\u2019s next oldest \nsibling is his sister, who works for a Taiwanese government research facility.  He does \nnot communicate with her, and has only seen her 12 times in the past 26 years.   She \ndid not attend one family function because she was working on a project and her \nsupervisors prohibited her attendance during that work.  This sister has a Taiwanese \nsecurity clearance.  His next oldest sibling is a brother, who is an architect for a private \ncompany.  Applicant does not communicate with him by email, and only has had 12 \ncontacts in the past 26 years.  Applicant\u2019s remaining sibling is a sister, who is a married \nhousewife on Taiwan.  He has not had much contact with her in the past 26 years.  All \nhis siblings live on Taiwan and are Taiwanese citizens.  Applicant\u2019s parents are \ndeceased. They were resident citizens of Taiwan. (Tr. 65-73, 129, 136-138, 144; \nExhibits 2 and E) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father-in-law live on Taiwan and are citizens of Taiwan.  \nHis in-laws have permanent residency in the United States through one of his wife\u2019s \nsisters who lives in the United States.  They do not travel much because of their ages.  \n(Tr. 127, 143-145; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nUntil he became a U.S. citizen, Applicant used his Taiwanese passport.  Since \n2000, Applicant has only used his U.S. passport for overseas travel.  His wife has both \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ntypes of passports, and his children only have U.S. passports. Applicant submitted a \nletter dated May 5, 2009, formally renouncing his Taiwan citizenship if his U.S. \ncitizenship oath in 2000 did not accomplish that purpose, which was his intent at the \ntime.  His letter also formally surrendered his expired Taiwanese passports. (Tr. 105-\n112, 130, 145; Exhibits 1, A to D, L) \n \n \nApplicant submitted four character statements from his colleagues at his place of \nemployment.  Each writer characterizes Applicant as an intelligent research scientist \nand a valuable member of the team on which he works.  The writers also have known \nApplicant for at least 15 years within the scientific community where they work.  They \nregard him highly as a professional and as a person.  Their comments are detailed and \npersuasive. The president of Applicant\u2019s employing company testified about the security \nprocedures the company uses, and that in his experience Applicant has complied with \nall procedures and has not mishandled classified or proprietary information.  He \nrecommends Applicant receive a security clearance. This witness also wrote Exhibit K. \n(Tr. 151-163; Exhibits H to K)  \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Taiwan.  The \nNationalist Government of the late Chinese president Chiang Kai-shek was defeated by \nthe Communist forces of Mao Tse-tung in 1948 for control of China.  While the \nCommunists established their government on mainland China, the Peoples Republic of \nChina (PRC), the Nationalists fled to the island of Taiwan and re-established their \ngovernment there (the Republic of China).  Taiwan has a population of 23 million \npeople, and a multi-party parliamentary democracy has evolved over the past 60 years. \nTaiwan did $466 billion in trade in 2007, having developed a strong economy over the \nyears. In 1979 the United States formally changed its recognition from Taiwan to the \nCommunist PRC government on the mainland of China as the sole legal government of \nChina. The United States maintains an unofficial relationship with Taiwan under the \n1979 Taiwan Relations Act, and sells defense military equipment to Taiwan pursuant to \nthat law. Taiwan is known as an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence.  Taiwan \nmaintains a large military establishment against the PRC government.  (Exhibits 3 and \nM) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interest, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n                                                          \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes nine conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members and his wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of \nTaiwan.  One of his sisters works for a Taiwan government research facility and has a \nsecurity clearance granted by that Government.  Applicant\u2019s monthly contacts with his \noldest brother and his eight visits to his family in the past 25 years also raise a security \nconcern. Finally, Taiwan is a known collector of U.S. economic and industrial \nintelligence for its own economic development.  AG \u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by \nthis evidence.   \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation.  Four conditions that could mitigate the disqualifications are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and, \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \n \nApplicant does not discuss his business and work with his relatives on Taiwan.  \nAs an officer in his employing company, he knows the necessity of maintaining the \nsecurity of classified and proprietary information.  Applicant\u2019s siblings are not engaged \nin the types of businesses which would seek the knowledge he has, except for his \nsecond oldest sibling who works for a Taiwanese government research facility.  But that \nrelationship is mitigated because he rarely speaks with her or sees her, being only 12 \nincidents of contact in 25 years. It is unlikely under the facts presented by Applicant that \nhe would be placed in a compromising situation wherein he would have to make a \nchoice.   AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has his work and property in the United States.  He made the \nconscious decision for his own purposes in 1983 to come to the United States to earn \nadvanced degrees.  He met and married his wife, and his children were born here.  His \nproperty and business, with its personal and professional relationships, are in the United \nStates.  His sense of loyalty to the United States is so great, and any residual feelings \nfor Taiwan so miniscule, that it is very evident he would resolve any conflict in favor of \nU.S. interests.  Therefore, AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his siblings other than his oldest one, and with his wife\u2019s \nparents, is casual and infrequent.  His contact with his oldest brother is not of that type.  \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has limited application. \n \nApplicant has promptly complied with all company and agency requirements \nabout his trips to Taiwan.  His company president and security officer testified to that \nfact.  Applicant knows the rules and follows them on these contacts with his family \nmembers.  AG \u00b6 8(e) applies.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant has spent 26 years \nbuilding his life in the United States.  He raised his family here, owns real estate here, \nand has not expressed any interest in returning permanently to Taiwan as shown by his \nbusiness interests in the United States. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen and has \nworked in a professional capacity for a firm based in the U.S. Both he and his wife were \neducated at U.S. universities. He is an entrepreneurial scientist, who has a share in his \nown company doing research.  Applicant is highly regarded in his scientific community, \nand is not likely to endanger that long-earned status by betraying the United States in \npreference to Taiwan. Applicant came to the United States for economic opportunity, \nand has realized his dream of obtaining advanced scientific degrees and financial \nprosperity.  Whether he could have done that on Taiwan, which is a populous and \nconfined island under the guns of the PRC on mainland China, is doubtful. The United \nStates offers Applicant more opportunities, which he recognized in 1983 and in the \nyears afterward.  Therefore, he has a greater attachment to the United States where he \nlives and works than to Taiwan, where he has only visited periodically in the past 26 \nyears. He has demonstrated his commitments to science and the United States for 26 \nyears. In contrast, his ties to Taiwan are minimal at this time. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence.  I \nconclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.d:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old customer service representative, who has been employed by a defense contractor since May 2005. He seeks to retain access to sensitive information in conjunction with a public trust position, which is a condition of his continued employment. (GE 1, Tr. 16-17, 19.) Applicant graduated from high school in May 2000. He attended three colleges for about two years after high school and is unsure how many college credit hours he has earned. He is unmarried and has no dependents. (GE 1, Tr. 17-19.) Financial Considerations Applicant has a history of financial problems that began as early as 2002. At some point in 2002, he was fired by his then employer, was out of work for \u201cthree or four months,\u201d and was then rehired by the employer who fired him. While he was unemployed, his car was repossessed when he was unable to make his car payments. (SOR \u00b6 1f (charged off account for $10,213).) (Tr. 21-22.) In 2004, he purchased a second car and later returned it to the creditor as a \u201cvoluntary\u201d repossession because he lost his license (SOR \u00b6 2a9 (past-due account for $3,497).)

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF-85P) on January 29, \n2008. On April 29, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F (financial \nconsiderations) and E (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); \nand the adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \nMarch 21, 2011\n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 4, 2010. He answered the SOR in writing on \nMay 20, 2011, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on July 12, 2010, and I was assigned the case on \nJuly 16, 2010.  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 22, 2010, scheduling the case for \nAugust 17, 2010. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 14, which were received without objection. \nApplicant did not offer any exhibits, but did testify on his own behalf. I held the record \nopen until August 27, 2010 to afford him the opportunity to submit additional evidence. \nApplicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 25, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old customer service representative, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since May 2005. He seeks to retain access to \nsensitive information in conjunction with a public trust position, which is a condition of \nhis continued employment. (GE 1, Tr. 16-17, 19.) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 2000. He attended three colleges \nfor about two years after high school and is unsure how many college credit hours he \nhas earned. He is unmarried and has no dependents. (GE 1, Tr. 17-19.)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems that began as early as 2002. At \nsome point in 2002, he was fired by his then employer, was out of work for \u201cthree or four \nmonths,\u201d and was then rehired by the employer who fired him. While he was \nunemployed, his car was repossessed when he was unable to make his car payments. \n(SOR \u00b6 1f (charged off account for $10,213).) (Tr. 21-22.) In 2004, he purchased a \nsecond car and later returned it to the creditor as a \u201cvoluntary\u201d repossession because \nhe lost his license (SOR \u00b6 2a9 (past-due account for $3,497).) (Tr. 22-25.) Applicant lost \nhis license for failure to pay numerous outstanding traffic-related tickets.  \n \n \nIn 2002, when he was not working, he attended school and, in order to pay bills \nand pay for school, he began withdrawing money from bank accounts with no funds \navailable. (Tr. 28.) By 2005, Applicant had acquired a number of debts and looked into \ndebt consolidation. In November 2008, he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy listing $54,171 in \nunsecured debt. In March 2009, he was awarded a discharge. (SOR \u00b6 1a) (GE 10, Tr. \n29-30.)  \n \n\n3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges five debts approximating $39,000. (Tr. 10.) Three of the debts \nalleged in the SOR were included in Applicant\u2019s March 2009 discharge. Those \ndischarged debts are: (1) SOR \u00b6 1d \u2013 collection account for $898 originally owed to a \nlocal court and assigned to a collection agency; (2) SOR \u00b6 1e \u2013 collection account for \n$250 originally owed to a local check cashing company and assigned to collection \nagency; and (3) SOR \u00b6 1f \u2013 charged-off account for balance owed of $10,213 to an \nautomobile financing company after his vehicle was repossessed.  \n \n \nThe two remaining unresolved SOR debts owed and not discharged are: (1) SOR \n\u00b6 1b - past-due account for $8,000 owed to a local court for traffic tickets, and (2) SOR \u00b6 \n1c \u2013 federal tax lien filed in November 2008 in favor of the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) in the amount $20,408 in taxes, penalties, and interest. Applicant attached a \npayment schedule from a local court reflecting that he owed $617. (SOR Response.) \nApplicant explained that this amount was \u201cpart of the $8,000 that I owe.\u201d (Tr. 32.) The \npayment schedule requires Applicant to pay $165 per month; however, he testified that \nhe can only pay $50 per month. He indicated at his hearing that he could provide proof \nof payment. (Tr. 33-34.) Applicant did not submit any proof of payment for his $617 \npayment schedule or documentation that he was making any progress towards paying \nhis $8,000 debt to the local court. Applicant does not currently have a driver\u2019s license, \nand it is his understanding that he will not get his license back until he pays the $8,000 \nin fines.  \n \n \nApplicant began accruing tickets when he was 16 and did not pay his fines \nbecause he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it would be an issue.\u201d (Tr. 34-35.) In 2002, he was arrested on \nan outstanding warrant for failure to pay his traffic tickets. He claims that he did not \nknow that he owed traffic-related fines until he was arrested. His state department of \nmotor vehicles revoked his driver\u2019s license in 2003 for failure to pay outstanding traffic \nfines. Since his license was revoked, Applicant has been cited at least two times for \ndriving-related offenses, the most recent offense being in 2009. (AE 13, Tr. 35-37.) \nApplicant testified that he has not driven since then and takes the bus as his primary \nmeans of transportation. (Tr. 37.) \n \n \nThe IRS lien for $20,408 stemmed from Applicant\u2019s federal tax liabilities for years \n2006, 2007, and 2008. One month after his SOR was issued, the IRS began garnishing \nApplicant\u2019s pay at the rate of $100 per pay period. According to the May 2010 IRS \ngarnishment letter, the amount they are attempting to collect from the Applicant is \n$9,239.32. However, Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect an IRS lien for $20,408 filed in \nNovember 2008. Applicant was unable to explain this discrepancy. (SOR Response, GE \n4, GE 5, GE 6, AE B. Tr. 37-39.) Applicant stated that he did not file correct federal \nincome tax returns because, \u201cI was dumb, being young.\u201d (Tr. 39.) He received notices \nfrom the IRS that he owed them money and disregarded them until May 2010 claiming \nhe did not have the money to pay his taxes. (Tr. 39-40.)  \n \n \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant revealed that he fraudulently claimed he \nwas the father of children not his when filing his income taxes. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant \nfurther revealed that he had the same issues with his state income taxes; however, the \nstate has not pursued him until recently. (Tr. 42-43.) Applicant\u2019s August 2010 pay stub \n\n4 \n \nreflects bimonthly gross pay of $1,426.80. His net pay after deductions $877.32. (AE B, \nTr. 43.) His net monthly pay averages $1,755. Applicant does not have a budget per se, \nand pays bills \u201cthat are important to [him].\u201d He acknowledged that his methodology is \nnot financially responsible. (Tr. 48-49.) Applicant has no savings and claims his one \ncredit card account is current. (Tr. 49-50.) Additionally, Applicant owes $33,157 in \ndeferred student loans that were due in October 2010. He hoped to get another \ndeferment based on financial hardship because he is unable to repay his student loans. \n(GE 5, Tr. 50-52.) \n \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to an undetermined period of \nunemployment in 2002, discussed supra, and a period of unemployment from May 2003 \nto December 2003. (GE 1, Tr. 25-26.) He also mentioned that he provided occasional \nfinancial assistance to his mother. During cross-examination, Applicant was asked if he \nintended to make a budget for himself and he responded, \u201cI want to.\u201d (Tr. 49.) He later \nindicated that he intended on making a budget. (Tr. 52.) Applicant did not submit a \nbudget in any of his post-hearing exhibits. I note that Applicant completed mandatory \ncredit counseling in February 2008 in conjunction with his filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \n(GE 10.) However, there is no evidence that his financial situation is resolved or under \ncontrol. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nWhen Applicant completed his Public Trust Position Application (SF-85P) in \nJanuary 2008, he failed to list any loans or financial obligations that were 180 days \ndelinquent. Specifically, he failed to list delinquent debt itemized in his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy filed in November 2008. The SOR identified nine separate debts that \nApplicant failed to list that were included in his bankruptcy. Applicant certified by his \nsignature when completing his SF-85P that the information he provided was true, \ncomplete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and made in good faith. \nHe further acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement on his SF-85P can \nbe punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  \n \nApplicant admitted that he did not list any of his debts on his SF-85P claiming \nthat he did not think he had to list those debts. He explained that he was in the process \nof filing for bankruptcy. He stated that he had previously submitted an SF-85P and the \ninformation was lost. When Applicant had submitted an SP-85P in May 2004, he also \ndid not list any loans or financial obligations that were 180 days delinquent. He denied \nthat he was trying to avoid disclosure of his debts to the Government when completing \nhis SF-85P reiterating that, \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was needed for my job.\u201d (GE 14, Tr. 53-\n57.) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted one reference letter and a letter that he wrote \non his own behalf. The reference letter was from his immediate supervisor. His \nsupervisor noted that she has worked with the Applicant for the last four years. She \n\n5 \n \nprovided favorable comments about the Applicant and noted that he would be missed if \nhis clearance was not granted. (AE C.)  \n \nAmong the topics discussed in Applicant\u2019s letter, he admitted \u201cto withholding \ninformation, but this was not an intentional thing.\u201d He claimed he provided what he \n\u201ccould remember at the time or what I thought would suffice.\u201d He stated he is attempting \nto pay off his outstanding debts, but did not submit any documentation that he was \nmaking payments to the state for his outstanding traffic tickets. He requested a \nfavorable decision regarding his application for a public trust position. (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n\n6 \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe Guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated five debts approximating $39,000 \nand filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2008. His indebtedness began as early as \n2002 and has been ongoing. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n7 \n \n                                                          \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there is \nmore than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. Therefore, \nhis debt is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant receives partial credit because his unemployment in \n2002 and 2003 was largely beyond his control. However, to receive full credit under this \nmitigating condition, Applicant has to demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. I note that his most recent unemployment occurred five years before he \nfiled Chapter 7 bankruptcy and seven years before his SOR was issued. Applicant had \na significant period of time to evaluate his financial situation and make adjustments in \nthe five-plus years since his last unemployment. There is no evidence that Applicant \nremained in contact with his creditors or tried to make minimum payments during this \ntime.1 Under these facts, I am unable to apply full credit under this mitigating condition. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. Although Applicant participated in the \nmandatory credit counseling required when he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2008, it is \nclear that his financial situation is not resolved or is under control. Likewise, there is not \nsufficient evidence in the record to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d).2 Despite \n \n1 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner \nwhen dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he \nmaintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his debts \ncurrent. \n \n2 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \n\n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nhaving being employed full-time since May 2005, there is no evidence that Applicant \nhas made much of an effort to repay his overdue creditors. He did not provide proof that \nhe was making payments on his $8,000 traffic-related debt to his state and he recently \nstarted making $100 payments per pay period to the IRS through garnishment. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is not applicable because Applicant does not dispute the validity of the debts \nalleged. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the concern is that conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15.) \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately provided false information or omitted \nrequired information on his January 2008 SF-85P. Applicant\u2019s explanation that he did \nnot think such information was needed for his job is insufficient to overcome his \nobligations to tell the complete truth during the security clearance vetting process. Nor is \nhe excused from providing required financial information because he was contemplating \nfiling bankruptcy. 3 The Government established through the evidence presented the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a). \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n3 Deliberate and materially false answers on a security clearance application violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \nThe Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a \nstatement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making \nbody to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004). \n\n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nSix personal conduct mitigation conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nA statement is false when it is made deliberately -- knowingly and willfully. An \nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely \nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely \nthought the information did not need to be reported. Here, Applicant knew of financial \nproblems and chose not to disclose them. He certified his answers to be true and \ncorrect. Had Applicant\u2019s information been relied upon without verification, he may well \nhave successfully vetted for a public trust position. Regardless of the reason Applicant \nchose not to be forthcoming, the process does not allow for applicants to pick and \nchoose which answers they will answer correctly. When applicants lie on their public \ntrust position applications, they seriously undermine the process as Applicant did in this \ncase. I find that none of the mitigating conditions fully apply.4  \n \nMaking a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential \nsentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 fine).  \n \n4 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \n\n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nwhole-person concept analysis. To Applicant\u2019s credit, he seems to have found a niche \nin his current employment. His immediate supervisor provided favorable comments \nabout him and his performance. However, I cannot overlook his history of financial \nirresponsibility and personal conduct. Collectively, these concerns show a pattern of \nbehavior that is troubling. He demonstrated indifference in incurring and resolving \nnumerous traffic tickets he accumulated over the years. His problems with the IRS were \nof his own doing when he chose to claim dependents that were not his.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose information on his public trust position \napplications is serious, recent, and not mitigated. Overall, I have concerns about his \ncurrent ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole-person, I conclude he has not mitigated security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \n \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n11 \n \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant has not fully mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to a public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1a \u2013 1g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Payments on his \nmortgage were also $17,000 delinquent. He paid two debts totaling $750 and included \nanother debt in a repayment plan. Applicant failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under financial considerations. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n  \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nAugust 25, 2009\n\n  \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on March 2, 2008, detailing security concerns about his \nfinances. \n  \n \nOn March 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated May 12, 2009. The FORM contained ten \nattachments. On May 19, 2009, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along with \nnotice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nResponses to the FORM are due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due on June 18, 2009. As of July 31, 2009, no response had been \nreceived. On August 6, 2009, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations related to the \nmortgage debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.n. He admitted the remaining debts. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of \nthe record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years and has worked for a defense contractor in procurements \nsince December 2007, and is seeking to obtain security clearance.  \n \n \nIn June 2008, Applicant entered into an agreement with a company to assist in \npaying his delinquent debts. He agreed to pay a $249 fee plus make monthly deposits \nof $156. Included in the monthly installment fee is a $49 maintenance fee. Applicant \nalso agreed that twenty-five percent of the difference between the amount demanded by \na creditor and the amount a creditor agreed to take in settlement will be paid to the \ncompany as an additional settlement fee. (Item 8, page I 19) If Applicant pays the entire \namount of the debt, the company will receive five percent of the amount paid as a fee. \n(Item 8, page I 19)  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that any amount between what he originally owed on a \ndebt and the amount the debt settles for will be reported to the IRS as ordinary income. \n(Item 8, page I 18) Only one (SOR \u00b6 1.i, $2,125) of the 14 SOR debts is included in the \nagreement. (Item 8, page I 21) On June 16, 2008, he paid the company $253.95 and \nmade $160 payments on October 1, 2008, October 17, 2008, and November 17, 2008. \n(Item 8, pages I 23 and I 26) There is no documentation to establish that payment has \nbeen made on any debt or payment made to the company after November 2008. \n \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n  \n3 \n \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant answered written interrogatories related to his \nfinances. (Item 8) He indicated the $1,700 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k), $1,508 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g), \n$738 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and the $1,294 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) were also included in the \nagreement. However, debts listed in the repayment agreement were not the names of \nthe creditors listed in the SOR. (Item 8, page I 24) Applicant\u2019s January 2009 credit \nbureau report (CBR) indicates these four accounts were transferred or sold. Applicant \nfailed to establish they were sold to the creditors listed in his agreement with the debt \ncompany.  \n \nIn his response to interrogatories, Applicant disputed the amounts owed on three \naccounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, $3,500, 1.c., $1,862, 1.d, $10,765) with the same creditor. He \nstated that the debt management company was working with the creditor to resolve the \nmatter. Applicant asserted the accounts were related to a failed business, for which he \nprovided no additional information. (Item 8, page I 15) Applicant disputed charges \nadded to the accounts after July 2007. Applicant failed to document which charges were \nincurred before notifying the creditor of the failed business and which occurred after July \n2007.  \n \nApplicant asserted he consolidated accounts with the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n($506) He asserted this was a family business account with a consolidated balance of \n$23,875. (Item 8, page I 13) The debt was settled and paid in the amount of $4,701. \n(Item 8, page I 14) However, there is no evidence the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.k was part \nof the consolidation. The account numbers do not indicate a consolidation.  \n \nApplicant paid the $280 telephone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a). (Item 8, pages I 9, I 10, I \n11) Applicant had two loans with a mortgage lender, a $256,000 conventional first real \nestate mortgage and a $57,571 second mortgage. (Item 8, page I 7) Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2009 CBR lists $16,199 past due on the first mortgage and $1,178 past due on \nthe second mortgage. (Item 9, page C 8) Applicant provided a letter from his ex-wife \nwhich stated she was paying the mortgage and would, at some future date, refinance \nthe mortgage and have Applicant\u2019s name removed from the mortgage loan. There is no \nevidence the mortgage loan has been refinanced, nor is there evidence Applicant is not \nliable on these mortgages. Applicant asserts his wife is responsible for the $60 \ntelephone bill listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \n \nThe record fails to indicate when the divorce occurred. As of March 2008, when \nApplicant completed his Questionnaire for National Security Positions, Standard Form \n(SF) 86, he was still married. (Item 4, pages 9 and 10 of 14) He indicated he had been \nseparated since June 2007. (Item 4, page 10 of 14) Under additional comments in his \nSF 86, he referrs to his \u201cex-wife\u201d as sole owner of the home. (item 4, page 7 of 8) \n \nThe FORM put Applicant on notice that he had failed to provide proof regarding a \nnumber of his debts or assertions. Additionally, he was notified that his repayment plan \ndid not include a number of the SOR debts. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. \nTherefore, no additional documentation was received related to his debts.  \n\n  \n4 \n \n \nA summary of the 14 SOR debts and their current status follows:  \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na \nAccount placed for \ncollection for a telephone \ncompany.  \n$244 \nPaid.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n  \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He has 11 unpaid debts totaling \napproximately $24,500. Additionally, as of January 2009, his first and second \nmortgages were more than $17,000 past due. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n  \n7 \n \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His \nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and they occurred under \ncircumstances likely to recur. He failed to demonstrate that his debts were largely due to \ncircumstances beyond his control, or that he has acted responsibly in addressing his \ndebts. Further, he has not sought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem \nunder control as his circumstances permitted.  \nApplicant asserts five SOR debts are included in a debt payment agreement, but \nonly one (SOR 1.i) is listed in the creditor\u2019s list. The other four accounts have been sold \nor transferred and might be the accounts listed in the creditor\u2019s list, but Applicant failed \nto document they are the same debts. Applicant failed to show any payments to the \nplan after November 2008.  \n \n \nApplicant states his ex-wife is owner of the home and asserts she is responsible \nfor the mortgages. The fact Applicant may have relinquished ownership in the home \ndoes not have any legal effect on his obligation to repay the mortgage. Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife submitted a letter stating she intended to refinance the mortgage notes and have \nApplicant removed from the loans. Such an agreement may be binding on Applicant and \nhis wife, but it has no binding effect on the creditor.  \n \nAt some future time, the mortgages may be refinanced and Applicant relieved of \nliability. The creditor would have to agree to the release. The creditor is unlikely to \nrelease Applicant from liability while the mortgages remain more than $17,000 past due.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the debts are numerous and remain unpaid. \nApplicant has failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies. Applicant mentioned a family business which failed in 2007 and indicated he \nhad been separated since June 2007. These are normally conditions beyond a person\u2019s \ncontrol. However, he failed to provide any documentation as to why the business failed \nor the impact of the failure on his finances. Additionally, he failed to establish how his \nfinances were impacted by his separation.  \n \n\n  \n8 \n \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling, nor is there an indication his financial problems are under control. \n \nAG & 20(d), a good-faith effort to repay creditors, applies to two debts he paid \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.f). This good-faith effort also applies to the jewelry account listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, which is included in the debt repayment agreement. However, Applicant \nfailed to document that the four other SOR debts he asserts are part of the debt \nagreement are included in that agreement. There is no documentation establishing that \nthe four creditors listed in the SOR are part of the debt repayment agreement.  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant has failed to establish that any of his creditors have \nreceived payment under this debt repayment agreement. He entered into this \nagreement and paid the company more than $700. However, there is no showing that \nany creditor received payment pursuant to the agreement. Nor has Applicant \nestablished he is still making payments to the plan. Other than the three debts \npreviously addressed, Applicant has not established he has paid, is making payments \non, or is no longer liable on the remaining 11 debts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nBecause Applicant chose to have this matter handled administratively, I am \nunable to evaluate his demeanor or form a positive determination as to his truthfulness. \nFrom the record, I am unable to find Applicant was sincere, open, and honest. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances available in the record of this case. Applicant is 40 years old and should \nbe sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his finances. Applicant has \nnumerous debts and has only paid two. He gave up ownership in the home and asserts \n\n  \n9 \n \n \nhis ex-wife is responsible for the mortgages on that property. The first and second \nmortgages are more than $17,000 past due. His mortgage lender is not bound by the \narrangement between Applicant and his ex-wife.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b\u20141.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g and 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j\u20141.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nStephen M. Weiss, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 19, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline D\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines J and D are not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\n2\n(Sexual Behavior), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 24, 2010, after the\nhearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge erred in his application\nof the Guideline E mitigating conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was\nerroneous.   Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 66-year-old engineer\nfor a Defense contractor.  He served in the U.S. Navy from 1961 to 1964 and has held a security\nclearance since 1983.\nFrom 2003 to 2007, Applicant dated a woman (W) who had a teenage daughter (D).  From\n2005 to 2006, W and D lived with Applicant.  One evening Applicant and D drove to a nearby store.\nAfter shopping, D told Applicant that she wanted to drive the car.  She was 15 years old at the time.\nApplicant told her no, but they continued to argue as Applicant drove them home.  Eventually\nApplicant pulled the car over to the side of the street and stopped it.  He put his hand on D\u2019s breast\nand asked her if she wanted to drive.  D backed away from Applicant, who then apologized.  \nTwo days later, D reported the incident to the school counselor, who then reported it to a\nlocal social services agency.  A representative of the agency interviewed D, with a police officer\npresent.  Afterward, the police took D to the police station, where they recorded a phone call between\nD and Applicant.  During this conversation Applicant acknowledged touching D\u2019s breast,\napologized, and told her not to tell W. \nThe police asked Applicant to come to the station for an interview.  Though he acknowledged\nto the police that he spanked D on her bare bottom approximately twice weekly, he denied having\ntouched her breast.  However, once the police played a tape of his telephone conversation with D,\nApplicant admitted touching her breast.  Applicant\u2019s initial denial of having touched D\u2019s breast\nformed the basis of the Guideline E allegation at issue in this appeal.  Applicant was charged with\nfelony sexual abuse, pleading guilty to disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor.  He voluntarily\nunderwent psychological counseling.  His counselor stated that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was good.\nDuring the hearing, Applicant characterized the breast-touching incident as accidental.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant had attempted to minimize his misconduct with D,\nwhich precluded a favorable application of any Guideline E mitigating conditions.  Applicant\ncontends on appeal that this was error.  He asserts that there is no basis in the record to support the\nJudge\u2019s view that Applicant minimized his misconduct.  We have considered this argument in light\nof the entire record.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had touched D\u2019s breast intentionally and\n\nAlthough the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s misconduct established security concerns under Guidelines J and\n2\nD, he concluded that Applicant had mitigated these concerns by evidence of his voluntary counseling, the lack of\nrecurrence of such misconduct, and his good employment record.  \nIn addition to the Judge\u2019s findings concerning the circumstances underlying the incident, we note record\n3\nevidence that Applicant had fondled D\u2019s breasts \u201con several occasions\u201d and that once he had watched her as she took\na shower. Government Exhibit (GE) 1, Sheriff\u2019s Department Detail Incident Report, at 9, 13.  This document also\ncontains a description at p. 16 of Applicant\u2019s statement to the Sheriff concerning the event.  \u201c[H]e said [D] had wanted\nto drive home . . . and he told her no.  He said she became upset and . . . as he was driving home, he pulled over to the\nside of the road . . . on a side street.  He said he lifted his right hand and placed it on her breast and then asked her if she\nwanted to drive.\u201d  Applicant objected to GE 1 at the hearing.  Although Applicant did not explicitly raise the Judge\u2019s\nadmission of GE 1 as an issue on appeal, he described his objection in a footnote to his appeal brief.  His contention at\nthe hearing was that the document contained multiple levels of hearsay and was not sufficiently credible as to incidents\nof misconduct not alleged in the SOR.  Because he did not actually raise the admissibility of GE 1 as an appeal issue,\nwe simply note that Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 permits the admission in DOHA hearings of official records or evidence\ncompiled in the regular course of business, other than DoD personnel background reports of investigation.  See ISCR\nCase No. 08-90480 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2010) (Sheriff\u2019s booking report admissible under this provision of the\nDirective).  The evidence contained in GE 1 and described above supports the Judge\u2019s finding of intentional sexual\ncontact. \n     \n At the hearing, Applicant testified that the incident occurred on the road while he and D were returning from\n4\nshopping.  Tr. at 87-92.  His statement to the Sheriff was similar.  Applicant said to the Sheriff that, during the drive\nhome, he and D began arguing about her driving, and he pulled onto a side road.  GE 1 at 16.  Subject\u2019s psychologist,\nhowever, described the incident somewhat differently.  The psychologist stated that D had jumped into the driver\u2019s seat\n3\nthat the incident constituted sexual contact.   This conclusion is sustainable.   In light of that,\n2\n3\nApplicant\u2019s contention during his security clearance interview and at the hearing that the touching\nwas merely accidental could reasonably be construed as an attempt to minimize the misconduct.  The\nJudge properly considered this minimization in the context of Applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as\nto mitigation of the security concern arising from his false statement to the police.  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion is sustainable.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not perform a proper whole-person analysis.  He noted\nsuch matters as Applicant\u2019s lack of prior criminal history; his ultimate conviction of a misdemeanor\nrather than a felony; his willingness to discuss the incident when so requested; his good work\nperformance; the absence of reoffense; and his long having held a security clearance.  He argues that\nthese factors strongly outweigh evidence of Applicant\u2019s false statement to the police in November\n2006.  \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009).  Although he need not cite or discuss every piece\nof record evidence, in this case the Judge gave explicit consideration to most of the things to which\nApplicant refers.  Moreover, he also provided a reasonable explanation for his conclusion that\nApplicant had failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns, notably his having minimized\nthe incident in question.  In addition, we note record evidence of apparent inconsistent statements\nby Applicant concerning the circumstances of his sexual contact with D.   These statements are\n4\n\nof the car and Applicant touched her breast in trying to move her over to the passenger side of the front seat.  Applicant\nExhibit H at 4.  As this description of the event presumably came from Applicant, it is different from his statement to\nthe police and at the hearing in significant ways.  See, e.g., Applicant\u2019s description of the event, quoted in n. 3 supra.\n4\npertinent to an evaluation of Applicant\u2019s credibility.  See ISCR Case No. 08-08579 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 16, 2009).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record\nevidence.  Neither has he demonstrated that the Judge weighed in the record evidence in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10204 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJun. 21, 2010).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Weiss, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns generated by his sexual behavior and\ncriminal conduct, but failed to mitigate the security concern generated by his personal\nconduct. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn June 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under the sexual\nbehavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct guidelines. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 23, 2009, admitting the allegations except\nSOR subparagraph 3.a. On September 9, 2009, the case was assigned to another\nMay 21, 2010\n\n2\nadministrative judge who scheduled the hearing for December 9, 2009. On December 3,\n2009, the hearing was continued. On December 15, 2009, the case was reassigned to\nme. On January 13, 2010, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for\nFebruary 2, 2010. At the hearing, I received five Government exhibits, eight Applicant\nexhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. The transcript was received on\nFebruary 12, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 66-year-old married man with four adult children. Three previous\nmarriages ended in divorce. He is a veteran of the United States (U.S.) Navy where he\nserved from 1961 to 1964. He was honorably discharged. (Tr. 48) He has taken some\ncourses at a community college over the years.\nSince 2001, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as an engineer. He\nwrites test code for guided missiles. (Tr. 49) He worked for the same company as a\ncontractor during the previous six years. (Tr. 47) Applicant has held a security clearance\nsince 1983. (Tr. 48) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. A former coworker whom Applicant\nsupervised described him as a trustworthy person and an excellent engineer. (Tr. 103,\n107) Since working for his current employer, Applicant has earned multiple accolades\nincluding the Team Award in 2008, and the Individual Achievement Awards in 2005 and\n2006. (see generally, AE D) \nFrom 2003 to 2007, Applicant dated a woman with a teenage daughter. (Tr. 83)\nBetween 2005 and 2006, his girlfriend and her daughter lived with him. One evening in\nNovember 2006, Applicant and his girlfriend\u2019s daughter drove to the store. Applicant\nhad consumed three to four glasses of wine before they left the home. (AE 1 at 16) After\nthey finished shopping, his girlfriend\u2019s daughter, aged 15, asked to drive the car. (Tr. 86)\nApplicant refused, and she began arguing with Applicant. She continued to argue with\nhim as they drove home. Subsequently, he pulled the car over to the side of a street,\nstopped it, put his hand on her breast, then asked her if she wanted to drive. (GE 1 at\n16) She then backed away from Applicant, \u201cas far as she could get,\u201d whereupon\nApplicant apologized. (Tr. 92)\nApproximately two days later, the teenager reported the incident to a school\ncounselor who then reported it to the local social services agency. (AE 1 at 9) A\nrepresentative from the agency then interviewed the girl. A detective was present at the\ninterview. (AE 1 at 9)\nAfter the interview, the police took the girl to the police station and arranged for\nher to call Applicant. Unbeknownst to Applicant, the police officer was listening to the\nconversation and recording it. (AE 5 at 4) During the conversation, Applicant\nacknowledged touching the girl\u2019s breast, apologized, and told her not to tell her mother.\n(AE 1 at 10, 14)\n\n3\nThe police then contacted Applicant and asked him to come to the station for an\ninterview. (AE 1 at 10) Although Applicant admitted that he spanked his girlfriend\u2019s\ndaughter on her bare bottom to reprimand her approximately twice weekly, he\nstrenuously denied touching her breast. (AE 1 at 10-11) The police then replayed the\ntape of Applicant\u2019s conversation with his girlfriend\u2019s daughter. Applicant then admitted\ntouching the girl\u2019s breast. (AE 1 at 16) \nApplicant was then charged with sexual abuse, a class five felony in the state\nwhere the incident occurred, which carries a maximum penalty of two and a half years\nin prison. (A.R.S. \u00a7 13-701) Subsequently, Applicant pleaded guilty to disorderly\nconduct, a misdemeanor. (Tr. 43) The court then sentenced him to three years of\nunsupervised probation. (Tr. 68) Upon being charged with the initial offense, Applicant\nnotified his employer. (Tr. 69)\nWhile on probation, Applicant voluntarily attended counseling with a licensed\npsychologist. He attended five sessions from March 2007 to May 2007. (AE H) The\npsychologist, a member of the American Psychological Association, and the Association\nfor the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, (AE F) characterized Applicant as \u201ca motivated\nclient [who] participated fully in the discussions, and followed through with suggestions.\u201d\n(AE E) According to the psychologist, Applicant\u2019s main concern when he entered\ntreatment was to understand why he did what he did. (AE H at 1) At the conclusion of\nthe therapy, the psychologist determined that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was good, and that\nno further therapy was necessary. (AE H at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the mother of the girl he touched inappropriately\nended approximately four months after the incident. He has not had any contact with the\ngirl since she reported the episode to the school counselor.\nApplicant\u2019s probation ended in March 2010. At the hearing, Applicant\ncharacterized the touching the breast of his then-girlfriend\u2019s daughter as accidental. (Tr.\n60, 89-91)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (Id.) \nThe potentially applicable disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d Because Applicant committed one crime, not multiple\nones, the applicability of AG \u00b6 31(a) depends on whether the crime he committed\nconstitutes a serious crime. Under the state law where the conduct occurred, \u201ca person\ncommits sexual abuse by intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual contact with any\nperson who is fifteen or more years of age without the consent of that person . . .\u201d\n(A.R.S. \u00a7 13-404(A) If Applicant\u2019s conduct constituted sexual abuse, it would be\nsufficiently serious to trigger AG \u00b6 31(a).\nConversely, disorderly conduct under relevant state law encompasses minor\nconduct such as \u201cengaging in fighting,\u201d making \u201cunreasonable noise,\u201d or engaging in \u201ca\nprotracted commotion.\u201d (A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2904) If Applicant\u2019s conduct merely constituted\ndisorderly conduct, AG \u00b6 31(a) would not apply.\nDepartment Counsel argues that AG \u00b6 31(a) is applicable because Applicant was\narrested for a felony offense and later pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. (Tr. 109-110)\nThis analysis is incorrect. Under DOHA jurisprudence, a guilty plea is, at most, evidence\nthat Applicant engaged in conduct covered by the statute to which he pleaded guilty, not\nthe statute he was initially charged with violating. (ISCR Case No. 93-0369 (App. Bd.\nOctober 26, 1994 at 3)) Consequently, Applicant\u2019s guilty plea to the crime of disorderly\nconduct does not trigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(a). \nInstead, for AG \u00b6 31(a) to apply, there must be substantial evidence that\nApplicant engaged in sexual misconduct as alleged in the SOR. (Id.) Applicant provided\ncontradictory accounts of what happened in the car. When first questioned by the\npolice, he denied any touching of his girlfriend\u2019s daughter\u2019s breast. After the police\nplayed a recording of a conversation with the girl in which he admitted the touching, he\ncorroborated her account of the incident. During the DOHA investigative process, he\nacknowledged the touching, but characterized it as accidental. Given these\ncontradictions, I conclude Applicant touched his girlfriend\u2019s daughter\u2019s breast\nintentionally, and that this conduct constituted sexual abuse under state law. AG \u00b6 31(a)\n\n5\napplies. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered his acknowledgment of the\nweekly spankings he administered to the girl on her bare bottom.\nApplicant completed counseling and received a favorable prognosis. He no\nlonger has any contact with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s daughter. Also, he has a good\nemployment record. AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding, but not limited to the passage of time without a recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training, or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement,\u201d applies.\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nUnder this guideline, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 12). Applicant\u2019s touching of his then-girlfriend\u2019s daughter\u2019s breast\nconstituted sexual abuse under state law. Consequently, AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior\nof a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted,\u201d 13(c), \u201csexual\nbehavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d\nand 13(d), \u201csexual behavior . . . that reflects a lack of discretion or judgment,\u201d apply.\nApplicant notified his employer of the incident. He voluntarily attended counseling\nwith a psychologist who specializes in treating sexual abusers. He was highly engaged\nin counseling and received a favorable prognosis upon its conclusion. Applicant no\nlonger has any contact with the girl. He has not engaged in any similar conduct since\nthe incident. AG \u00b6 14(b), \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago . . . that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 14(c), \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s initial falsification to the authorities when asked\nwhether he inappropriately touched his then-girlfriend\u2019s daughter triggers the application\nof AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority,\nor other official government representative.\u201d\nApplicant admitted the conduct after listening to a police recording of his\nconversation with his then-girlfriend\u2019s daughter. Since then, he has repeatedly\nattempted to minimize it by characterizing it as accidental. This lack of candor renders\nany of the mitigating conditions inapplicable.  \n\n6\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a), as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s inappropriate touching of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s teenage daughter\nrepresents a serious lapse in judgment. Since then, Applicant successfully completed\ncounseling and served his probation without incident. He no longer is in contact with\neither his ex-girlfriend or her daughter. Consequently, it is unlikely such conduct will\nrecur. I remain concerned, however, about Applicant\u2019s lack of candor. He did not admit\nthe inappropriate touching until the police replayed a recording of a conversation with\nhis ex-girlfriend\u2019s daughter where he admitted it and asked her not to tell her mother.\nLater, during the security clearance investigation, he began characterizing the touching\nas accidental. This lack of candor makes him an unacceptable candidate for a security\nclearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) on \nApril 3, 2007. On July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. DOHA acted under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nJanuary 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nOn September 17, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. On June 1, \n2010, he requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The \n1 \n \nDecember 21, 2010\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 8, 2010. The FORM \ncontained documents identified as Items 1 through 12.

Applicant received the file on \nAugust 2, 2010. His response to the FORM was due on September 1, 2010. He did not \nfile any additional information or objections within the required time period. The case \nwas assigned to me for a decision on December 15, 2010. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nIn the FORM, the Government pointed out and provided corrections for four \nminor typographical errors in SOR allegations 1.c., 1.d., 1.j., and 1.p.  Applicant did not \nobject to the Government\u2019s corrections to the record. (See FORM, fn. 11.) \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR comprises 17 allegations that raise trustworthiness concerns under AG \nF, Financial Considerations. The SOR alleges failure to file Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2003 through 2006. The SOR also alleges financial \ndelinquencies totaling approximately $8,775. (Item 1.) \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he failed to file Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2003 through 2006. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.) He also \nadmitted 13 of the 15 SOR allegations of delinquent debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. through 1.g.; 1.i. \nthrough 1.k.; and 1.m. through 1.q.). He denied two allegations of delinquent debt (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.l.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and divorced. It is unclear from the record whether he \nhas dependent children.1 On the SF 85P he filed in April 2007, Applicant listed \nemployment since 2006 as a customer interactive agent for a government contractor. \nApplicant seeks eligibility for access to sensitive information for the first time. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant has a high school diploma and attended a community college for \napproximately one academic year. From 1999 to December 2005, he was employed as \nan assistant manager in a pharmacy. In December 2004, Applicant became ill with a \nlife-threatening illness. (Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator about his finances on March 13, 2008. He reported a history of financial \ndifficulties. Applicant told the OPM investigator that in about 2003, he was served with a \ntax lien for failure to pay his Federal income taxes from 2000 and 2001.2 In 2003, $300 \na month was garnished from Applicant\u2019s wages to satisfy the Federal tax lien. After two \n \n1 In his personal subject interview, Applicant stated he and his former wife did not know they could claim \ntax deductions for their children. Applicant did not list any children on his SF 85P. (Item 6 at 5; Item 5.) \n \n2 Applicant told the OPM investigator he was not sure whether the Federal tax lien covered tax years \n2000 and 2001 or 2001 and 2002. (Item 6 at 4.) \n\n3 \n \n                                                          \nor three months of the garnishment, Applicant contacted the IRS and entered into an \nagreement to pay $150 a month to satisfy the Federal tax lien.3 Applicant made the \nmonthly payments of $150 to the IRS until December 2004, when he became seriously \nill and was unable to continue payments because he could not work full time. He did not \nrecall whether he contacted the IRS to inform the agency of his changed circumstances. \nHe does not know the balance due on his 2003 tax lien. Applicant told the OPM \ninvestigator he intended to contact the IRS to make arrangements to resume payments. \nHe stated that he had filed his income taxes since 2001 or 2002. (Item 6 at 5, 6.) \n \n \nAt his March 2008 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant stated that his \nfinancial situation was improving: he had stable employment and medical insurance. He \nwas attempting to pay off his old debts, and he told the investigator he was exploring \ndebt consolidation with a credit counseling agency. (Item 6 at 7.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in December 2008, Applicant, in a sworn \nstatement, admitted that he had not filed his Federal or state income tax returns for \n2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. He further stated his intent to rectify his tax delinquencies \nas soon as possible. Nothing in the record suggests that Applicant has taken action to \nfile his delinquent Federal and state tax returns for 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. (Item \n7.)  \n \n \n \n \nThe two debts that Applicant denied are listed on his credit reports of May 2, \n2009, and September 12, 2007. He failed to provide documentation to establish that he \nhad paid, settled, or had payment plans in place for the 13 delinquent debts he \nadmitted. Four of Applicant\u2019s debts are for less than $200 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.f., 1.k., and \n1.q.). The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. is for $21. Additionally, he provided no \ndocumentation to establish that he was not responsible for the two delinquent debts he \ndenied. While Applicant told the OPM investigator that he was exploring debt \nconsolidation and consumer credit counseling, nothing in the record suggests that he \ncompleted credit counseling. (Item 1; Item 4; Item 6; Item 9; Item 11.)  \n                                                     Burden of Proof \n \nThe Government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. To meet its burden, the Government must establish by substantial evidence a \nprima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for an applicant \nto have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no one has a right to a \nsecurity clearance, the applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion. The \"clearly \nconsistent with the national interest\" standard compels resolution of any reasonable \ndoubt about an applicant's suitability for access to sensitive information in favor of \nprotecting national security. \n \n3 On April 3, 2009, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant signed a statement affirming that he \nhad read the summary of the interview and found it to be true and correct. He made no changes, \ncorrections, or revisions to the investigator\u2019s summary. (Item 6 at 3-4.) \n \n \n\n4 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThe guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, the administrative judge must apply the guidelines in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \n\n5 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b619 provides three financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise security concerns and may be disqualifying in this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 19(c), \nAa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may also raise trustworthiness concerns. \nAdditionally, under AG \u00b6 19(g) \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns as required . . .\u201d raises potentially disqualifying trustworthiness concerns.  \n \n In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted.) Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his \ncredit reports, his SF 85P, his interview with the OPM investigator, and his SOR \nresponse. In 2000 or 2001, Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax return. In \n2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, he also failed to file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns. In his personal subject interview, Applicant told the investigator that he had filed \nhis Federal income tax returns since 2001 or 2002. Moreover, Applicant accumulated \ndelinquent debt and was unable to pay or satisfy his financial obligations. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise financial considerations disqualifying conditions identified at AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(g). \n \n\n6 \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the \ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nApplicant=s financial delinquencies began in at least 2000, and they have continued to \nthe present. He has not resolved his financial delinquencies, and they are likely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to satisfy his delinquent debts over a period of at least ten years casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  Accordingly, I \nconclude that AG \u00b620(a) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), mitigation can occur where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant reported that \nin December 2004, he was stricken with a life-threatening illness and was unable to \nwork full time. However, the record reflects that while his illness prevented him from \npaying his 2003 Federal tax lien, he did not resume payment when he regained his \nhealth and had stable employment. Applicant has been steadily employed for several \nyears, and yet he appears to have made no effort the resolve his many financial \ndelinquencies and file his delinquent tax returns. He offered no explanation for his \nfailure to resolve or settle his financial delinquencies and file his delinquent Federal and \nstate tax returns even after he regained his health and had steady employment. I \nconclude that while he experienced financial problems in part because of a medical \nsituation beyond his control, he failed to act responsibly in identifying and resolving his \nfinancial delinquencies. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies only in part to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Nothing in the record establishes that Applicant has received \nfinancial counseling or that he has otherwise taken positive action to resolve his \nfinancial problems. Moreover, nothing in the record establishes that he has made good-\nfaith efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand 20(d) do not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (e) and 20 (f) are not \nraised by the facts of this case.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. His \nfinancial delinquencies occurred repeatedly over a period of at least ten years, \nsuggesting lack of motivation or inability to learn to manage his financial commitments \nresponsibly. While his illness impacted his ability to pay his debts for a period of time, \nhe also experienced financial difficulties prior to his illness. During his interview with the \nOPM investigator, he stated that he intended to take action to pay his delinquent tax lien \nand other delinquent debts. However, he failed to do so. Moreover, there is no record \nevidence that Applicant attempted to resolve even the four modest debts of under $200 \non the SOR. In determining an individual's security worthiness, the Government cannot \nrely on the possibility that an applicant might resolve his or her outstanding debts at \nsome future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999). It is also well \nsettled that failure to discharge debts over a period of time constitutes a continuing \ncourse of conduct that raises concerns about an applicant\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. ISCR Case No 07-10575 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul 3, 2008).    \n \nThe record reflects that Applicant has been steadily employed for over three \nyears. He provided no documentation to show that he had paid or had payment plans in \nplace to satisfy his delinquent debts. He failed to file his delinquent Federal and state \nincome tax returns after asserting he would do so. He failed to demonstrate that his \nfinancial problems will not continue to be a trustworthiness concern in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.q.: Against Applicant \n \n \n                                                Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, 40 years old, has been a custodian for a defense contractor since 2007. He has also worked as a bartender since 1995. He married for the first time in 1994, and divorced in 1997. He remarried in 2001, and divorced in 2005. He has seven children, ranging in age from 2 years to 20 years old (Item 5). Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports show that Applicant's debts began to become delinquent in 2002. His credit bureau reports of May 2008 and January 2009 show three judgments, two of which were filed in 2002, and one in 2003. Other listed delinquencies include two medical debts, three telephone company debts, a utility company debt, a credit card debt, an automobile loan, and unpaid child support (Items 8 and 9). The SOR debts amount to $34,550. Applicant admitted all the debts, except \u00b61.a., which lists a $590 debt and subsequent judgment related to rental property.

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct. Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \nOn April 25, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required as part of his \nemployment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request (Item 5). \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \nOn March 17, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nAugust 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). The SOR was issued pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 19, 2009. He submitted a signed, \nnotarized Answer to the SOR, and requested a decision without a hearing. DOHA \nDepartment Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM),3 dated May 7, 2009, \nin support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. A copy of the FORM, with the \nsupporting government evidence, was forwarded to Applicant by letter dated July 29, \n2009. Applicant was given 30 days from the date he received the FORM to file a \nresponse, but did not respond (Items 1, 3, 4; FORM). \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each allegation under Guideline F, \nexcept allegation 1.a. Under Guideline E, he admitted allegations 2.a. through 2.d., with \nexplanation. The case was assigned to me on August 6, 2009, for an administrative \ndecision based on the record. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegation at SOR \u00b61.a. In his FORM, Department Counsel \nwithdrew a portion of the allegation in order to conform the allegation to the evidence. \nThe withdrawn portion reads, \u201cfor the removal of a washer and dryer from the landlord\u2019s \nproperty.\u201d The revised allegation 1.a. now reads: \n \na. You are indebted to [name] in the approximate amount of \n$590.00 and a judgment has been (sic) entered against you in \nabout August 2002. As of January 9, 2009, this debt had not \nbeen satisfied. \n \nAmong the government\u2019s exhibits are two sets of Interrogatories. The first, Item \n6, is dated October 31, 2008. It includes a report of Applicant's Subject Interview of \nJune 25, 2008, and a list of debts. It requests that Applicant verify if the report is \naccurate, and provide information and documentation as to his actions on each of the \ndebts. Item 6 does not include a response, signature, or notarization from Applicant. \nItem 7 is the second Interrogatory. It does not show the date it was mailed to Applicant, \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President \non December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and \nthey apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \n3 See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included nine documents (Items 1 - 9) in support \nof the government\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbut three pages are signed and dated by Applicant: page I-5 is dated January 4, 2009; \npages I-11 and 1-13 are dated November 21, 2008. Item 7 contains the same list of \nApplicant's debts, as well as hand-written notes at pages I-4, I-11 and I-12. However, \nwhile it does not include a copy of the report of Applicant's Subject Interview, it does \ninclude two pages on which Applicant responded that the report was accurate (pages I-\n4 and I-12).  \n \nEach of these Items is incomplete. Although Item 7 contains Applicant's \ncheckmark indicating that the Subject Interview report is accurate, that Item does not \ncontain a copy of the report. Item 6 contains the report, but no verification that Applicant \nadopts its contents. I find that these documents, as presented, are insufficient to show \nwhat documents Applicant received. I cannot determine whether Applicant, in fact, \nreceived, read, and adopted the Subject Interview report. Therefore, in this decision, I \ndo not rely on either Item in making findings of fact or drawing conclusions.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 40 years old, has been a custodian for a defense contractor since \n2007. He has also worked as a bartender since 1995. He married for the first time in \n1994, and divorced in 1997. He remarried in 2001, and divorced in 2005. He has seven \nchildren, ranging in age from 2 years to 20 years old (Item 5).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports show that Applicant's debts began to become \ndelinquent in 2002. His credit bureau reports of May 2008 and January 2009 show three \njudgments, two of which were filed in 2002, and one in 2003. Other listed delinquencies \ninclude two medical debts, three telephone company debts, a utility company debt, a \ncredit card debt, an automobile loan, and unpaid child support (Items 8 and 9). The \nSOR debts amount to $34,550. Applicant admitted all the debts, except \u00b61.a., which \nlists a $590 debt and subsequent judgment related to rental property. Applicant did not \nexplain the reason for his denial.  \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Appellant wrote that he \u201ctook a step to file bankruptcy\u201d \nand that he had begun working at a second job, both in an attempt to resolve his debts \n(Item 4). He provided no documentation to show that a bankruptcy petition has been \nfiled or to support the fact that he might be working at a second job. The file also shows \nno indication that Applicant undertook any kind of consumer counseling.  \n \n \nWhen he completed his security clearance application in April 2008, Applicant did \nnot disclose one of the two alleged judgments, one repossession, or any of his \ndelinquent debts (Items 1, 4, and 5). In his Answer, he admitted to the falsification \nalleged at \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.d. of the SOR, but explained that he \u201cmisread the questions \non the questionnaire and take full responsibilities for my actions.\u201d (Item 4)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines \nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this \ncase, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration \nof the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence contained in the FORM raises two potentially applicable \ndisqualifying conditions. AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies. \nApplicant has allowed delinquencies to accrue and remain unresolved to the point \nwhere he carries a significant debt load of approximately $34,000. AG \u00b619(c) (a history \nof not meeting financial obligations) also applies because Applicant\u2019s debts, which \nstarted becoming delinquent around 2002, still appear in his credit bureau reports and \nremain unpaid as of the date of his Answer, showing a seven-year history of failing to \nmeet financial obligations. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following conditions that can potentially mitigate security \nconcerns are relevant:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot be applied. Applicant\u2019s debts did not occur in the distant past, \nbecause the debts are still delinquent. Moreover, his failure to make any attempt to \nresolve his financial situation casts doubt on his reliability. The record contains no \nindication that unforeseen circumstances delayed or prevented Applicant from dealing \nwith his debts, which negates any mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant did not indicate in his Answer that he sought professional guidance or \nconsumer counseling to assist him in resolving his delinquencies. He did note that he \nhad taken \u201ca step to file bankruptcy and try to resolve these (sic) financial situation.\u201d \nAlthough bankruptcy would be a legitimate path to resolve his debts, Applicant provided \nno further information or documentation, and it cannot be determined whether he, in \nfact, has taken has taken such steps. A stated intention or promise of future action is \ninsufficient to show that an applicant will take that action, nor does it negate this \nApplicant's past record of failure to respond to his debts.8 Mitigation is not available \nunder AG \u00b6 20(c).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is also unavailable, as Applicant has not paid or set up a payment \nplan for any debt. He admitted in his Answer that the debts alleged in the SOR were \nunpaid as of January 2009, and included no documentation to show that he had paid \nany since that date. As none of the mitigating conditions apply, I find against the \nApplicant on Guideline F. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) is relevant. When he completed his security clearance application in \nApril 2008, Applicant failed to disclose a repossession, a judgment related to a \nmotorcycle, or any of his debts that had been delinquent since 2002 (Item 5). Applicant \nadmits the allegations of falsification, but explains in his Answer that he misunderstood \nthe questions (Item 4). Applicant did disclose one judgment, alleged at \u00b6 1.a., in the \namount of $590. However, he failed to disclose a much larger judgment for more than \n$4,000, as well as a repossession involving a debt of approximately $5,000, and 11 \nother debts, all of which total approximately $34,000. His statement that he did not \nunderstand the questions relating to repossession and past-due debts is not credible, as \nhe understood the question relating to unpaid judgments. Applicant's disclosure of a \nrelatively small debt misrepresented the true extent of the debt load he carries. I \nconclude that the omission was intentional, and that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \n \n8 ISCR Case No. 98-0445 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 1999). See also, ISCR Case No. 96-0544 at 5 (May 12, \n1997).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, two factors could potentially mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct: AG \n\u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(c) (the \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Neither condition \napplies. The record contains no evidence that Applicant attempted to inform the \ngovernment of his true financial situation. In addition, Applicant\u2019s falsification cannot be \nconsidered insignificant under AG \u00b6 17(c). Revealing one debt of approximately $600, \nwhen his past-due debts actually amount to more than $34,000, is a significant \nmisrepresentation that cannot be considered minor. The government relies on \ninformation provided by Applicants, and deliberate falsification both undermines the \nsecurity clearance process, and casts serious doubts on the Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. \nI find against Applicant on Guideline E. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence Applicant is 46 \nyears old and presumed to be a mature, responsible adult.  \n \n \nApplicant is an adult 40 years of age, who is assumed to be mature and \nresponsible. He has accrued a significant amount of debt since 2002, but during the \npast seven years, he has not taken steps to resolve it. Applicant stated that he had \ntaken a step toward filing for bankruptcy, and had begun a second job. But without \nevidence to support these claims, they do little to assure that the debts will be resolved. \nIn addition, Applicant's failure to disclose his debts on his security clearance application \nindicates a lack of trustworthiness that is incompatible with the high standards required \nof those who are granted access to classified information. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts about his trustworthiness and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nreliability. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these \ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: - 1.n. \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: - 2.d. \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information.

He also failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his failure\nto disclose in his security clearance application that he used a controlled substance while\nhe possessed a top secret security clearance. \nOn December 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement) and E (personal\nconduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nApril 10, 2009\n\n Applicant wrote \u201cI Admit\u201d in response to the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 2.d and\n2\n2.e, but then went on to indicate he did not deliberately falsify the security clearance application he submitted\nin January 2008, but instead misunderstood the questions that were being asked.\n2\nJanuary 29, 2009. He admitted all SOR allegations except those alleged in subparagraphs\n2.d and 2. e, and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 18,\n2009, which was mailed to Applicant on February 19, 2009. Applicant was notified he had\n30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections thereto or any additional\ninformation he wanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on March\n2, 2009. He submitted one undated letter of recommendation in response to the FORM.\nOn March 11, 2009, Department Counsel indicated he did not object to the admissibility\nof the material submitted by Applicant. The case was assigned to me on March 16, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 22-year-old single man who has been employed as an electrician by\na defense contractor since January 2008. He graduated from high school in May 2005, and\nwas attending college at the time he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in January 2008. He held a number of jobs during and\nafter his high school years, most notably as an electrician working for a company that was\ncontracted to do work by a U. S. Government department in a foreign country.\n \nApplicant was granted a top secret security clearance during his employment in the\nforeign country. He worked in that country from January 2007 to October 2007. While\nworking in the foreign country, Applicant purchased hashish from a co-worker and used it\non a daily basis from July to October 2007. His use and purchase of the hashish was\ndiscovered and he was fired from his job as a result. Applicant also admits he used\nmarijuana about 100 times between 2005 and February 2008.\nIn the e-QIP he submitted in January 2008, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to a question\nasking if he had illegally used any controlled substance in the preceding seven years.\nHowever, in response to the follow-up question that asked him to provide details of his\nillegal use of controlled substances he only disclosed the 2007 use of hashish in the\nforeign country. He failed to disclose his previous and continuing use of marijuana.\nApplicant possessed a security clearance when he used hashish. However, in the 2008 e-\nQIP he submitted, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question asking if he had ever illegally used a\ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance. \nAs noted previously, Applicant claimed he did not deliberately falsify the e-QIP, but\nrather misunderstood the questions that were being asked. Specifically, he claims he\nsomehow misunderstood the question asking about illegal drug use in the preceding seven\nyears to be only inquiring about his use of hashish in the foreign country and that he was\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n3\nconfused by the punctuation in the question asking about his illegal use of a controlled\nsubstance while in possession of a security clearance and thought the question was only\nasking about drug abuse by police, prosecutors and court officials. In the same SOR\nresponse he went on to state: \u201cWhile filling out the Equip [sic] I was just scared to admit\nmy past drug use. . . . and I felt that I would not have gotten my clearance had I told the\nwhole truth. I was being stupid and thought I could work around the system.\u201d \n       Applicant appears to attribute his falsification of the e-QIP to youthful indiscretion. He\nasserts he has matured significantly as the result of a serious motorcycle accident that left\nhim disabled for about seven months, that he is a changed person, and that he plans to\nget married. He does not comment about why he continued to illegally use a controlled\nsubstance either after he lost his job in October 2007, or after he submitted the e-QIP in\nJanuary 2008.        \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines H (drug involvement)\nand E (personal conduct), with their disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most\nrelevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden\nof proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of\n6\nthe evidence.\u201d  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n7\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\nApplicant illegally purchased and used hashish on a regular basis between July and\nOctober 2007. He possessed a top secret security clearance and was working in a foreign\ncountry under a contract with a U.S. Government department while using the hashish. He\nalso abused marijuana about 100 times between 2005 and February 2008, including after\nhe submitted an e-QIP in connection with his current employment. Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 25(a): any drug abuse; DC 25(c): illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase,\nsale, or distribution; and DC 25(g): any illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance apply.\nAt best, it has been only slightly more than a year since Applicant last illegally used\na controlled substance. His abuse of controlled substances occurred while he possessed\na security clearance; while he was working under a contract with a department of the U.S.\nGovernment; while he was working in a foreign country; and after he submitted an e-QIP\nin connection with his current employment. I have considered all mitigating conditions, and\nthe above factors preclude finding that any mitigating condition applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\n\n5\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not listing his extensive marijuana use between 2005 and\nFebruary 2008 in the e-QIP he submitted is not credible. It is impossible to understand how\nhe could have misread the applicable question to only be asking about his abuse of a\ncontrolled substance while he was in the foreign country. His explanation is also completely\ncontradicted by his later acknowledgment in his SOR response that he was afraid admitting\nhis drug abuse would jeopardize his chance of obtaining a security clearance. DC 16(a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personal\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, of similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.\nApplicant\u2019s use of hashish while possessing a security clearance and working in a\nforeign country for a U.S. Government department and his termination from that\nemployment as a consequence of his drug abuse create independent security concerns\nunder DC 16(e): personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the\nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country,\nengaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal\nin the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign\nsecurity or intelligence service or other group. \n \nIn the e-QIP, Applicant disclosed his employment in the foreign country, the\napplication he submitted for a security clearance in connection with that employment, and\nthat the employment was terminated as a consequence of his use of hashish in that foreign\ncountry. Thus, his explanation for failing to disclose his use of a controlled substance while\npossessing a security clearance is corroborated by the information he did disclose in the\ne-QIP and does not create a separate security concern.\nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including Applicant\u2019s age, the period of time that has elapsed since his last reported\nuse of a controlled substance, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1\nthrough \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying conditions. Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns caused by his abuse of controlled substances and\nthe related personal conduct issues that arise therefrom. He has not overcome the case\nagainst him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 22-year-old single man who has been employed as an electrician by a defense contractor since January 2008. He graduated from high school in May 2005, and was attending college at the time he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) in January 2008. He held a number of jobs during and after his high school years, most notably as an electrician working for a company that was contracted to do work by a U. S. Government department in a foreign country. Applicant was granted a top secret security clearance during his employment in the foreign country. He worked in that country from January 2007 to October 2007. While working in the foreign country, Applicant purchased hashish from a co-worker and used it on a daily basis from July to October 2007. His use and purchase of the hashish was discovered and he was fired from his job as a result. Applicant also admits he used marijuana about 100 times between 2005 and February 2008. In the e-QIP he submitted in January 2008, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to a question asking if he had illegally used any controlled substance in the preceding seven years. 3 However, in response to the follow-up question that asked him to provide details of his illegal use of controlled substances he only disclosed the 20",

He also failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his failure\nto disclose in his security clearance application that he used a controlled substance while\nhe possessed a top secret security clearance. \nOn December 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement) and E (personal\nconduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMay 26, 2009\n\n Applicant wrote \u201cI Admit\u201d in response to the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 2.d and\n2\n2.e, but then went on to indicate he did not deliberately falsify the security clearance application he submitted\nin January 2008, but instead misunderstood the questions that were being asked.\n2\nJanuary 29, 2009. He admitted all SOR allegations except those alleged in subparagraphs\n2.d and 2. e, and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 18,\n2009, which was mailed to Applicant on February 19, 2009. Applicant was notified he had\n30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections thereto or any additional\ninformation he wanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on March\n2, 2009. He submitted one undated letter of recommendation in response to the FORM.\nOn March 11, 2009, Department Counsel indicated he did not object to the admissibility\nof the material submitted by Applicant. The case was assigned to me on March 16, 2009.\nProcedural Matters\nOn April 10, 2009, I issued an unfavorable decision in this case. On April 13, 2009,\nI received an e-mail from Department Counsel stating that he had received additional\ndocuments from Applicant that had inadvertently not been included in the file when it was\nforwarded to the hearing office for issuance of a decision. An expedited appeal thereafter\nensued and the case was remanded to me for issuance of a new decision. I have marked\nthe two documents and cover letter from Applicant as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-3 and\nmade them a part of the record in this case. The e-mail from Department Counsel has\nbeen marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and is included in the file.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 22-year-old single man who has been employed as an electrician by\na defense contractor since January 2008. He graduated from high school in May 2005, and\nwas attending college at the time he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in January 2008. He held a number of jobs during and\nafter his high school years, most notably as an electrician working for a company that was\ncontracted to do work by a U. S. Government department in a foreign country.\n \nApplicant was granted a top secret security clearance during his employment in the\nforeign country. He worked in that country from January 2007 to October 2007. While\nworking in the foreign country, Applicant purchased hashish from a co-worker and used it\non a daily basis from July to October 2007. His use and purchase of the hashish was\ndiscovered and he was fired from his job as a result. Applicant also admits he used\nmarijuana about 100 times between 2005 and February 2008.\nIn the e-QIP he submitted in January 2008, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to a question\nasking if he had illegally used any controlled substance in the preceding seven years.\n\n3\nHowever, in response to the follow-up question that asked him to provide details of his\nillegal use of controlled substances he only disclosed the 2007 use of hashish in the\nforeign country. He failed to disclose his previous and continuing use of marijuana.\nApplicant possessed a security clearance when he used hashish. However, in the 2008 e-\nQIP he submitted, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question asking if he had ever illegally used a\ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance. \nAs noted previously, Applicant claimed he did not deliberately falsify the e-QIP, but\nrather misunderstood the questions that were being asked. Specifically, he claims he\nsomehow misunderstood the question asking about illegal drug use in the preceding seven\nyears to be only inquiring about his use of hashish in the foreign country and that he was\nconfused by the punctuation in the question asking about his illegal use of a controlled\nsubstance while in possession of a security clearance and thought the question was only\nasking about drug abuse by police, prosecutors and court officials. In the same SOR\nresponse he went on to state: \u201cWhile filling out the Equip [sic] I was just scared to admit\nmy past drug use. . . . and I felt that I would not have gotten my clearance had I told the\nwhole truth. I was being stupid and thought I could work around the system.\u201d \n       Applicant appears to attribute his falsification of the e-QIP to youthful indiscretion. He\nasserts he has matured significantly as the result of a serious motorcycle accident that left\nhim disabled for about seven months, that he is a changed person, and that he plans to\nget married. He does not comment about why he continued to illegally use a controlled\nsubstance either after he lost his job in October 2007, or after he submitted the e-QIP in\nJanuary 2008.    \nApplicant submitted three letters of recommendation. One letter is from a National\nGuard Command Sergeant Major who has known Applicant for over seven years. He\nattests to Applicant\u2019s professionalism and positive attitude toward his employers and\nemployees. He asserts that Applicant is able to make sound judgments without supervision\nand that he sets an excellent example for his peers.\nThe other two letters of recommendation are from the vice president of operations\nat Applicant\u2019s current place of employment and the project manager on the job to which\nApplicant is currently assigned. Both individuals are aware of the reason Applicant\u2019s\napplication for a security clearance was denied. They express their opinions that Applicant\nhas matured significantly. They believe he has proven himself to be a dependable and\nhard working member of their team and that he has become a valuable asset to their\ncompany and the project to which he is assigned.        \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines H (drug involvement)\nand E (personal conduct), with their disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most\nrelevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden\nof proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of\n6\nthe evidence.\u201d  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n7\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\n\n5\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\nApplicant illegally purchased and used hashish on a regular basis between July and\nOctober 2007. He possessed a top secret security clearance and was working in a foreign\ncountry under a contract with a U.S. Government department while using the hashish. He\nalso abused marijuana about 100 times between 2005 and February 2008, including after\nhe submitted an e-QIP in connection with his current employment. Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 25(a): any drug abuse; DC 25(c): illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase,\nsale, or distribution; and DC 25(g): any illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance apply.\nAt best, it has been only slightly more than a year since Applicant last illegally used\na controlled substance. His abuse of controlled substances occurred while he possessed\na security clearance; while he was working under a contract with a department of the U.S.\nGovernment; while he was working in a foreign country; and after he submitted an e-QIP\nin connection with his current employment. I have considered all mitigating conditions, and\nthe above factors preclude finding that any mitigating condition applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not listing his extensive marijuana use between 2005 and\nFebruary 2008 in the e-QIP he submitted is not credible. It is impossible to understand how\nhe could have misread the applicable question to only be asking about his abuse of a\ncontrolled substance while he was in the foreign country. His explanation is also completely\ncontradicted by his later acknowledgment in his SOR response that he was afraid admitting\nhis drug abuse would jeopardize his chance of obtaining a security clearance. DC 16(a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personal\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, of similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.\nApplicant\u2019s use of hashish while possessing a security clearance and working in a\nforeign country for a U.S. Government department and his termination from that\nemployment as a consequence of his drug abuse create independent security concerns\nunder DC 16(e): personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the\nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country,\nengaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal\nin the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign\nsecurity or intelligence service or other group. \n\n6\n \nIn the e-QIP, Applicant disclosed his employment in the foreign country, the\napplication he submitted for a security clearance in connection with that employment, and\nthat the employment was terminated as a consequence of his use of hashish in that foreign\ncountry. Thus, his explanation for failing to disclose his use of a controlled substance while\npossessing a security clearance is corroborated by the information he did disclose in the\ne-QIP and does not create a separate security concern.\nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including Applicant\u2019s age, the period of time that has elapsed since his last reported\nuse of a controlled substance, the letters of recommendation he submitted, the whole\nperson concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the\napplicable disqualifying conditions. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns\ncaused by his abuse of controlled substances and the related personal conduct issues that\narise therefrom. He has not overcome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate\nburden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\na security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings: Applicant used marijuana from 1969 to 2001 and\nfrom 2004 to 2006, with a total usage of 30 to 40 times.  Applicant used marijuana while holding\na security clearance during various periods from 1980 until 2006.  He terminated his employment\nin 2004.  One of the reasons for his leaving was his refusal to participate in his company\u2019s drug\ntesting program.  Beginning in 1991 and continuing to 2008, Applicant has repeatedly misstated the\nextent of his illegal drug use in questionnaires provided to the government, and in interviews with\nauthorized investigators.  On one occasion, Applicant also falsified his answer to a question\nconcerning leaving a job under unfavorable circumstances.  \nThe Judge concluded that: Applicant repeatedly lied to the Government about the extent of\nhis drug use over a period of 16 years on four questionnaires and in three interviews.  Applicant\nargues that he is telling the truth now, that his drug use was not all that serious, and that he has been\notherwise trustworthy.  It is obvious that the Applicant is not a reliable or believable reporter of the\nfacts concerning his own life.  Applicant also used marijuana while holding a security clearance.\nNone of this conduct is mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s marijuana uses were the actions of a mature person.\nIf Applicant\u2019s job did not require him to have a security clearance, it is likely that he would continue\nsuch use into the future.  He is commended for finally being honest with the Defense Department\nabout his drug use.  However, insufficient time has passed to show that he truly intends to stop\nmarijuana use.\n \nApplicant contends that the matters alleged in the SOR are not typical of his nature.  He\nstates that he is hard working, reliable and knowledgeable and the adverse information in the\nclearance decision does not accurately reflect who he is as an individual.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do\nnot establish error on the part of the Judge.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\n\n3\nfactors.  He adequately discussed why the disqualifying conduct established under Guidelines E and\nH was not mitigated.  \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On June 23, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nand Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on July 15, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non August 28, 2009. I received the case assignment on September 2, 2009.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 14, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on October 21, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through E, also without objection. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing on October 30, 2009. The record closed on October 21,\n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 58, and is a high school graduate.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)\nThe Government alleges under Guideline E that the Applicant is ineligible for a\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Government during the\nclearance screening process, as well as engaging in conduct showing questionable\njudgment.  \nThe Government alleges under Guideline H that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used illegal drugs.\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under both guideline, but denied that\nhis conduct showed questionable judgment or a lack of candor. His admissions are\nhereby deemed findings of fact. \n2.a.\nApplicant used marijuana from 1969 to 2001, and from 2004 to September\n2006. Applicant estimates that he used marijuana in total about 30 to 40 times. \n2.b.\nApplicant tested positive for marijuana in 2001 during a random drug test.\n2.c.\nAs a result of that positive drug test in 2001, he was required to attend\ndrug counseling.\n1.h. and 2.d. Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance during\nvarious periods from 1980 until 2006.\n1.i. and 2.e. Applicant terminated his employment in about October 2004. One\nof the reasons for leaving was his refusal to participate in his company\u2019s drug testing\nprogram. This allegation will be further discussed under 1.c., below.\nBeginning in 1991, and continuing to 2008, Applicant has repeatedly misstated\nthe extent of his illegal drug use in questionnaires provided to the Government, and in\ninterviews with authorized investigators. For ease of discussion, the remaining\nallegations under this paragraph will be examined in chronological order, and not in the\norder alleged in the SOR.\n\nApplicant also responded \u201cNo,\u201d to question 28 of Government Exhibit 2, which asked whether he had \u201cEVER\n1\nillegally used a controlled substance . . . while possessing a security clearance.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n3\n1.g. \nApplicant filled out a Government questionnaire in October 1991. He\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 20, which asked if he had ever tried or used any illegal\ndrugs, including marijuana. (Government Exhibit 4.) This was a false answer concerning\na relevant question about the Applicant\u2019s drug use. (Transcript at 21-23.)\n1.f. \nApplicant filled out a second Government questionnaire in May 1993. He\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 22, which asked if he had ever tried or used any illegal\ndrugs, including marijuana. (Government Exhibit 3.) This was also a false answer\nconcerning a relevant question about the Applicant\u2019s drug use. (Transcript at 23.)\n1.e. \nApplicant filled out a third Government questionnaire in July 2000. He\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 27, which asked if he had used any illegal drugs, including\nmarijuana since the age of 16 or in the last seven years, whichever was shorter.\n(Government Exhibit 2.) This was also a false answer concerning a relevant question\nabout the Applicant\u2019s drug use. (Transcript at 23-24.)1\n1.d. \nApplicant filled out a fourth Government questionnaire in September 2007.\nHe answered \u201cYes,\u201d to Question 24, which asked if he had used any illegal drugs,\nincluding marijuana since the age of 16 or in the last seven years, whichever was\nshorter. (Government Exhibit 1.) He went on to say that he had used marijuana between\nJuly and August 2001. This was also a false answer concerning a relevant question in\nthat it severely understated the true extent of Applicant\u2019s drug use.\n1.c.\nGovernment Exhibit 1 at Question 22 asks Applicant if, in the last seven\nyears, he had been fired from a job, quit after being told he would be fired, left a job by\nmutual agreement after allegations of misconduct, left a job by mutual agreement after\nallegations of unsatisfactory performance, or left a job for other reasons under\nunfavorable circumstances. Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d In fact, Applicant had left\nemployment in October 2004 because he had refused to participate in his company\u2019s\ndrug testing program, as set forth in 1.i. and 2.e.\nApplicant admits that he quit his job, in part, because he refused to participate in\nthe drug testing program, knowing he would be terminated if he did not so participate.\nApplicant also argues that what he did, and why he did it, did not come under the\npurview of Question 22. (Applicant\u2019s Answer at 3; Government Exhibit 5 at 11-13;\nTranscript at 30-31, 41-42.) However, at the hearing, Applicant eventually admitted,\n\u201cThe bottom line is this should have been put down on my Application, and it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n(Transcript at 30.)\n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator of the\nDefense Department on July 29, 2008. In that first interview, and for the first time,\nApplicant set forth what he has stated was his entire drug abuse history. (Government\nExhibit 5 at 4-7.)\n\n4\nApplicant recontacted the investigator on August 12, 2008, and asked for a\nreinterview. During this interview, he recanted much his July 29, 2008, interview. In\nparticular, he stated that he had lied about the extent of his drug use from 1970 to 2001,\nand 2004 to 2006. (Government Exhibit 5 at 7-8.)\nFinally, on August 13, 2008, Applicant contacted the interviewer yet again. At this\nlast interview he recanted his second statement and basically reaffirmed his first\nstatement. Applicant gave conflicting reasons for deciding to come forward. At this\ninterview, his drug use was described as follows:\n[Applicant] had smoked marijuana while in college in 1969-70, he\nhad smoked marijuana about 12 times between 1970 and the start of his\n2001 vacation, smoked marijuana daily while on his 1 week - 10 days\nvacation in 2001 just before his urinalysis, and he had smoked marijuana\na couple of times a year while out camping in 2005 and [2006], but none in\n2007 to present. (Government Exhibit 5 at 9.) (See Transcript at 31-35,\n39, 42-43.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly respected\nemployee. His current supervisor recommends Applicant for a security clearance,\nstating he is \u201cdedicated\u201d and \u201cdependable.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A.) (See Applicant\nExhibits B and C.)\nApplicant\u2019s last two \u201cEmployee Performance Evaluations\u201d were also submitted.\nHe received the highest ranking, \u201cExceeded Job Requirements.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits D\nand E.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\n\n5\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by the President in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nApplicant repeatedly lied to the Government about the extent of his drug use over\na period of 16 years, on four questionnaires and in three interviews. Applicant argues\nthat he is telling the truth now, that his drug use was not that serious, and that he has\nbeen otherwise trustworthy. It is obvious that the Applicant is not a reliable or believable\nreporter of the facts concerning his own life, making his arguments specious at best.\n\n6\nDisqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to this case, concerning:\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn addition, AG \u00b6 16(b) also applies, since he was \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in using marijuana while having a security clearance, and\nterminating employment rather than take a drug test, is also cognizable under this\nparagraph. Specifically, AG \u00b6 16(c):\ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.\nNone of the Mitigating Conditions apply to this case. Paragraph 1 is found\nagainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially\nconsidered the following: AG \u00b6 25(a) \u201cany drug abuse\u201d; \u00b6 25(b) \u201ctesting positive for\n\n7\nillegal drug use\u201d; and \u00b6 25(g) \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance.\u201d\nThe Applicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis, from 1969 until\napproximately 2006. While he stated an intent not to use drugs in the future because he\nneeded a security clearance, his statement was not clear and convincing. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 and especially\nconsidered the following: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or\navoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period\nof abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. \nThe evidence is clear that the Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana were the actions of a\nmature person. As of the date of the hearing, the Applicant was 58 and had been using\nmarijuana, albeit infrequently, for almost 30 years. If his job did not require him to have\na security clearance, it is likely that he would continue such use into the future. He is\ncommended for finally being honest with the Defense Department about his drug use.\nHowever, insufficient time has passed to show that he truly intends to stop marijuana\nuse. The Applicant did not provide a signed statement that he would not use marijuana\nin the future with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\n \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \n\n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional who has engaged in occasional marijuana use for many years.\nIn addition, he has a years long history of lying to the Government on essential security\nforms and in interviews. In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct. As set forth above, I find that\nthere have not been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). In addition, I\nfind that there is still potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG\n\u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug\ninvolvement as expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.e.\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq, Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDaniel C. Minutillo, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 23, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline\n\n2\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 8, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were\nsupported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge mis-weighed the evidence; and whether\nthe Judge erred in his application of the pertinent mitigating conditions.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a quality engineer for\na Defense contractor.  She immigrated to the U.S. and became a naturalized citizen.  She obtained\na degree in computer science from a U.S. university.  She is married and has two children.\nIn the mid-2000s Applicant was working for her current employer, though in a different state\nfrom her current place of employment.  She became friendly with a male colleague, A, and the\nrelationship between the two became a social one.  Applicant and her husband regularly invited A\nto their home, and A would give gifts to Applicant\u2019s children at holiday time and on birthdays.\nApplicant and A\u2019s relationship developed, and they would attend events such as concerts\ntogether, without the knowledge of A\u2019s husband.  Once, they traveled to the west coast for a\nshopping trip without A\u2019s husband knowing about it.  A began to make sexual advances upon\nApplicant and started calling her names, such as \u201cBabe.\u201d  Some of this took place in the workplace,\nand Applicant filed sexual harassment charges against A.\nIn December 2005 A asked Applicant if she would come by his residence to pick up presents\nfor Applicant\u2019s children.  When she did, Applicant and A had sexual relations.  Later, Applicant\nreported the incident as rape, claiming that A pushed himself on her.  However, subsequent\ninvestigation led authorities to the conclusion that rape did not occur, finding A\u2019s account of\nconsensual relations to be more credible.  Applicant ultimately pled guilty to false reporting, a\nmisdemeanor.  The Judge found that, in light of the totality of the record evidence, Applicant had\nfalsely reported the rape.\nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of her work performance, her\nconscientiousness, trustworthiness, and dependability.  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she falsely reported the rape, claiming that she\npled guilty only to avoid the stress of litigation.  We have examined the record evidence, including\nthe police report which the Judge considered in arriving at his finding of false reporting.  The report\nis detailed and internally consistent.  Its credibility was not seriously impugned at the hearing.  We\nhave also examined Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s findings are\nbased upon substantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)  \n\n3\nAlthough Applicant contends that the Judge did not properly weigh the evidence, we find no\nreason to disturb the manner in which he evaluated the evidence and judged the credibility of\nApplicant\u2019s testimony.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009).  \nApplicant notes that the Judge\u2019s statement, contained in the Findings portion of the decision,\nthat \u201c[b]ecause Applicant declined to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding her reported\naccount of the incident when pressed by the [police] and [the OPM investigator] . . . all of the\ncircumstances surrounding the . . .  incident may never be fully revealed.\u201d  Decision at 5.  Applicant\ncontends that the Judge should have resolved these ambiguities in favor of Applicant.  However, in\ncases brought under the Directive, once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).\nth\nAfter the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant\nto rebut or mitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard governing security\nclearance adjudications is in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d)  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2(b).\nAccordingly, we find no error in the challenged statement.    \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision, both as to its application of the mitigating\nconditions and the whole-person factors.  We conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael D. Hipple            \nMichael D.

Minutillo, Esquire\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn June 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992,  issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\ndetermination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determining whether a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 13, 2009, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 23, 2009.  The case was scheduled for hearing on\nSeptember 15, 2009.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or\ndeny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the government's\ncase consisted of five exhibits (exs. 1-5); Applicant relied on four witnesses (including\nJanuary 8, 2010\n\n \n2\nherself) and seven exhibits (exs. A-G).  The transcript (Tr.) was received September 26,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant asked for additional time to\nsupplement the record with character references.  For good cause shown, Applicant\nwas granted 10 days to supplement the record. The Government was afforded two days\nto respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with\ncharacter references.  The submissions are accepted as Applicant\u2019s exhibit H.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant was charged with false\nreporting (a Class 3 misdemeanor) in another state in January 2006, pleaded guilty to\nthe charge, and received a 12-month deferred sentence with conditions that she\ncomplete 48 hours of community service and send letters of apology. The same\nallegations were incorporated under Guideline E.\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied each of the allegations. She\nexplained that she pled guilty to a Class 3 misdemeanor on the advice of counsel, and\nonly did so to spare herself the trauma of reliving a rape experience and being\nportrayed as a female perpetrator at an emotionally charged trial. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old software quality engineer for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  Because Applicant denied each of the allegations, factual\nfindings are determined according to the from the evidentiary proofs of the parties. \nBackground\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea to pursue her education. Her\nparents and siblings are citizens and residents of South Korea. She applied for U.S.\ncitizenship in the 1980s and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1993 (see ex. 1 Tr. 59).\nShe enrolled in an accredited U.S. university in 1992 and was awarded a bachelor\u2019s of\nscience degree in computer science from the same school in May 1997 \nApplicant married in March 1988 and has two children from her marriage: ages\n11 and 14 (ex. 1). Following her graduation from college, Applicant worked continuously\nfor defense contractors over the ensuing five years (see ex. 1; Tr. 60-61).  Due to\nfamily-related issues, she resigned her position from her defense employer at the time\nin February 2006 (see exs. 1 and 3).  She remained unemployed for about a year\nbefore gaining employment with her previous employer in another city (see exs. 1 and\n3).  Since returning to her same employer, she has remained employed by this firm to\n\n \n3\nthe present, and currently works for the firm\u2019s State A facility.  Applicant has held a\nsecurity clearance for each of her positions (see ex. 3; Tr. 61-62). \nReported December 2005 rape incident and false reporting charges\nBetween October 2004 and February 2006, Applicant worked in the offices of\nher current employer in another state (State B).  During her tenure, in the firm\u2019s State B\nfacility, she befriended a work-colleague.  By June 2006, her association with this\ncolleague (A) had grown from a strictly professional relationship to a social one as well.\nShe even introduced A to her husband (see ex. 3), who soon came to treat A as a part\nof their family. Applicant and her husband regularly invited A to family dinners and other\nfunctions at their home (ex. 3).  In turn, A often purchased gifts for her children on their\nbirthdays and holidays (ex. 3).\n As her relationship with her colleague expanded, Applicant sometimes attended\nconcerts and other events alone with him, and without telling her husband.  On one\nparticular occasion in June 2005, she even traveled to the west coast with this\ncolleague on an overnight shopping trip without her husband\u2019s knowledge (see ex. 2).\nAt some point in their relationship, the colleague began making advances on Applicant.\nWhen she did not respond favorably to his romantic overtures, he began calling her\nderogatory names (such as \u201cBabe\u201d) in the work-place, which made working conditions\nin her office difficult for her (see ex. 3). She filed sexual harassment charges against A\nwith her human resources department and was assured that her problem would be\naddressed and resolved (ex. 3).\nApplicant\u2019s human resources department conducted its own investigation of A\u2019s\nreported harassment and interviewed her coworkers and colleagues at her place of\nbusiness (ex. 3). By early December 2005, her employer had completed its own\ninvestigation.  A, in turn, telephonically contacted Applicant in December 2005, and\ninformed her he could not bring Christmas presents for her children to her home, as he\nhad done in the past (see ex. 2).  He asked Applicant if she could come to his\nresidence to pick up the presents for her children (ex. 3).  She agreed, and went over to\nA\u2019s residence after work to pick up the presents (ex. 3). Applicant claimed that once she\nwas inside of A\u2019s apartment, A pushed himself aggressively against her and ignored her\npleas to cease (see ex. 3).  According to Applicant\u2019s police report account, A did not\nabide by her requests, and raped her (ex. 3; Tr.73).\nFollowing the incident in A\u2019s apartment, Applicant reported her account of events\nto her husband.  However, she did not promptly report the incident to local police, even\nthough, she had a cell phone with her at the time (ex. 2).  According to her accounts in\nthe police report of the incident, she awoke the next day and went shopping (see ex. 2).\nAfter informing A of her whereabouts, he joined her at the local mall and apologized to\nher profusely (ex. 2).  Several weeks later (in mid-January 2006), she filed a report with\nthe local police department, charging A with rape (see ex. 2; Tr. 73, 76-77, 86-87).\n\n \n4\nShortly after she filed rape charges against A with local police, Applicant\u2019s\nemployer instructed her to cease coming to work until further notice (see ex. 3). Once\nshe filed her report, A no longer tried to communicate with her.  \nSeveral days after she filed her police report, Applicant and her husband met\nwith a detective (D) at the local police department where she filed her report (see exs. 2\nand 3).  In this initial police interview, she described her colleague as a family friend and\ncoworker, but not a romantic partner, and declined to acknowledge any extra-marital\naffair with A (ex. 2).  At some point in the interview, Applicant received the detective\u2019s\napproval to audio record an interview with A (Tr. 78-79).  She was also offered the\nservices of a counselor, but declined (see ex. 3). \nFollowing the detective\u2019s suggestions, Applicant proceeded to interview her\ncolleague in the presence of the detective. However, before she could elicit any\ncomments from the colleague, he confronted her about her recording their conversation\n(Tr. 79-80).  At this point, the interview ceased.  \nAfter interviewing both Applicant and her colleague, the investigating detective\nconcluded that Applicant and the colleague had been involved in a romantic affair that\nbegan in June 2005.  During this time, Applicant and her colleague traveled together to\nother cities, enjoyed concerts, and shopped and hiked together on numerous occasions\n(ex. 2). According to the detective\u2019s police report, all of Applicant\u2019s encounters with her\ncolleague occurred without her husband\u2019s knowledge.  A produced an audio tape that\nhe recorded during a subsequent conversation between himself and Applicant after the\nreported December 2005 incident. The tape supported A\u2019s earlier statements to the\ninvestigating detective that Applicant and A had engaged in consensual sexual\nintercourse on the date of Applicant\u2019s reported incident (see ex. 2).  \nBased on his evaluation of the statements contained in A\u2019s produced audio tape\nand his interviews of A and Applicant, D concluded that Applicant broke off her\nrelationship with A shortly after her sexual encounter with him (see ex. 2).  According to\nthe detective\u2019s account of the exchange between Applicant and A on this audio tape,\nApplicant suggested nothing that would indicate she had been raped by A on the date\nshe reported (ex. 2).  \nAfter affording Applicant several opportunities to admit to him that she was not\nsexually assaulted by A, D ceased trying to elicit a recant of her rape charges.\nApplicant never actually recanted her claims that A forcibly subjected her to sexual\nintercourse (see ex. 2; Tr.73-75).  Applicant and A each obtained restraining orders\nagainst each other (ex. 2; Tr. 83).  Both were either dissolved, or expired without\nincident.  \nIn late January 2006, the D served Applicant with a uniform summons and\ncomplaint, charging her with false reporting in violation of the governing state code, a\nClass 3 misdemeanor. At a scheduled hearing on the charge in February 2006,\nApplicant, through her lawyer, pleaded guilty to one count of false reporting (see exs. 2,\n\n \n5\n3, and A; Tr. 73-74, 81-82, 90-92). According to Applicant, the plea papers presented to\nher for signature did not contain any recant language, and Applicant never signed any\nkind of letter recanting what she reported to police in mid-January 2006  (Tr. 91-93). \nThe court accepted Applicant\u2019s guilty plea and issued a 12-month deferred\nsentence with conditions that she complete 48 hours of community service and send\nletters of apology to the accused and D (the investigating police detective). By all\naccounts, Applicant complied with the court\u2019s conditions, and the charge was ultimately\ndismissed (Tr. 89-90). \nIn explaining her reasons for accepting a guilty plea to the false reporting\ncharges, Applicant stressed that the interviews and emotional trauma from the process\nwere too much for her to endure any longer (Tr. 73-75, 88).  With her guilty plea, which\nshe assured she did not fully comprehend, she hoped to forgive, accept the\nconsequences of a misdemeanor plea,  and move on with her life and family (Tr. 74-76,\n82-84). \nBased on the police investigation reports from D, Applicant\u2019s rape charges\nagainst A lack substantive proof.  Considered in their totality, the investigation reports\nlend more evidentiary support to A\u2019s account of a voluntary sexual encounter on the\ndate Applicant claimed that he raped her. Although she has never recanted her rape\ncharge against A, her guilty plea is amply supported by the record evidence.  Except for\nwitness B (who testified on her behalf), she has never told any of her supervisors and\ncoworkers about the her claimed rape incident or how she pleaded to a false reporting\ncharge (Tr. 94-96). Witness B affirmed that he did pass on the information about\nApplicant\u2018s rape charge and subsequent guilty plea to Applicant\u2019s manager (Tr. 134-\n35). However, it is not fully evident what details witness B conveyed or what information\nApplicant shared with her husband about all of the circumstances associated with her\nreported rape charges. Nor is it clear from the produced police investigation report\nwhether A used any forcible seduction upon Applicant to induce her to succumb to his\nadvances. \nBecause Applicant declined to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding her\nreported account of the incident when pressed by the investigating police detective and\nthe investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) who interviewed her\nin January 2008, all of the circumstances surrounding the December 2005 incident may\nnever be fully revealed.  The developed facts contained in the February 2008 police\ninvestigation report are detailed and credible and were not challenged by Applicant in\nher court appearance on the false reporting charges. \nWhile collateral estoppel principles do not preclude Applicant from challenging\nthe accuracy of the underlying charges controlled by her guilty plea under the facts\npresented, she  has not presented any credible evidence to corroborate her renewed\nrape claims against A, or cast doubt upon the detailed taped accounts of A\u2019s post-\nincident conversations with Applicant. Her plea and her assigned reasons for entering a\nguilty plea to false reporting charges are entitled to evidentiary consideration, in addition\n\n \n6\nto the accounts of the incident contained in the investigation reports and Applicant\u2019s\nhearing testimony.\nBased on a thorough review of all of the circumstances associated with\nApplicant\u2019s rape claims and ensuing guilty plea, A\u2019s detailed account reported in the\npolice investigation report (ex. 2) must be accepted as the most accurate account of the\nincident.  Inferences warrant that the rape charges as reported by Applicant to local\npolice in January 2006 did not represent a full and accurate account of what transpired\nbetween herself and A.\nEndorsements and award\nApplicant is highly regarded by her supervisors, co-workers, and mentors.  By all\naccounts, she and her husband have maintained a strong and viable marriage since\nshe disclosed the incident to him. Applicant is respected and admired for her\nengineering skills and mentoring efforts with her employer (see exs. B through H).\nColleagues who are familiar with Applicant\u2019s work ethic and performance attributes\ncredit her with being very conscientious, trustworthy, and dependable (see ex. A; Tr. 64-\n68, 102-04, 116-21, 129-33). Applicant has received awards recognizing her\noutstanding contributions to her employer\u2019s contracts (see ex. A; Tr. 64). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) list guidelines to be used by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These\nguidelines take into account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for\nthe individual applicant, as well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. These guidelines\ninclude \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d\n(disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate\nsecurity concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or\nnot a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not\nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of\nthe guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with\nAG \u00b6 2(c)\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \n\n \n7\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  AG, \u00b6 30.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800 (1988).  As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\n\n \n8\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation of the Government's case. Because Executive Order 10865 requires that\nall security clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a high performing and well regarded meritorious test engineer of a\ndefense contractor who was charged and convicted of filing a false police report in\nJanuary 2006, charging a coworker/family friend with rape.  Claiming she pleaded guilty\nin the belief her plea involved a minor offense and would enable her to avoid the\nemotional trauma of reliving the rape experience, she has never recanted her rape\ncharges and has apparently never advised her husband and colleagues of what was\nactually detailed in the pertinent investigation report. Charging a colleague with\nfelonious rape to cover up an extra-marital affair represents a serious breach of trust\nand candor that could have produced far reaching criminal, employment, and social\nrepercussions for A, if not for some diligent investigation efforts by D (the investigating\ndetective assigned to the case). Considered together, Applicant\u2019s actions create\nsufficient indicia of serious criminal and personal conduct to raise security concerns\nunder both the criminal and personal conduct guidelines.  \nCriminal conduct concerns\nBy itself, Applicant\u2019s 2006 guilty plea and resulting conviction is serious enough\nto be security-significant; even though it is an isolated and somewhat dated incident,\nand only a Class 3 misdemeanor.  When considered in the context of the seriousness\nof the false charges and what implications the charges could have presented to A and\nprosecutors (had they elected to accept Applicant\u2019s story and prosecute A for a rape\noffense), security concerns are clearly presented under Guideline J. \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s guilty plea to false reporting charges is not entitled to\npreclusive effect based on collateral estoppel principles.  First and foremost, Applicant\nwas never convicted of filing a false police report: Upon applicant\u2019s demonstrated\ncompliance with the conditions established by the court, th charge was subsequently\ndismissed. Moreover, preclusive conditions are never automatically imposed on an\napplicant who challenges the findings underlying a misdemeanor guilty plea.  See ISCR\nCase No. 04-05712 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006). In this case, the Board\n\n \n9\ndistinguished its previous applications of collateral estoppel principles to applicants\nseeking to discredit their criminal convictions (see ISCR Case No. 95-0817 at 2-3 (App.\nBd. Feb. 21, 1997), and adopted a three-prong test for determining whether collateral\nestoppel effect should be accorded a misdemeanor conviction. Citing Haring v. Prosise,\n462 U.S. 306, 313 (1983) and Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 155 (1979), the\nBoard imposed requirements of (1) an applicant\u2019s having a full and fair opportunity to\nlitigate the issue, (2) the same issue put in issue as litigated in the criminal proceeding,\nand (3) the absence of any special circumstances (such as the lack of any incentive to\nlitigate in the first proceeding) that could make the imposition of collateral estoppel\nunfair to the party opposing the according of preclusive effect to a misdemeanor\nconviction.  See Otherson v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 711 F.2d 267, 273 (D.C. Cir. 1983)(\ncited by Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 04-05712, supra).\nWhether because of the absence of a conviction or the availability of one of the\nthree-prong exceptions under DOHA\u2019s established jurisprudence governing the\nemployment of collateral estoppel in misdemeanor cases, Applicant may reclaim her\nversion of the underlying facts that directly support her rape claims in the police report\nshe filed in December 2005.  In waging a direct challenge of the underlying facts linked\nto her guilty plea, Applicant provided record evidence that she was advised by counsel\nthat the underlying false reporting charges were not serious.  In turn, she assured that\nshe accepted this advice and entered a guilty plea in the hope she could avoid re-\nlitigation of a very traumatic event and move on with her life.  Based on her evidence,\nshe was permitted to reassert her rape claims.  By her evidence, she satisfied the\nminimal requirements for averting preclusive effect of her misdemeanor guilty plea.\nStill, the accounts contained in the investigation report and Applicant\u2019s ensuing\nguilty plea to the false reporting charges waged against her are sufficiently probative to\nsurmount her renewed rape claims and support the underlying findings covered by her\nplea. Together, her guilty plea and corroborating evidence of the underlying charges\nwarrant initial consideration of two disqualifying conditions of the AG for criminal\nconduct: DC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and DC \u00b6\n31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged.\u201d While the false report charge against Applicant was ultimately\ndismissed after she completed her deferred adjudication conditions, the underlying\nactions she attempted to shield with her rape charges against A reflect serious\nbreaches of fidelity to her husband and the potential for the protracted use of state and\npersonal resources to clear A of Applicant\u2019s rape charges. \nBased on the evidentiary record, Applicant may not rely on any of the potentially\npertinent mitigating conditions of the criminal conduct guideline. Considering Applicant\u2019s\ncontinuing denial of the underlying facts governing the false reporting charges she\npleaded guilty to, and the potentially far-reaching criminal implications of her rape\ncharges had they been prosecuted, her actions continue to cast doubt on her reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Hence, neither MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n\n \n10\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d  MC \u00b6 32(b), \u201cthe person was pressured\nor coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the\nperson\u2019s life,\u201d nor MC \u00b6 32(c), \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense,\u201d\nhave any application to the Applicant\u2019s situation. MC \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d has some\napplication, in recognition of Applicant\u2019s lack of any other confrontations with law\nenforcement authorities, excellent employment record, and still viable marriage.  \nBoth from a consideration of the applicable guidelines and from a whole person\nperspective, Applicant fails to establish sufficient remorse and rehabilitation necessary\nto meet all of the minimum requirements under the criminal conduct guideline for\ncontinued eligibility to hold a security clearance. Taking  into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances developed in the record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nthe allegations covered by subparagraph 1.a of the SOR.\nPersonal conduct concerns\nBecause the Class 3 misdemeanor charges underlying Applicant\u2019s 2006 guilty\nplea involve honesty issues, they pose overlapping personal conduct concerns as well.\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for\nholding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s filing of\nfalse rape charges against her coworker and family friend over three weeks after the\nalleged offense. So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified\ninformation that discounting actions that reflect serious breaches of fidelity and candor\nare gauged very narrowly. \nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, since she failed to promptly correct\nher rape charges when confronted by the investigating officer in 2006 and the ensuing\nOPM investigator who interviewed her in December 2008.  By knowingly and willfully\nfailing to disclose all of the reported facts in A\u2019s account to the investigating detective at\nany time before or after her arranged guilty plea in 2006, Applicant concealed materially\nimportant background information needed for both prosecuting state officials and OPM\ninvestigators to properly process and evaluate the underlying facts associated with her\nguilty plea. Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding her filing of false rape\ncharges against her coworker and friend, and failing to formally recant her charges,\neven after pleading guilty to a Class 3 misdemeanor, Applicant\u2018s actions lack any\nprompt, good-faith corrections of her false charges, which are necessary to successfully\nmitigate security concerns.\nBecause she has been selective in what she has told her husband, supervisors,\nand coworkers about all of the pertinent accounts covered in D\u2019s investigation report\nfollowing her filing of rape charges against A in December 2005, she remains potentially\n\n \n11\nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  As a result, she may not take\nadvantage of any of the mitigating conditions of the personal conduct guideline.  \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of trust\nand candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically\nimposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). \nFrom a whole person standpoint, Applicant documents favorable assessments\nfrom her supervisors and colleagues, and stresses her long history of devotion to her\nassigned responsibilities with her employer.  However, the cumulative effects of her\nbringing false rape charges against a colleague and friend and later pleading guilty to\nfiling a false criminal report with the competent law enforcement authority outweigh the\nmany positive credits she has earned in her professional life.  Considering all of the\nevidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the AGs (inclusive of\nthe 2(a) factors), unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 2.a of\nGuideline E.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Laura J. Anderson, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members are now all in the U.S., but his friends and\nextended family members in Pakistan, together with frequent and extended visits there\nby him and his mother, support foreign influence security concerns that were not\nmitigated. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on June 4, 2008. On\nMarch 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nAugust 27, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 24, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (AR) on March 26, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 6, 2009,\nand the case was assigned to me on May 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non June 1, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 23, 2009. The\nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. The\nGovernment also offered HE I, comprising a request that I take administrative notice of\ncertain facts concerning the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and seven Government\ndocuments supporting the veracity of those facts. Applicant had no objection, and\nadministrative notice was taken of these facts. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and\nsubmitted exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until July 15, 2009, to permit his counsel\u2019s\nsubmission of a written final argument and any possible objection to the administrative\nnotice request. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009. On\nthat same date, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted her final argument, without objection to\nthe administrative notice request, and AE D. These documents were forwarded by\nDepartment Counsel without objection on July 10, 2009. AE D was admitted into\nevidence, and the record closed on July 15, 2009, without further submissions.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the factual allegations and\ndenied others with explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in\nhis response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 2), are incorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant is a 25-year-old computer security intern employed by a defense\ncontractor. He has worked for his present employer for just over a year. He was born\nand raised in Pakistan. When he was two years old, his father immigrated to the United\nStates to attend school. His father eventually obtained permanent resident status, and\nthen became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996. (GE 1 at 6; Tr. at 98, 111. )\nIn early 2000, after becoming a citizen and establishing himself financially,\nApplicant\u2019s father obtained visas for his three children to join him in the U.S. Applicant\nand his younger sister were both under age 18, and were accordingly eligible to apply\nfor citizenship as their father\u2019s children without going through the adult naturalization\nprocess. (Tr. at 51, 59, 113.) Applicant became a U.S. citizen during August 2001, at\nage 17. (GE 1 at 7.) His sister obtained her U.S. citizenship during February 2002. (AE\nB.) His older brother, who was already 18 years old when they arrived, had to qualify for\nnaturalization as an adult. He completed all requirements and became a U.S. citizen in\n2005. (Tr. at 84.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s visa took longer to be approved. Since she was ill, Applicant\nreturned to Pakistan for three or four weeks in 2001 to assist her and try to expedite the\nvisa process. She finally obtained her visa and came to the U.S. later in 2001. (Tr. at 50,\n59.) His mother became a U.S. citizen in January 2007. (AE C.) Applicant traveled to\nPakistan again in February 2003, to visit family and friends. During all his trips to\n\n3\nPakistan, he stayed with his mother\u2019s relatives, and did not work. Although Applicant\ntestified that he could not recall the details of this trip, the entry and exit stamps in\nApplicant\u2019s passport suggest this was a six-month trip that lasted until September 2003.\n(GE 2 at I11, I20, Tr. at 50-51, 76.) Applicant also returned to Pakistan in December\n2003 to visit his ill grandfather, with whom he was very close. He initially planned to go\nfor a few weeks, but his grandfather\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate so he remained\nto assist his elderly grandmother with his grandfather\u2019s care. Finally, his grandfather\npassed away and he remained for the funeral. He returned to the U.S. in June 2004.\n(GE 2 at I20, AR at 4; Tr. at 48-50.) \nApplicant\u2019s passport also indicates a visit to Pakistan of undetermined length\nending in June 2005. He admitted there may have been more trips to Pakistan in\naddition to the 2001 and 2007 trips he disclosed to the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator but said he could not remember the details. (GE 2 at I12, I20.)\nAlthough his visa to visit Pakistan was not due to expire until September 15, 2007,\nApplicant obtained a new visa to conduct multiple visits to Pakistan of up to one year in\nduration on June 6, 2007. The new visa is valid until June 2012, and was issued for the\npurpose of visiting family. (GE 2 at 11, 15.)\nApplicant\u2019s sister married a man from Pakistan during 2007. Applicant went to\nPakistan for the wedding, arriving in July and departing in September. He went early\nbecause he was the only family member available to spend the time to help his sister\nwith wedding arrangements. (Tr. at 47-48.) Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law became a\npermanent resident of the U.S. in September 2008, and resides with Applicant\u2019s sister in\nthe U.S., where they intend to remain. (AR at 10; Tr. at 45.) \nIn 2008, Applicant\u2019s brother married a woman from Pakistan in a U.S. ceremony\nconducted after she entered the U.S. on a fiancee visa during July 2007. She became a\npermanent U.S. resident in January 2009, and intends to remain in the U.S. and\nbecome a citizen when eligible. (AR at 12-14; Tr. at 85-86.)\n Applicant lives with his mother, sister, brother-in-law, brother, and sister-in-law\nin one residence. His father and mother recently divorced, and his father lives with his\nnew wife in a different part of the same city. (Tr. at 87, 117.) Applicant has other, more\ndistant relatives still living in Pakistan, to include his mother\u2019s sister, his father\u2019s mother,\nhis father\u2019s brother and three sisters, and the complete families of his brother-in-law and\nsister-in-law. His mother\u2019s brother, who was the uncle who worked for the Pakistani\npolice as alleged in the SOR, passed away in February 2009. (AR at 3, 7; Tr. at 46, 74-\n75, 109, 114.) Applicant said he has little to no personal contact with any of these\npeople, but his immediate relatives do maintain contact with their respective relatives.\n(Id.) None of those people is connected to the governments of Pakistan, the U.S., or\nany other country. \nApplicant\u2019s mother had two surgeries for heart problems shortly after arriving in\nthe U.S. As noted above, she became a U.S. citizen in January 2007. The following\nmonth, she returned to live in Pakistan so that her sister and brother there could help\n\n4\nher to take care of her ongoing heart condition and keep her company. She lived with\nher sister and her sister\u2019s family there. All three of her children in the U.S. were away at\nwork or school all day, and she was unhappy being left alone. She remained in Pakistan\nafter her daughter\u2019s 2007 wedding there, to help care for her brother who became\nseriously ill shortly thereafter. Her brother passed away in February 2009, and she\nreturned to the U.S. in April 2009. My understanding of Applicant\u2019s testimony is that his\nmother also spent some unspecified amount of time between 2001 and 2007 living with\nher sister in Pakistan due to her heart condition. Applicant and his mother have a close\nrelationship, and he spoke with her by telephone every other day while she was in\nPakistan. (GE 2 at I20-I21; AR at 3; Tr at 70-73.) \nDuring his July 2008 OPM interview, Applicant said that he still had relatives and\nfriends in Pakistan. He said the purposes of his visits from December 2003 to June\n2004, and from January to February 2001, were to visit family and friends. He said that\nhe maintained contact with his \u201cnumerous friends\u201d in Pakistan via online chat on a\nsporadic basis, from once every month to every six months. Other than his uncle who\nworked for the police, all his friends and relatives there work in banking and private\nbusinesses. He said that he does not have a preference for the U.S. over Pakistan nor\nfor Pakistan over the U.S. He further stated that both Pakistan and the United States\nare his countries and he would not choose one country as a preference over the other.\n(GE 2 at I20-I21.) He reviewed, adopted, and attested to the accuracy of these\nstatements, under oath, on October 30, 2008. (GE 2 at I23-I24.)\nWhen asked to explain these remarks, Applicant testified:\nShe asked me to go back, I think, ten years. I told her when I was new\nhere I just chat with them sometimes, like once in a month, some once in\nsix months, just to - - because I was so new here, I didn\u2019t know anybody, I\ndidn\u2019t have any friends. So I just chat with them for a little bit. And then\nafter that I stopped chatting because I don\u2019t know where they are at now\nand what they are doing and they don\u2019t know where I am right now and\nwhat I\u2019m doing. . . . [From last July until now I have lost touch with all\nthese friends.] . . .  And that time [July/October 2008], now - - I was just\ngoing to school here and making friends but now I\u2019m more involved in\nserving into the community. Now I\u2019m having more friends, so now I\u2019m\ngetting used to more in this culture. I\u2019m liking it more. So now my thinking\nare [sic] changing now. Like I want to stay here forever. I don\u2019t want to go\nback now. At the beginning I was just like going to school and work. I\ndidn\u2019t have friends. Actually, I didn\u2019t have time to go out. But now I do\nsocializing, do go out with my friends, watch movies, have fun with them.\nSo now I\u2019m, like, you know, I\u2019m enjoying my life here. I want to stay here\nforever. And at the beginning it was like little different because I was very\nnew here. \n(Tr. at 78-80.) During his hearing testimony, and in his written response to the SOR, he\nreferred to Pakistan as \u201chome\u201d several times. (AR at 4; Tr. at 70, 71.)\n\n5\nI took administrative notice of the facts set forth in HE I concerning the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, which are incorporated herein by reference. Of particular\nsignificance are the active and hostile presence of Al Qaida, Taliban, and other\nextremist groups, and concerns over weapons and nuclear technology transfers and\ncooperation with countries including North Korea, Iran, Libya, and China.   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \n\n6\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established\none of them: \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion.\u201d (Tr. at 121-123.) Although not directly asserted by Department\nCounsel, disqualifying conditions \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\u201d and \u00b6\n7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if\nthat relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure or coercion;\u201d were also raised by substantial evidence.\nPakistan has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats and a history of\nsecurity-related technology proliferation and transfers contrary to U.S. interests.\nAccordingly, connections there have more potential to generate heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a)\nand (d) than would similar connections in many other countries. \nApplicant shares living quarters with his mother, brother, sister, brother-in-law,\nand sister-in-law. He has a close and loving relationship with his mother, and through\nher has an entirely legitimate, serious interest in the welfare of her sister and her sister\u2019s\nfamily who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. He also has a strong and loving\n\n7\nrelationship with his brother and sister, both of whom have spouses who are Pakistani\ncitizens whose entire families are resident citizens there. Although living separately,\nApplicant also shares a close relationship with his father, whose mother, brother, and\nthree sisters are resident citizens of Pakistan. \nApplicant\u2019s numerous and lengthy visits to Pakistan, since coming to the U.S. in\n2000, further demonstrate his ongoing connections and ties there. As recently as\nOctober 30, 2008, he attested that he considered Pakistan as much his country as the\nU.S., and described regular contacts with numerous friends who reside there. \nThese facts meet the Government\u2019s burden of production by raising all three of\nthe aforementioned disqualifying conditions. Applicant\u2019s contacts, relationships, and\nconnections with Pakistan and his numerous friends and relatives from there shift a\nheavy burden to him to prove mitigation under applicable Appeal Board precedent. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those with\npotential application in mitigating AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 (a), (b), and (d) security concerns are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nConsidered in light of the significant anti-western terrorism threat and history of\nsecurity-related technology transfer problems in Pakistan, Applicant did not demonstrate\nthat it is unlikely he could be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual or government and those of the U.S. due to his\nfriendships and family ties there. Even if his claims to have recently lost all personal\ncontact with, and interest in, friends and relatives residing in Pakistan are true, he has\nclose relationships with his parents and siblings, all of whom have ongoing relationships\nwith close relatives who are resident citizens there. His communication and contact with\nPakistani friends and family members during at least five lengthy visits there since he\ncame to the U.S. in 2000 were neither casual nor infrequent. Accordingly, he failed to\nestablish the mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8 (a) and (c).\n\n8\nThe evidence also fails to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). Applicant\nasserted that his recent progress in making and socializing with new friends in the U.S.\nhas caused him to change his thinking, to get used to and like this culture more, and to\ndecide he wants to stay here rather than return to Pakistan. Having been offered a good\njob that requires a security clearance cannot be discounted as a significant factor in this\nnewfound appreciation for the U.S. As recently as last October, Applicant expressed\nequal loyalty toward Pakistan and the U.S., before becoming aware of the security\nclearance implications of those sentiments. Furthermore, he made lengthy visits back to\nPakistan at least every other year since coming here at age 16, most recently less than\ntwo years ago. He came to the U.S. at his parent\u2019s direction after his father obtained\ncitizenship and could sponsor him, and it was his father who applied for and obtained\nU.S. citizenship for him while he was a minor. He has no record of service or sacrifice\nfor the U.S. that would demonstrate any deep or longstanding relationships or loyalties\nunder Appeal Board precedent.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Security concerns do not\ninvolve any personal misconduct, dishonesty, irresponsibility, or disloyal activity. The\nprimary whole-person issues of concern under these circumstances are his direct and\nindirect relationships with Pakistani friends and relatives, and his personal connection to\nPakistan where he was born and lived for almost two-thirds of his life. These\nconsiderations raise, \u201c(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\u201d\nand \u201c(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s extended family members and friends, who reside in and are citizens\nof Pakistan, create an ongoing potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.\nHis close relationships with his parents naturally make the welfare of their siblings and\nhis grandmother important to him. His close relationships with his siblings similarly give\nhim good reason to be concerned for the families of their Pakistani spouses. The\nfrequent and extended visits to Pakistan by both Applicant and his mother since 2000\nexpose them personally to potential exploitation, duress, and terrorist activity as U.S.\ncitizens. Recurrent visits to Pakistan by one or both of them in the future are likely.\nApplicant renewed his visa to permit multiple visits there for up to a year until 2012, and\nthe health reasons for which his mother went to live with her sister remain unchanged.\nApplicant states that he and his mother now intend to remain in the U.S. permanently,\nbut their established pattern to the contrary since 2001 makes it premature to base\nsubstantial mitigation on those assertions.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from foreign influence considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant*\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant**\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n* Excepting the words, \u201cand resident.\u201d Of the excepted words, For Applicant.\n** Substituting the word \u201cwife\u201d for the word \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d [sic]; and excepting the words \u201cand\nresident.\u201d Of the excepted words, For Applicant.\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 8, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On August 30, 2010,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\n\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the Guideline J mitigating conditions; whether the Judge erred in concluding that the\nGovernment failed to establish security concerns under Guideline E; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-\nperson analysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following\ndiscussion, we reverse the decision of the Judge.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a technical coordinator\nemployed by a Defense contractor.  He is married, with two children and two stepchildren.  \nIn June 1993Applicant was arrested for malicious mischief and reckless endangerment.  He\npaid a fine without appearing before a Judge.  In February 1994, Applicant and two friends broke\ninto an office building in order to commit theft.  Applicant was caught, though his friends got away.\nHe was tried in Juvenile court, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 24 months community supervision,\n50 days detention, and a fine.  \nIn February 1996, a warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest on charges that he stole tools\nfrom a hardware store.  The probable cause affidavit (Item 8) was not accompanied by the police\nreport to which it refers.  Applicant contends that he was never served with this warrant.  In\nSeptember 1996 a bench warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest for failure to appear in court on\na forgery charge.  There is no evidence that Applicant was served with this warrant.  Applicant\nbecame aware of these warrants in July 2008.  He contacted several lawyers in his hometown and\nreceived minimum quotes of $15,000 for representing him.  He began saving money but had an\nunexpected medical emergency, which consumed his funds.  \u201cHe understands that he must\neventually resolve the warrants.\u201d  Decision at 3.\nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, the Board will review\nthe Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to\narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nGuideline J\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged the criminal conduct occurring in 1993 and 1994.  It also\nincluded the following: \n1(d):  \u201cA warrant was issued on February 5, 1996, for your failure to appear on charges of\nTheft 2, felony, which occurred in approximately June 1995.  As of the date of this [SOR], you have\nnot resolved this warrant.\u201d  \n1(e): \u201cA warrant was issued on September 4, 1996, for your failure to appear on a charge of\nforgery.  As of the date of this [SOR], you have not resolved this warrant.\u201d  \nThe Judge concluded that the evidence established security concerns under Guideline J.  He\nalso concluded that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  He stated that the\ncriminal conduct, including that alleged in the 2 paragraphs quoted above, was old, that Applicant\nhad been a teenager when he committed them, and that he had demonstrated rehabilitation in the\nintervening years by his employment record, his educational attainments, and his family life.  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusions about mitigation are erroneous.  This\nargument has merit.  While the underlying offenses may have occurred in the early to mid-1990s,\nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve the outstanding warrants is ongoing.  Even if one accepts as true\nApplicant\u2019s statements in his replies to the SOR and to the file of relevant material (FORM) that he\nhad no knowledge of these warrants until his July 2008 security clearance interview, he has had two\nyears from that date until the close of the record to resolve them, and he has failed to do so.  The\nJudge found credible Applicant\u2019s explanation that legal representation was too costly, due to his\nhaving experienced unexpected medical problems.  Applicant\u2019s explanation is not corroborated, nor\nare his financial condition or the nature and extent of his medical problems explained in detail.\nNeither is there any record evidence of Applicant\u2019s having explored other possibilities for obtaining\nrepresentation, such as the services of a public defender, etc. or otherwise to develop a meaningful\nstrategy for addressing the warrants.  As it is, even accepting as true Applicant\u2019s statement that he\nhad made some contact with lawyers, the decision does not reasonably explain why Applicant\u2019s\nacknowledgment that \u201che must eventually resolve the warrants\u201d (Decision at 3) is sufficient to\ndemonstrate mitigation under the Egan standard.\nMoreover, the record contains significant contrary evidence that is not consistent with the\nJudge\u2019s favorable credibility determination regarding Applicant.  We note that Applicant chose to\n\nhave his case decided on the written record.  As a result, the Judge did not have an opportunity to\nquestion Applicant and observe his demeanor.  In such circumstances, the Judge\u2019s favorable\ncredibility determination is not entitled to the same deference on appeal that it would receive had it\nbeen made in the context of a hearing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 30,\n2005). \nConcerning the two warrants, Applicant stated in his reply to the SOR that he was not aware\nof the charges reflected in these warrants until they were pointed out to him during his interview.\nApplicant\u2019s reply to the FORM included a computer-generated printout summarizing his court cases.\nIt is not stated who prepared this document or on what sources the author relied.  However,\nconcerning the case that resulted in a bench warrant, this document can reasonably be interpreted to\nmean that, on August 9, 1996, officials of the county Superior Court prepared (1) a probable cause\naffidavit, (2) an order by a named county commissioner that probable cause existed as to the offense\nin question, and (3) a summons to the defendant to appear.  The document also states that on August\n30, 1996, a motion hearing was scheduled to be conducted before another named county\ncommissioner.   Item 9, the Bench Warrant and supporting documentation, states that Applicant failed\nto appear in court on that date.  In particular, the Order for Bench Warrant states in pertinent part:\n\u201cThis matter coming on regularly before the Court, this 30th day of August, 1996, the [State] being\nrepresented by [named attorney], Deputy Prosecuting Attorney in and for [County, State], and the\ndefendant not appearing,\u201d the Clerk of Court is ordered to issue a bench warrant for the apprehension\nof Applicant.  This document is signed by a county commissioner.  There is nothing in the record to\nsuggest any irregularity in the processing of the case in question.  See, e.g., U.S. v. Wilson, 169 F.3d\n481, 425 (7th Cir. 1999); Honeycutt v. Ward, 612 F.2d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 1979) (There is a strong\npresumption of regularity in state judicial proceedings).  Neither is there anything in the record or in\nthe Judge\u2019s decision to explain why it is reasonable to believe that this case proceeded to a motion\nhearing without Applicant being aware of it.  The Judge\u2019s failure adequately to discuss this matter\nundermines his favorable decision.   \nConcerning the February 1996 arrest warrant, in addition to his claim of ignorance in his reply\nto the FORM, Applicant stated in his July 2008 interview that he \u201chas no knowledge of this charge.\u201d\nItem 5, Interrogatories, at 3.  However, Item 8, Arrest Warrant, includes the probable cause affidavit\nupon which the warrant was based.  This document contains a detailed description of the offense for\nwhich Applicant was charged.  It states that on June 21, 1995, Applicant purchased tools from a\nhardware company on the account of a former employer.  The employer had terminated Applicant\u2019s\nemployment on June 10, 1995.  This affidavit states that Applicant obtained a tool chest valued at\n$250 and welding supplies valued at $850.  It states that the information concerning the theft came\nfrom a manager of Applicant\u2019s former employer.  The manager\u2019s name is given in the affidavit.  In\naddition, another named individual, an employee of the hardware store, identified Applicant as the\nperson who purchased the items in question on employer\u2019s account.  Specific as to names and dates,\nthis document states that its contents were provided by the local sheriff\u2019s office.  It constitutes\nsubstantial evidence that Applicant committed the offense of theft, which was the basis for the\nwarrant.  It is significantly contrary to Applicant\u2019s claims not to know anything about the underlying\noffense.  Indeed, for Applicant\u2019s claim of ignorance to be credible, one would have to conclude that\nthe affidavit is totally false.  There is nothing in the record to address or even to broach the possibility\nthat the local district attorney fabricated a case against Applicant.  As it stands, the evidence\nunderlying the two warrants alleged in the SOR is not consistent with a favorable credibility\n\ndetermination concerning Applicant and undermines the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.\nTo sum up, the record demonstrates that Applicant committed a series of criminal offenses\nin the 1990s.  It demonstrates that Applicant has two outstanding warrants dating from that time, one\nfor theft of over $1,000 of tools and equipment and one for failure to appear in court.  Although\nApplicant has known about these warrants for at least two years, he has taken no affirmative steps\nto resolve the underlying charges.  Furthermore, the record contains evidence that is inconsistent with\nApplicant\u2019s credibility.  Viewed as a whole, the record does not support the Judge\u2019s favorable\nconclusion under Guideline J, either under the mitigating conditions or the whole-person factors. \nGuideline E  \nThe Judge concluded that the Government\u2019s evidence did not establish Guideline E security\nconcerns.  The SOR incorporated under Guideline E the criminal concerns alleged under Guideline\nJ.  It also alleged that Applicant had made a false statement during his security clearance interview\nby denying any criminal conduct after 1994.  The Judge stated that the criminal conduct allegations\ndid not raise a security concern not contained under Guideline J.  He also stated that the language of\nthe Guideline E disqualifying conditions does not extend to the criminal conduct alleged against\nApplicant.  Furthermore, the Judge found that, insofar as Applicant did not know about his\noutstanding warrants at the time of the interview, he did not make a knowingly false statement.  \nThe security concern under Guideline E is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d   Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 15.   The disqualifying conditions listed under Guideline E,\nas with the other guidelines, are illustrative only, not exhaustive and exclusive.  In analyzing cases\nbefore them, Judges must be guided by common sense and with a view toward making a reasoned\ndetermination consistent with the interests of national security.  See  ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 4\n(App. Bd. May 27, 2008); see also ISCR Case No. 06-20964 at 4-6 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008) (an\napplicant\u2019s failure to file income tax returns properly alleged both under Guideline F and Guideline\nE).    \nRegarding the alleged criminal acts, Applicant\u2019s having failed to resolve his outstanding\nwarrants is an ongoing course of conduct that evidences \u201cquestionable judgment\u201d of a nature to\nundermine his reliability and trustworthiness.  Furthermore, for reasons stated in the discussion of\nGuideline J above, a reasonable person could conclude that Applicant\u2019s denial of criminal conduct\nafter 1994 was not credible.  The warrants arising from 1996 provide substantial evidence both that\nApplicant engaged in criminal conduct after 1994 and that he made a deliberately false statement to\nthe interviewer.  Merely to conclude, as the Judge did, that Applicant was unaware of the warrants\ndoes not provide a reason to believe that he had not committed the criminal conduct to which they\nrefer.

Applicant timely answered and\n1\nrequested a decision without hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 28 April 2010.\nThe case record closed 22 April 2010, when Department Counsel gave no objection to\nApplicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, Items 1-9).\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted a June 1993 arrest for malicious mischief and reckless\nendangerment (SOR 1.c) and a February 1994 arrest for theft and burglary (SOR 1.a\nAugust 30, 2010\n\nAlthough the Government alleged the theft and burglary as separate charges (SOR 1.a and 1.b), the two\n2\nallegations arose out of the same incident and were tried together.

He denied the remainder of the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate his\nadmissions as findings of fact. He is a 32-year-old technical coordinator employed by a\ndefense contractor since September 2007. He has not previously held a security\nclearance.\nApplicant grew up on the west coast, but has lived on the east coast since at\nleast September 1999. He has been married for 10 years. He and his wife have two\nchildren together, and she has two teenagers from an earlier relationship. Applicant got\nhis college degree in February 2008.\nAs a teenager, Applicant hung out with the wrong crowd. In June 1993, he was\narrested (along with two other friends and several combatants) for malicious mischief\nand reckless endangerment for violating the city curfew for minors and getting into a\nfight. He went to court and paid a fine without appearing before a judge.\nIn February 1994, Applicant and two friends got the admittedly-ludicrous idea to\nbreak into an office building and steal something. The owner of the building was still\nthere, and he caught Applicant; the two friends got away. Applicant was charged with\nburglary and theft.   He was tried in juvenile court, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 24\n2\nmonths community supervision, 50 days detention, and fined. Applicant completed his\nsentence without incident, and the case files were closed in May 1998.\nAfter his February 1994 arrest, Applicant started taking additional classes at an\non-line high school, while still attending his regular school, so he could accelerate his\ngraduation date to graduate before he had to serve his detention. He graduated from\nhigh school in June 1994, and served his detention the remainder of that summer.\nIn February 1996, a warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest on charges that he\nstole tools from a hardware store by trick in June 1995 (Item 8). The probable cause\naffidavit was signed by the county prosecutor based on a 1995 police report that is not\nin evidence.  Applicant contends, and the Government\u2019s documents tend to confirm, the\n3\nwarrant was never served on him, despite the fact that he lived in the same town for at\nleast a year after the alleged theft and his mother was a deputy sheriff in the county\nwhere he lived.\nIn September 1996, a warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest for failure to\nappear (Item 9) on charges alleged to be forgery. However, the only evidence that the\ncharge was forgery is a hand-written notation on the face of the warrant. There is no\n\n3\ndocumentation that Applicant was ever served a notice to appear on the underlying\ncharge. The warrant itself was not served on Applicant, and Applicant further denies\nhaving been served the underlying notice to appear and warrant. \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM documents that he paid the fees associated\nwith the February 1994 arrest, and received several certificates recognizing his\ncommunity service and volunteer work\u2014including certificates issued by the county\nsheriff in the county where the warrants were issued commending him for his work in\nthe department\u2019s emergency management division. He also provided two work\nreferences praising the quality of his work and his trustworthiness.\nApplicant began researching the outstanding warrants when he became aware of\nthem in July 2008. He contacted several lawyers in his hometown, and received\nminimum quotes of $15,000 to retain counsel on the charges because of their age.\nApplicant began saving money to pay the lawyer\u2019s fees, but had unexpected surgery\nthat consumed the money he had saved. He understands that he must eventually\nresolve the warrants.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommon sense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against\napplicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant\nor denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the\nevidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, it\nestablishes a valid case against access to classified information. Applicant must then\nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a\nsecurity clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n5\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n\u00b632.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n6\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor judgment; (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, . . . higher education, good employment record,\nor constructive community involvement.\n4\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J, by\nshowing Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct in 1993 and 1994, and two arrest warrants in\n1996.  However, Applicant mitigated the criminal conduct security concerns. When\n5\nApplicant moved to the east coast by September 1999, he left behind the environment\nand the people surrounding his criminal conduct. The most recent criminal conduct\u2014the\nalleged-but-not-proven crimes underlying his two warrants\u2014occurred over 13 years\nago. The most recent of the proven criminal conduct occurred over 14 years ago. All the\ncrimes occurred when Applicant was 16-18 years old. There has been no further\ncriminal conduct, not even a traffic stop that could reveal the outstanding warrants, even\nthough Applicant was unaware of the warrants from 1996 to July 2008. He has been\nsteadily employed since April 2000, and currently has a good employment record. He\nmarried (March 2000), started a family (November 2000 and 2004), and obtained his\ncollege degree (February 2008). He paid the fees associated with his 1990s crimes, and\nhas been constructively involved in his community.  Thus, the evidence of successful\n6\nrehabilitation is very strong. I resolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nThe Government did not establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nThe criminal conduct allegations cross-referenced in SOR 2.a raise no security\nconcerns not fully addressed by Guideline J. The allegations of SOR 1.a-e do not\nconstitute deliberate falsification of a clearance application [16. (a)], deliberately false\ninformation to an investigator [16 (b)], adverse information in several adjudicative areas\n[16 (c)] adverse information not explicitly covered elsewhere [16 (d)], personal conduct\ncreating vulnerability to exploitation [16 (e)], a violation of an acknowledged condition of\nemployment [16 (f)], or association with criminals [16 (g)]. SOR 2.b alleges giving false\ninformation to a government investigator by failing to disclose the arrest warrants of\nSOR 1.d and 1.e, but record evidence establishes that Applicant was unaware of the\nwarrants when he was first interviewed. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nThe most important consideration under the whole person factors of AG \u00b6 2(a) is\nthe fact that Applicant still has two outstanding arrest warrants in his home state.\nHowever, he understands that he has to resolve the warrants, and was taking steps to\n\n5\ndo so when unexpected surgery dealt him a financial setback. He has contacted several\nlawyers about representing him in these two matters. Although Applicant has known\nabout the warrants for two years, his decision to postpone surrendering on the warrants\nuntil he has counsel and is able to coordinate his surrender with state law enforcement\nofficials is reasonable and demonstrates good judgment. In the meantime, I consider\nthe risk that he can be pressured because of the warrants is low.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Co-workers who \nknow him state Applicant is kind hearted, trustworthy, diligent, loyal to his family and \nfriends, has a strong work ethic, and is a team leader who displays integrity, \nresponsibility, and ambition in his job. (Ex. A) During the summer, Applicant had a \nsecond job doing landscaping. (Tr. 30)  In 2003, Applicant graduated from high school. \n(Tr. 36) He has taken some college classes. (Tr. 36)  \n \n \nIn November and December 2005, Applicant used marijuana four times. On \nNovember 22, 2005, Applicant, then age 19, sold $20 worth of crack cocaine to an \nundercover police officer. (Ex. 3, page 5 of 27) When arrested, Applicant had in his \npocket the money the undercover officer had paid him and less than one gram of \ncocaine. Applicant was with another individual who Applicant stated he did not know \nuntil Applicant \u201cstarted dealing.\u201d (Tr. 54) Applicant was arrested and charged with drug-\nmanufacture/deliver controlled substance. In January 2006, he received deferred \nadjudication, was fined $200, and was placed on two years probation. Applicant had to \nattend a six-week drug abuse class. He also had to wear an ankle bracelet. In \nNovember 2005, Applicant tested positive in a drug test. (Ex. 2) In March 2006, his \ndeferred adjudication was revoked and he was sentenced to six months in jail.  \n \n \nIn March 2006, the police arranged to buy two pounds of marijuana from \nApplicant for $650. (Ex. 3, page 14 of 27) On March 7, 2006, Applicant sold the \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). \n \n2 \n\nmarijuana to an undercover police officer. Following a vehicle chase, Applicant was \narrested. In the car was 17 grams of crack cocaine, 229 grams of marijuana, and 38 \necstasy tablets. (Ex. 3, page 15 of 27) At Applicant\u2019s residence, the police found, 55 \ngrams of marijuana in the refrigerator, 4 grams in the sofa, and 7 grams in a basket. \nAlso discovered were $1,000 in cash in a shoe box, $500 in a liquor box, and $800 in \nother locations in Applicant\u2019s apartment. (Ex. 3, page 16 of 27) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with the sale and delivery of marijuana. He \nwas also charge with intent to deliver a controlled substance. He was convicted of both \nfelonies after pleading guilty and was sentenced to five years confinement. In July 2007, \nApplicant left prison having served 16 months. (Ex. 4, Tr. 42) While incarcerated, he \nattended 18 drug-treatment counselings. (Ex. 2) He was placed on parole until 2011.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of the March 2006 arrest follows. An individual unknown \nto him asked him if he knew anyone who sold marijuana. The individual, an undercover \npolice officer, stated he was looking to buy three pounds of marijuana. Applicant needed \nmoney for his upcoming trial expenses related to his November 2005 arrest. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant exchanged telephone numbers with the individual and went to an \nacquaintance Applicant knew sold marijuana. The acquaintance put marijuana in a \nbackpack and both drove to meet the individual wanting to buy the marijuana. Applicant \nstates he was unaware the backpack contained anything but marijuana. The bag also \nhad cocaine in it.  \n \n \nOn April 17, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In section 23, he was asked about his police record. \nHe was specifically asked if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense \nrelated to alcohol or drugs. He answered \u201cyes,\u201d and listed his March 2006 arrest, \nconviction, and incarceration, but failed to list his November 2005 arrest. (Ex. 1) He had \nbeen told his sentences would run concurrently and the two actions were being treated \nas one case so he simply listed the most recent conviction. (Tr. 47)  \n \n \nIn section 24, he was asked about his illegal drug use and activity. He was \nspecifically asked if, during the previous seven years, he had ever been involved in the \nillegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, or \nsale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis for his own \nintended profit or that of another. Applicant asserts he misunderstood the question. (Tr. \n48) He answered \u201cno\u201d to the question, but indicated he had used marijuana four times in \n2005. (Ex. 1)  \n \n \nIn November 2009, Applicant again used marijuana. (Tr. 46, 68) As a condition of \nparole, Applicant is subject to periodic drug tests. In December 2009, about a month \nbefore the hearing, Applicant tested positive for illegal drugs. He used marijuana to see \nif he wanted to continue using drugs. He has decided not to continue using illegal drugs. \nApplicant asserts he made mistakes because he was young and has changed his \nlifestyle. He also asserts the criminal conduct occurred during a six to eight-month \nperiod in his life, which has not recurred. (Ex. 27) Applicant no longer associates with \n \n3 \n\nthose individual he saw before his incarceration. He now stays with a friend in a quiet \narea of town. (Tr. 35) He is currently attending church. (Tr. 52) He plans to attend \ncollege classes in the fall of 2010. (Tr. 43) He hopes to open his own business. (Tr. 44)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n \n4 \n\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nRevised adjudicative guideline (AG) \u00b6 24 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable are: \n(a) any drug abuse; \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \nIn 2005, Applicant used marijuana and started dealing in illegal drugs. In \nNovember 2005, he was arrested for selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. In \nMarch 2006, he was arrested for selling two pounds of marijuana to a police officer. At \nthe time of the arrest, the police discovered 17 grams of crack cocaine, 229 grams of \nmarijuana, and 38 ecstasy tablets. At Applicant\u2019s residence, the police found, additional \nmarijuana located in the refrigerator, the sofa, and various other places in Applicant\u2019s \napartment plus $2,300 in cash. Applicant was sentenced to five years imprisonment, \nserved 16 months, and left prison in July 2007. In December 2009, in a periodic drug \ntest required as a condition of his parole, Applicant tested positive for marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25 (a), 25(b), and 25 (c) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n5 \n\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. AG \u00b6 26(a) Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was \nrecent, having occurred one month before the hearing. His marijuana use did not occur \nunder unusual circumstances and his use casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Applicant no longer sees the individuals with whom he was \narrested and now lives in a different area. However, in viewing these factors the period \nof abstinence can not be ignored.  \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was one month before his hearing. There are no \n\u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be \nbased \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by \nthe directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the \nAppeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an \napplicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing \nwas not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without \nany evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d2 One month is not a significant period of abstinence.  \nAG \u00b6 26(c) does not apply because prescription drugs were not abused. Even \nthough Applicant has received counseling related to drug usage, AG \u00b6 26(d) does not \napply because he has used marijuana since his treatment. Finally, there is no favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nRevised adjudicative guideline (AG) \u00b6 15 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to personal conduct: \n \n                                                          \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n6 \n\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant completed his e-QIP. He did not list his November 2005-\ndrug arrest because it and his March 2006 drug arrest were handled as a single matter. \nHe listed the more recent of the arrests. I find for him as to SOR \u00b6 2.a. However, this \nonly explanation for failing to lists his arrest in response to section 24 of the e-QIP was \nhe misunderstood the question. I find against Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 2.b. None of the \nfollowing mitigating factors apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n7 \n\n \nApplicant did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission (AG \u00b6 \n17(a)) nor did he receive bad advice from a reliable source (AG \u00b6 17(b)). AG \u00b6 17(c) \u2013\n17 (g) do not apply on their face.  \nCriminal Conduct \nUnder the Criminal Conduct Guideline, the security eligibility of an applicant is \nplaced into question when an applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal \nactivity which creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those conditions that are potentially applicable are: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year. Unless \nthe person receives a waiver, a person who has been convicted in a \nFederal or State court, including courts martial, sentenced to \nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated for not less \nthan one year, may not be granted or have renewed access to classified \ninformation. \nApplicant was convicted of felony drug offenses and sentenced to five years \nincarcerations. He served 16 months. He is on probation until 2011. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31 (a), 31(c), \n31(d) and 31(f) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; \n \n8 \n\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement; and, \n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be \nmitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries \nof the Military Departments or designee; or the Directors of Washington \nHeadquarters Services (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), \nNational Security Agency (NSA), Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) or designee, has granted a waiver. \n \nApplicant most recent arrest was approximately three years ago. He left prison in \nJuly 2007. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply because the conduct did not occur under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Insufficient time has passed since his \nlast use of marijuana.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(b) does not apply because Applicant was not pressured or coerced into \ncommitting the act. Applicant was out of work and turned to drug dealing to make \nmoney. Many unemployed people do not become drug dealers. AG \u00b6 32(b) does not \napply because Applicant committed the offenses.  \n \nThere is some evidence of rehabilitation. He no longer associates with those with \nwhom he was arrested. He has a steady, full-time job and works a second, part-time \njob. His work performance appears to be outstanding. He is attending church. All these \nfactors are evidence of rehabilitation. But AG \u00b6 32(d) also considers the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity. However, Applicant\u2019s most recent illegal use of \nmarijuana was one month prior to his hearing. \n \nFurther, Applicant was sentenced to five years imprisonment and served 16 \nmonths. When an applicant has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a \nterm exceeding one year and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than \na year the disqualifying condition can not be mitigated unless Applicant is granted a \nwaiver. The evidence is insufficient to warrant a waiver. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \n9 \n\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. During a six to eight month period in \n2005 and 2006, Applicant was a drug dealer. In November 2005, Applicant sold illegal \ndrugs and four months later sold two pounds of marijuana. The amount of money seized \nat the time of the March 2006 arrest suggests that the selling of drugs was a lucrative \nactivity for Applicant. In July 2007, he left prison and in October 2007, obtained his \ncurrent job. He is making changes for the better in his life. However, his last use of \nmarijuana was a month before the hearing. It is too soon to say illegal drugs are no \nlonger a part of his life. He remains on probation until 2011. He was not completely \nhonest when the completed his April 2008 e-QIP.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Illegal Drug Usage: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Criminal Conduct: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n\n \n11 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated Drug Involvement, Criminal Conduct, and Personal \nConduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn December 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement; Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; and Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 26, 2009, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on February 27, 2009. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nMay 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on March 19, 2009. As of May 8, 2009, \nhe had not responded. The case was assigned to me on May 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, which was awarded in March 2008. He is married and has a four-year-old \nchild.1  \n \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana in about 1986. He estimated that he \nsmoked marijuana about ten times before he entered high school in 1988. He smoked \nmarijuana on a weekly or monthly basis during the four years he was in high school. \nFrom the time he graduated high school in 1992 through July 2002, he smoked \nmarijuana on a daily or weekly basis depending on its availability. He stopped smoking \nmarijuana in July 2002.2   \n \n \nApplicant applied for a security clearance in March 2003. He was interviewed for \nhis background investigation in April 2003. He started smoking marijuana again in about \nJune 2003. He would smoke marijuana at home with his wife. His security clearance \nwas denied in January 2004 because of his drug use. He smoked marijuana on a \nmonthly and occasionally weekly basis until January 2004, when he and his wife \nstopped smoking marijuana prior to the conception of their child. The child was born in \nDecember 2004.3 \n \n \nApplicant and his wife did not smoke marijuana while their child was nursing. \nThey started smoking marijuana again in about May 2006, after the child was no longer \nnursing. He smoked marijuana again on a monthly and occasionally weekly basis. He \nalso took methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which is known as ecstasy, on \ntwo different occasions in 2007. Applicant and his wife again decided to stop smoking \nmarijuana in about April 2008, when their child was three years old. Their child was \ngetting to the age that the child could understand what they were doing, and they \nwanted to set a good example for the child. They also decided to have another child, \nwhich further reinforced their decision.4  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his drug use cost him a clearance which has \nhindered his options for job advancement. He indicated that he does not intend to use \nillegal drugs in the future no matter the outcome of this process. He still has a few \nfriends that have used drugs in the past. He is uncertain if they still use drugs. His \ncontact with those friends is minimal and he does not frequent places where drugs are \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Items 3, 5. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Id. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nused. He is willing to undergo any form of drug testing to ensure that he remains drug-\nfree.5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), and \ncertified that his answers were true on June 13, 2008. Section 24b asked: \n \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? \n \nApplicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and stated that between \u201c01/2001 (Estimated)\u201d and \u201c01/2008 \n(Estimated)\u201d he used marijuana 21 times. He added that it was \u201c[o]ccasional usage 3-4 \ntimes a year over the date period indicated. None since that time.\u201d6 He did not list his \necstasy use in 2007. He underreported the frequency of his marijuana use and he \nmisstated the last time he used marijuana. In his response to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted to SOR \u00b6 4.a, which alleged that he intentionally falsified the SF 86 by omitting \nhis ecstasy use.7 He did not respond to the FORM in which Department Counsel \nspecifically commented that Applicant intentionally falsified the SF 86. After considering \nall the evidence, I find that Applicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 by omitting his \necstasy use. \n \n \nApplicant revealed his full drug use when he responded to DOHA interrogatories \non November 12, 2008.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n                                                          \n5 Item 4. \n \n6 Item 5. \n \n7 There is no paragraph 3 in the SOR. The SOR does not allege that Applicant falsified the SOR \nby underreporting his marijuana use. It only alleges that he did not disclose that he used ecstasy. The \nunderreporting of his marijuana use will not be used for disqualification purposes. It is considered as \ncircumstantial evidence on whether he intentionally falsified the SF 86 by omitting his ecstasy use. \n \n8 Item 4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession9 and use are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana at a young age and used it regularly for \nyears. He stopped smoking marijuana in about July 2002, before he applied for a \nsecurity clearance in March 2003. He started smoking marijuana again in about June \n2003, after he was interviewed for his background investigation in April 2003. His \nsecurity clearance was denied in January 2004 because of his drug use. He and his \nwife stopped smoking marijuana again around the same time period, which was prior to \nthe conception of their child. They started smoking marijuana again in about May 2006, \nafter their child was no longer nursing. He regularly smoked marijuana and used \necstasy on two occasions until he stopped using drugs in April 2008. Their child was \ngetting to the age that the child could understand what they were doing and they wanted \nto set a good example. They also decided to have another child, which further \nreinforced their decision. Applicant also realized that his drug use had adversely \n                                                          \n9 Drugs must be possessed in order to be used. \n \n\n \n6 \n \naffected his career. He indicated that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future \nno matter the outcome of this process, and he is willing to undergo any form of drug \ntesting to ensure that he remains drug-free. \n \n \nThere is no bright-line rule as to whether conduct is recent. Applicant has not \nused illegal drugs in about 13 months. However, his drug use was very extensive; \noccurred over a long period of time; and was interrupted by other periods of abstinence \nfollowed by additional drug use. I am unable to make a determination that illegal drug \nuse is completely in his past. His drug use continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not applicable. Applicant has \nindicated a firm intent not to abuse drugs in the future. He does not receive full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b) for the same rationale discussed above. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nIt is a criminal offense to possess and use marijuana and MDMA. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant violated the law every time he used illegal drugs. His last use was \nabout in April 2008. He intentionally provided false information on his SF 86 in June \n2008, which constituted a federal crime. His criminal acts cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. There is insufficient evidence of rehabilitation at \nthis time to find any mitigating condition applicable.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 in June 2008. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable \nas a disqualifying condition.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n8 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant revealed his full drug use when he responded to DOHA interrogatories \non November 12, 2008. While he receives credit for finally being honest, that is \ninsufficient to establish a mitigating condition. I find that no mitigating conditions are \napplicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H, J, and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant used illegal drugs for many years. He underreported his drug use on his SF \n86. While he appears sincere in his statement that he does not intend to use drugs \nagain, he had previous periods of abstinence followed by drug use. It is also difficult to \ngauge true sincerity from the written word. He appears to be on the right track, but at \nthis time, concerns remain about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Drug Involvement, Criminal Conduct, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

He believes he had approximately $110,000 in delinquent debt discharged. The \ndebts discharged related to a foreclosed house, repossessed vehicle, credit card debts, \nand other debts. He was in the Navy at that time and his wife was not working outside \ntheir home.5  \n \nHe was financially secure for about a year and stated his then ex-wife would \nmake charges on their credit cards. He was aware she was making these charges. \nSince then, he consistently has had delinquent debts, but has paid some of his debts. \n \n1 Hearing Exhibit I is Department Counsel\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s additional exhibits. \n \n2 Tr. 20-24, 31, 34. \n \n3 Tr. 25-26, 40-46. \n \n4 Tr. 37-39. \n \n5 Tr. 102-106. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nFrom 2000 to 2009, he occasionally asked some individuals for assistance with his \nfinances, but did not seek any formal financial counseling or assistance.6  \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant contracted with a credit counseling program (CCP). \nThe program researches and disputes those debts Applicant disputes. Applicant and \nthe CCP have been contacting his creditors seeking validation of his debts. He has had \nsome of the alleged debts removed from his credit bureau report (CBR). He is still in the \nprocess of disputing other debts. At the hearing, he anticipated the validation process \nwould be completed sometime in November 2009, and he will begin to make payments \nsometime in December 2009 or January 2010.7  \n \nApplicant denies the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($217) and believes he paid all of his \naccounts with this creditor. He is validating the debt and will pay it if it is determined that \nhe owes the debt. The debt is unresolved.8 \n \nApplicant denies the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($942) because he currently has an \naccount with this creditor and does not believe he would be able to have service with \nthem if he had a delinquent balance. The debt is being verified through the CCP and is \nunresolved.9 \n \nApplicant admitted he had cable service with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($414), \nbut terminated it due to poor service. He admitted he terminated his contract early. The \ndebt is unresolved.10 \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($208), 1.e ($55), 1.f ($207), 1.g ($134), 1.h ($208), 1.v \n($402) and 1.x ($116) are medical debts that Applicant believes should be covered by \nTRICARE, his military medical insurance. He is working with the insurance company to \nresolve them. The debts are pending review by TRICARE. At least one debt is more \nthan three years old. The debts are unresolved.11 \n \nThe judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($9,876) is for legal services. On February 4, 2009, \nApplicant made a payment of $250.12 On February 19, 2009, he made a payment of \n$250.13 Applicant stated he has been making regular payments on the debt since March \n \n6 Tr. 104-108. \n \n7 Tr. 17, 110-114; Answer to SOR. \n \n8 Tr. 117-119; Answer to SOR. \n \n9 Tr. 119-121. \n \n10 Tr. 121-124. \n \n11 Tr. 124-131, 170, 174; Answer to SOR, Exhibit 9. \n \n12 AE C page 7.  \n \n13 AE C page 6. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n73 principal balance.  \n                                                          \n2009. He made three payments that month of $250 each.14 He made one payment in \nApril 2009 of $250.15 He stated he made other payments of $250, until September \n2009. He then reduced the payment amount to $125, in October 2009. He stated he \nhad an agreement with the creditor to reduce his payments to $125 a month, and the \ncreditor agreed to waive the interest charges. The documents Applicant provided show \nthat on October 31, 2009, he owed $12,712.55. Of that amount $4,139 was for \ninterest.16 On May 26, 2009, Applicant made a payment of $500.17 On September 4, \n2009, he made a payment of $125.18 On November 5, 2009, he made a payment of \n$125.19 He provided an email dated July 14, 2009, from the creditor that stated: \u201cUpon \npayment of your full principal due, I\u2019ll write off the interest.\u201d20 There is no mention of an \nacceptable payment amount, and the agreement to write off the interest is contingent \nupon him paying off the $8,5\n21\n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($34) is paid.22 The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($6,388) is for a \nvacation package Applicant purchased in 2005 while he was separated from his first \nwife. He signed the contract, and later when he married his second wife, she was not \nhappy with the plan. The debt has been deleted from his CBR.23 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($897) was a credit card debt from 2004 or 2005.

Applicant was unable to pay the \ndebt due to other debts he incurred from his divorce. He admitted that he is now able to \npay it, but has not.27 \n \nApplicant does not recognize the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.q ($807) and \u00b6 1.r ($636). \nThe debts are being verified by CCP. They are unresolved.28 \n \nThe judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.s ($4,650) is for a debt that was awarded to his ex-wife \nin their divorce. He has satisfied his portion of the debt, and she remains responsible for \nthe remainder.29 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.t ($1,345) is to a phone company. Applicant admitted he \nhad the service in 2000 to 2001, and he is attempting to verify if it is a valid account or \none that his ex-wife was responsible for. He has not resolved the debt.30  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.u ($1,412) is for a health club membership. Applicant \nadmitted he contracted for the services in 2005 to 2006. He stated he canceled the \nmembership. He does not deny the debt, but stated he is negotiating a settlement \nagreement.31  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.w ($472) is for utility services from the city where Applicant \nused to live. He stated he paid the debt, but provided no documentation to prove it.32  \n \n \nApplicant believes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.y ($807) is the same as in \u00b6 1.q. It is for \nthe same amount. The names of the debts are very similar and it is likely a duplicate \ndebt.33 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.z ($866) is for utility services. Applicant denies this debt and \nsays he paid it.

Applicant provided \na document showing a zero balance on the account.35 \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his custody battle and divorce. He \nhas paid four lawyers in different states. He estimated he spent about $25,000 in legal \nfees. He has about $26,000 in delinquent debts. He does not have a budget. He \nadmitted he does not know where all of his money goes. He has not made payments on \nmany of his debts because they are being researched and verified through CCP.36  \n \n \nApplicant owes $1,400 for his 2008 state income taxes. He stated he did not \nhave the money to pay his taxes on time. He explained he was unable to pay his taxes \nbecause his wages were garnished beginning in May 2009 until September 2009, in the \namount of $1,600 a month, for a debt due to a car repossession. The car was \nrepossessed in June 2007. This was a car that was jointly owned by Applicant and his \nex-wife. Through their divorce settlement, he was allocated to pay $12,000 on the debt. \nThe balance on his share of the debt is about $4,000. Applicant stated he has a new \nagreement with the creditor to pay $143 a month on the debt. He did not provide proof \nof the agreement. He intends to begin making the new payment in November 2009.37  \n \n \nApplicant presently earns about $7,712 monthly net salary,38 including his \nmilitary pension. Prior to his current job he was earning $6,774 monthly net salary.39 His \nwife earns about $600 a month. He paid child support until the final custody issue was \nresolved. No child support is authorized in the current order. He sends his younger son \na modest allowance and pays for the son\u2019s cell phone. He was paying his older son\u2019s \ncar insurance ($135 a month) until last month. He provides no other support to him. He \noften pays for his grandchildren\u2019s medical care and other incidentals. He contributes two \npercent of his income to a retirement plan. He does not have any money in a savings \naccount and has enough money in his checking account to cover his monthly expenses. \nApplicant acknowledges he should have money remaining from his monthly salary after \npaying his expenses, but does not know where the remainder is spent.

This equates to $92,544 annually. \n \n39 This equates to $81,288 annually. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nin a written statement that he attended a debt consolidation and reduction seminar in \nMarch 2009.40  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n40 Tr. 45-82, 94-101. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant has a significant history of not meeting his financial obligations. He filed \nfor bankruptcy in 1999 and had approximately $110,000 in delinquent debts discharged. \nApproximately one year later, he was again experiencing financial problems. He has \nmany debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid. Based on Applicant\u2019s long history of financial problems, I cannot find that the \ncircumstances are unlikely to recur. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant had approximately $110,000 discharged in bankruptcy in 1999. This \noccurred prior to the child custody issues that he stated adversely impacted his \nfinances. His delinquent debts at that time were for credit cards, a repossessed car, and \na foreclosed house. A year later, Applicant was again having financial problems. These \nproblems were later exacerbated by a child custody dispute and the legal fees \nassociated with it. For mitigating condition (b) to apply, Applicant must show that the \nconditions that caused his financial problems were beyond his control and he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Although the legal fees associated with the child \ncustody dispute were beyond his control, there is not enough evidence to conclude he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant continued to accumulate a \nsignificant number of delinquent debts, including judgments. He does not have a clear \nunderstanding of where he spends his money each month. He stated he is verifying the \ndebts, but has not yet resolved them. He has paid a few of the debts alleged. However, \nregarding the remaining delinquent debts, he did not provide an explanation or \nsubstantiate the basis of the disputes, other than to repeatedly state he was verifying \nthem. He attended financial counseling in March 2009, but does not have a budget or a \ncredible plan for how he will repay the debts if they are verified. He has not received \nfinancial counseling. Applicant has been aware of his financial problems for some time \nand has only recently made an effort to address them. Applicant has not made a good-\nfaith effort to pay his creditors. He is working with CCP, but at this juncture, it is too \nearly to conclude that Applicant will develop a viable repayment plan and show that he \nis making consistent payments towards resolving all of his delinquent debts. Therefore, I \ncannot find there are clear indications the problem is being resolved. I find mitigating \nconditions (c), (d), and (e) do not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country in the \nNavy for twenty years. He experienced a child custody dispute and incurred significant \nlegal fees related to it. Applicant has a long history of not paying his debts. He had \napproximately $110,000 discharged in bankruptcy in 1999. A year later, he was again \nexperiencing financial problems. His wages are being garnished for a repossessed car. \nHe still owes his state taxes for 2008. He does not have a budget and has not received \nfinancial counseling. He stated he is verifying delinquent debts, but he does not appear \nto have a clear understanding of his finances. He does not know which creditors he \nowes and he has not formulated a plan for repaying them. Applicant earns a reasonable \nsalary, yet he does not know where he spends his money. At this juncture, I find that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns related to his finances. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.m \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.r: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.s:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.t-1.x: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.y-1.aa:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted the factual allegations under Guideline F. Applicant is 30 years old and has been a lead technician with a defense contractor for over two years. Applicant served seven years on active duty in the Army and three years in the Army Reserve. He started working for the defense contractor immediately after leaving active duty. He is divorced, but has remarried, and has custody of the two children from his first marriage. He deployed to the Middle East twice on 12 month tours while on active duty, once to Iraq and once to Afghanistan. He has also deployed twice to the Middle East with his present defense contractor employer (Tr. 27-31). Applicant's present monthly net income is approximately $5,000, $3,341 from his employer, $1,174 from the Veteran's Administration for a disability, and his wife's income of $600. Their monthly expenses are approximately $4,200 to $4,300, leaving about $700 to $800 monthly in discretionary funds. Applicant also works overtime each month which adds to his income (Tr. 34-38). Credit reports (Gov. Ex. 3, Credit report, dated January 12, 2009; Gov.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on \nMarch 12, 2008, as part of his employment with a defense contractor. On April 3, 2009, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 14, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 14, 2009. He admitted all seven \nallegations under Guideline F, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 28, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on June 18, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 30, 2009, \nfor a hearing on August 19, 2009. Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on August \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n3, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered four exhibits, \nmarked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his behalf and offered 11 exhibits, marked Applicant \nExhibits (App. Ex.) A - K which were received without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 25, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted the factual allegations under \nGuideline F.   \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and has been a lead technician with a defense \ncontractor for over two years. Applicant served seven years on active duty in the Army \nand three years in the Army Reserve. He started working for the defense contractor \nimmediately after leaving active duty. He is divorced, but has remarried, and has \ncustody of the two children from his first marriage. He deployed to the Middle East twice \non 12 month tours while on active duty, once to Iraq and once to Afghanistan. He has \nalso deployed twice to the Middle East with his present defense contractor employer \n(Tr. 27-31). Applicant's present monthly net income is approximately $5,000, $3,341 \nfrom his employer, $1,174 from the Veteran's Administration for a disability, and his \nwife's income of $600. Their monthly expenses are approximately $4,200 to $4,300, \nleaving about $700 to $800 monthly in discretionary funds. Applicant also works \novertime each month which adds to his income (Tr. 34-38).  \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 3, Credit report, dated January 12, 2009; Gov. Ex. 4, \nCredit report, dated March 28, 2008) reveal the following delinquent debts for Applicant; \na collection account for jewelry for $1,612 (SOR 1.a); a city electric bill in collection for \n$59 (SOR 1.b); a charged off account for a computer company for $1,177 (SOR 1.c); an \nautomobile repossession debt for $15,766 (SOR 1.d); a charged off credit card debt for \n$5,029 (SOR 1.e); a finance company debt charged off for $2,372 (SOR. 1.f); and a \ndebt to a government agency placed for collection for $6,756 (SOR 1.g). Applicant does \nnot have a debt for his Military Star Card as that debt was paid in full on June 8, 2007 \n(Tr. 20-21, App. Ex. H, Letter, dated June 3, 2009).   \n \nAs a young married soldier, Applicant did not pay sufficient attention to his \nfinances nor check his credit reports. At the end of his Army tour, he was in a no-pay-\ndue status so he was unable to pay his debts. He now has a steady income and he and \nhis present wife have a budget. He is following his budget and all of his present \naccounts are current (Tr. 31-34).  \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.a is a debt in collection for a jeweler. Applicant settled \nthis account for $900 and it has been paid in full (Tr. 14, 23; App. Ex. B, Bank \ntransaction, dated August 10, 2009; App. Ex. B, Check, dated July 10, 2009).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDelinquent debt 1.b is to a city utility. The debt was paid in full (Tr. 15, 23; App. \nEx. D, Account statement, dated February 26, 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt 1.c is for a computer. The debt was paid in full (Tr. 15-16; App. \nEx. E, Letter, dated April 29, 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt 1.d is the amount remaining on a car repossession. Applicant \nco-signed for another individual and that person defaulted on the loan. Applicant settled \nthe debt for $4,900. The initial payment of $1,500 and the first subsequent payment of \n$250 on the settlement plan have been paid (Tr. 16-18, 32-33; App. Ex. G, Settlement \nagreement and payment receipt, dated August 10, 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt 1.e is for a loan. Applicant has been making monthly payments \nof $206.69 for over a year and his payments are current (Tr. 20-21; App. Ex. I, Letter, \ndated June 3, 2009, and Payment transactions for May, June, July 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt 1.f is for a charged off loan of $2,372. The debt has been paid in \nfull (Tr. 21; App. Ex. J, Letter, dated August 12, 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt 1.g is for the balance due on a reenlisted bonus of $6,821 that \nwas being collected because Applicant left the Army earlier than anticipated. Applicant \nhas been paying this debt for some time and the payments are current (Tr. 25-26, 31-\n32; App. Ex. K, letter, dated June 3, 2009).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \n\n \n4 \n \n \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as listed on credit reports and admitted by \nApplicant are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).   \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was \n\n \n5 \n \n \nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), \nand FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) do not apply. Applicant has been steadily \nemployed with no periods of unemployment. He did not raise any unusual \ncircumstances that caused his delinquent debt. In fact, he attributes his delinquent debt \nto poor financial management. It is noted that he either paid or is paying his delinquent \ndebts so they do not cause doubt concerning his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, there \nmust be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a good-\nfaith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good-faith effort to pay them. Applicant paid four of the debts in full. He \nhas payment plans in effect on the remaining three debts and his payments under the \nsettlement agreements are current. He has not accumulated any additional delinquent \ndebts. He has a concrete sustainable plan to pay his remaining debts. Applicant \nmitigated security concerns based on his finances. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Appellant's over ten \nyears of active and reserve service in the Army including his two deployments to the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwar zones of the Middle East. I considered that he again twice deployed to the Middle \nEast for his defense contractor employer in support of the United States war effort.  \n \nAppellant has established a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. He is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that he paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that \nis required is that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and takes significant \naction to implement that plan. The entirety of his financial situation and his actions can \nreasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his plan to reduce his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about \nthe person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \nconcomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment by presenting \nsufficient information to show he paid four of the delinquent debts in full. He has \npayment and settlement plans in effect for the remaining three debts and his payments \nunder the plans are current. His present accounts are also current. He has sufficient \nmonthly income to meet his present obligations. Applicant demonstrated that his plan is \ncredible and realistic, and he is managing his finances responsibly under the \ncircumstances. The management of his present finances and his past obligations \nindicates he will be concerned, responsible, and not careless in regard to sensitive \ninformation. Appellant is not financially overextended and he is living within his means. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Appellant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He established that he is suitable for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Appellant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusions \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He is single and has no children. \n(Tr at 6-7; Gov 1)   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed that he had the following \ndelinquent accounts: a $1,307 medical account, placed for collection in September 2002 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 5 at 1); a $51 telephone account placed for collection in March 2008 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 26, 30; Gov 5 at 2); a $61 debt owed to an \napartment complex placed for collection in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at \n1; Gov 4 at 26; Gov 5 at 2); a $39 medical account placed for collection in September \n2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 27; Gov 5 at 2); a $218 cable \ntelevision account placed for collection in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 3; Gov 3 at \n1; Gov 4 at 27; Gov 5 at 2); and an $802 medical account placed for collection in \nSeptember 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 3; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 25; Gov 5 at 2). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $453 medical account placed for \ncollection in September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 4, 6; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 19, 31; \nGov 5 at 2); a $3,743 student loan account placed for collection in September 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 2 at 10; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 23; Gov 5 at 2); a $2,839 student loan \naccount placed for collection in September 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 2 at 10; Gov 3 at 2; \nGov 4 at 24; Gov 5 at 2); a $609 credit card account that was charged off in October \n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 2 at 2, 11; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 18); a $23 fitness gym account \nplaced for collection in April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 2 at 4; Gov 4 at 29); a $70 satellite \ntelevision account placed for collection in March 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 4 at \n30); a $221 insurance account placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 2 at \n5, 11; Gov 4 at 30); and a $150 medical account placed for collection in September \n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.o Gov 2 at 3; Gov 3 at 1).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn June 13, 2008, Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation. \nThe debts alleged in the SOR were discussed during the interview. Applicant did not \nrecall many of the accounts and indicated that he intended to investigate the accounts \nafter the interview. (Gov 4 at 7-9) \n \nAfter graduating from college, Applicant testified that he experienced three \nperiods of unemployment. On each occasion he was unemployed for several months. \n(Tr at 51) On his security clearance questionnaire, Applicant listed periods of \nunemployment from May 2000 to December 2003, when he was a college student and \nfrom August 1998 to September 1999. He did not list any periods of unemployment after \ngraduation. (Gov 1, Section 11)    \n \nApplicant provided proof that the following debts are paid:  SOR \u00b6 1.b, $51 \ntelephone collection account, resolved on October 27, 2009 (AE D); SOR \u00b6 1.e, $218 \ncable television collection account, resolved on November 5, 2009 (AE B); SOR \u00b6 1.l, \n$70 satellite television collection account, resolved on November 5, 2009 (AE I at 2); \nand SOR \u00b6 1.m, $221 insurance account placed for collection, resolved on November 4, \n2009 (AE C).  \n \nApplicant recently completed a loan rehabilitation program for the two delinquent \nstudent loan accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, $3,743 and 1.i, $2,839. He admits losing \ntrack of the two student loan accounts. The loans were transferred from the \nrehabilitation program in October 2009. (Tr at 32-44; AE E; AE F; AE G) He also \nrehabilitated some additional delinquent student loans that were not alleged in the SOR.  \n(Gov 4 at 12-14; AE F; AE H at 2) He claims that all of his student loan accounts are \nnow in good standing. He currently pays $50.31 a month towards the student loans \nalleged in the SOR.  He pays $108.57 a month towards the other student loans that he \nrehabilitated. He provided a statement, dated October 3, 2009, that indicated that he \nhad not made his payment for September 2009, and was one month past due. (Tr at 32- \n44, 61-66; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE H; Gov 4 at 12-14) \n \nThe status of the remaining accounts alleged in the SOR are:  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g medical debts in the amounts of $1,307, $39, $802, \n$453: Applicant claims the debts all relate to treatment received at a medical center in \n2002. He believes that some of the accounts may be duplicates. He is in the process of \narranging a payment plan. He intends to resolve these accounts as soon as he can, but \nno payment plan had been arranged at the close of the record.  The debts are \nunresolved. (Tr at 53-57) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, $61 collection debt owed to an apartment complex: Applicant states \nthis debt is from an apartment that he and a co-worker shared when he worked as a \nfield engineer for a previous employer. He denies that he is responsible for the debt. He \nclaims that his former employer is responsible for paying the debt. He claims he has \nbeen trying to contact the human resources department at his former employer to \narrange to have them pay the debt. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 58-60)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j, $609 charged off credit card account: Applicant denies this account. \nHe is not familiar with the account. He claims that he contacted the company and they \nwere not aware of the account\u2019s status and they do not have an account in his name. \nHe did not dispute the account with the credit reporting agencies and provided no \ncorroboration from the company that he does not have an account. The debt is \nunresolved. (Tr at 66-68) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k, $23 fitness account placed for collection: Applicant states that the \naccount is from a gym that he belonged to several years ago. He claims he called the \ncollection agency and they did not have an account in his name. He has no \ndocumentation to corroborate that he does not have an account. He has not disputed \nthe account with the credit reporting agencies. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 68-69) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o, $150 medical debt placed for collection: Applicant believes this debt \nis related to the medical bills incurred during treatment in 2002.  He admits the debt is \nunresolved. A credit report, dated April 3, 2008, shows that this debt was opened in \nApril 2007, in the state where Applicant was residing at the time. In 2002, Applicant \nlived in another state. This debt is not related to Applicant\u2019s medical treatment received \nin 2002. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 71; Gov 2 at 3) \n \nApplicant is unaware of having any other delinquent accounts. (Tr at 72) He is \ncurrent on his federal and state taxes. He has an extension for filing his state and \nfederal taxes for tax year 2009. He is not sure when the extension expires. (Tr at 82) He \ntestified that he had no credit cards other than a business credit card. He also testified \nthat he paid off some of his debts using a credit card over the phone. Under cross \nexamination, he admitted using his business credit card to pay off the personal \nexpenses. He claimed that his supervisor gave him permission to use his business \ncredit card to pay off some of his debts. (Tr at 77-79)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is $63,000. His net monthly income is $3,100. \nHis monthly expenses include: $1,050 rent; $400 groceries; $150 utilities; car payment \n$405; student loans $400. Applicant has not driven his car for the past year, but recently \nopened a car insurance account which will be $150 monthly. He claims that he has \nbetween $300 to $400 left over each month after expenses. On the day of the hearing, \nhe had $2,000 in his checking account. He has no savings. He claims that he used his \npension funds to pay off debts. He has not attended financial counseling. (Tr at 73-83; \nsee also Gov 4 at 3) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nApplicant answered, \u201cno\u201d in response to section 28 on his security clearance \napplication, dated March 17, 2008, which asks applicants whether they have had any \ndelinquent debts over 180 days with the past seven years, or are currently 90 days \ndelinquent on any debts. He omitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.o.  Applicant \nclaims that he did intend to deceive the government about his delinquent accounts. He \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclaims that he was unaware of his delinquent accounts. He was not diligent about \nkeeping track of his bills. (Tr at 72-73) \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits that he had four alcohol-related arrests \nbetween July 2, 2000, and October 28, 2006.  \n \nOn July 2, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol, Failure to Maintain a Single Lane, and Driving While License \nSuspended.  Applicant was a waiter at a restaurant. He went out for a few drinks after \nwork. He was driving home when the police pulled him over around 7:30 am. The police \nreport indicates that people in another car called police after observing Applicant\u2019s \nerratic driving. Applicant failed a field sobriety test. His blood alcohol content was .218 \nand .222.  He was driving on a suspended license for failure to pay a fine or insurance. \nOn January 19, 2001, Applicant pled guilty to Driving Under the Influence and Driving \nWhile License was Suspended or Revoked. He was sentenced to pay court costs of \n$341 and fined $500. He was given 12 months probation. He was required to attend \nDUI school; his driver\u2019s license was suspended for nine months; and he was ordered to \nperform 75 hours community service. (Tr at 84-89; Gov 6; Gov 7)  \n \nOn May 7, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with Disorderly \nIntoxication. Applicant went out drinking with a friend and his friend got into a fight. He \nand his friend were arrested. He thinks the charge was dismissed. The disposition of \nthis charge is unknown. (Tr at 90-91; Gov 6 at 1) \n \nOn December 13, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony battery. \nAfter a night out, Applicant got into a fight with his girlfriend. He hit her in the face \nultimately breaking her nose. Applicant admits to drinking that night but claims he was \nnot intoxicated. The police report states that Applicant\u2019s girlfriend stated that he was \nextremely intoxicated. They got into an argument when his girlfriend asked him why he \nwas always getting so drunk. Applicant got mad at her, told her to go home, and pushed \nher out of bed. Mutual pushing and shoving continued until Applicant hit her and her \nnose started bleeding. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend stayed with him all weekend. She went to \nthe hospital on Monday because her face was not getting better. Her nose was broken. \nOn May 18, 2004, Applicant pled to the lesser offense of misdemeanor battery, and \nadjudication was withheld. Applicant was placed on 12 months probation. He was \nordered to pay $1,035 restitution to his girlfriend. He attended anger management as \npart of his sentence. (Tr at 91-93; Gov 8);  \n \nOn August 11, 2006, a neighbor called the police around 4 am because they saw \nApplicant sleeping in his driveway. Applicant had been drinking that evening. He \ntestified that he drank about a six-pack of beer. He went outside to call his girlfriend and \nfell asleep while talking to her on the phone. He was not arrested. (Tr at 94-95, 104; \nGov 9) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOn October 28, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence. He was at a Halloween party and offered to drive some girls downtown. He \nwas stopped by police and failed a field sobriety test. On April 6, 2007, he was found \nguilty of the offense and sentenced to community service, 12 months probation, ordered \nto attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving seminar, and fined $500. (Tr at 95-96; Gov \n10 at 2) \n \nApplicant has not been arrested since October 28, 2006. He attended Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) classes in conjunction with each DUI sentence. He never attended AA \non his own. He does not believe that he has a drinking problem. He believes he made \nsome poor decisions when he was younger. He has never attended alcohol counseling \nor treatment. His drinking pattern is having a few beers with friends about once a week. \nHe anticipates about six drinks would make him intoxicated. The last time he was \nintoxicated was at a Halloween party on October 31, 2009. He has not driven after \nconsuming alcohol since his 2006 arrest. He has never experienced black outs. (Tr at \n100-103; Gov 4 at 6-7)  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, and 2.e were \nalso alleged under criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s alleged intentional falsification of his \nsecurity clearance application alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a is also alleged under criminal \nconduct. If the omission of his delinquent debts on his security clearance application is \nfound to be intentional, his conduct would be a criminal violation of Title 18, United \nStates Code, \u00a7 1001.  \n \nWhole Person Factors \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote a letter on his behalf. Applicant has been assigned \nto his team for over a year. Applicant\u2019s responsibilities include protecting a wide variety \nof controlled unclassified documents, business sensitive, and industry proprietary \ndocuments. He has performed responsibly and reliably in all of these assigned \nfunctions. The supervisor notes that Applicant has demonstrated he is a very \nprofessional member of the team. (AE A) Applicant was given an overall rating of \n\u201cmeets/occasionally exceeds expectations\u201d in his 2009 annual performance appraisal. \nHis appraisal indicated that he requires little oversight and is a self starter. Applicant has \ngood work habits and is a team player. (AE I at 3-7)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. From 2002 to 2008, Applicant incurred \n14 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $10,586.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept, 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. While \nApplicant provided proof that four of his debts with low balances were paid, the debts  \nwere paid between October 27, 2009, and November 5, 2009, a few weeks before his \nhearing. Some of the debts were paid with a credit card. His student loan accounts were \nrecently rehabilitated. However, eight delinquent accounts remain unresolved. While \nApplicant has taken steps to demonstrate that he is financially responsible, concerns \nremain based on his eight-year history of ignoring delinquent accounts. His failure to \ndevelop a plan for resolving his remaining delinquent accounts continues to raise \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. While Applicant testified \nthat he had three periods of unemployment after he graduated from college, he did not \nlist any periods of unemployment on his security clearance application other than when \nhe was a college student. Even if he encountered periods of unemployment, he has \nbeen employed in his current position since September 2007. He continued to incur \ndelinquent accounts while in his current job. His payment of four debts with low \nbalances appears to be a last minute gesture rather than a demonstration that he now \nbehaves responsibly towards his debts. I cannot say that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. It was and is within his discretion to take control of his financial \nsituation.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. Eight \ndelinquent debts remain unresolved. Given his past history of financial neglect, it is \nunlikely that his financial situation will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.e, 1.l, and 1.m. Applicant provided proof that these accounts were paid. The \ndelinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are found for Applicant because \nhe provided proof that he rehabilitated the student loan accounts and they are now \ncurrent. However the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.o are \nunresolved and Applicant has no plan as to how he intends to resolve these accounts. A \npromise to pay in the future is not sufficient to demonstrate a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue debts. He took no steps towards resolving his remaining eight delinquent \naccounts even though each debt\u2019s balance is relatively low and within his means to \nresolve.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) has the potential to apply with regard to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.j, and \n1.k because Applicant disputes that the debts are his responsibility. However, he \nprovided no additional evidence to substantiate the basis for the dispute or provided \nevidence for actions taken to resolve the issue such as formally disputing the debts with \nthe credit reporting agencies. FC MC \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s recent payments of four of his debts and his recent \nrehabilitation of his delinquent student loan accounts provide some mitigation under \nfinancial considerations, it is not enough to overcome the concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \neight-year history of financial irresponsibility. Applicant has not mitigated the concerns \nraised under Guideline F.    \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. The following disqualifying conditions are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nAlcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. \nFrom July 2000 to October 2006, Applicant was involved in five alcohol-related \nincidents. He has two DUI convictions, a disorderly conduct arrest, and a battery \nconviction which occurred after a night of consuming alcohol. Although he was not \narrested, the police were called to his home in the early morning hours of August 11, \n2006, because concerned neighbors observed him passed out in his driveway.  \n \nAC DC &22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the person is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent) applies. Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related incidents indicate that \nhe drinks alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. While the record evidence does not \ncontain any formal diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol-related incidents raise security concerns.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While Applicant \ntestified that he no longer drinks and drives, he continues to consume alcohol to the \npoint of intoxication. The last time he drank to the point of intoxication was on October \n31, 2009, at a Halloween party, less than two weeks before the hearing. While there is \ninsufficient record evidence to conclude Applicant is an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent, his past history of demonstrated poor judgment while drinking alcohol raises \na concern. The fact that he still drinks alcohol to the point of intoxication does not \nmitigate the concern. Applicant\u2019s alcohol use still casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.    \n \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under alcohol \nconsumption. Guideline G is found against Applicant.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n11 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nOn his security clearance questionnaire dated March 17, 2008, Applicant \nanswered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 28a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over \n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28b, \u201cAre you currently 90 days delinquent on \nany debt(s)?\u201d even though he had delinquent debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.o. \nApplicant testified that he was unaware of his delinquent accounts when he completed \nthe security clearance questionnaire. He was not deliberately trying to hide the fact that \nhe had delinquent accounts from the government. He was just not diligent about \nkeeping track of his bills. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) \n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) potentially applies to Applicant\u2019s case. I find that it does not apply \nbecause Applicant did not intentionally falsify his security clearance questionnaire by \nomitting his delinquent accounts. I find Applicant\u2019s testimony that he did not list the \ndelinquent accounts because he was unaware of them to be credible. His inattention to \ndetail is what created his financial problems. Guideline E is found for Applicant.  \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe SOR alleges four arrests and charges which were previously alleged under \nthe alcohol consumption concern. There are several Criminal Conduct Disqualifying \nConditions (CC DC) which apply to Applicant\u2019s case, CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious \ncrime or multiple lesser offenses) and CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted). As mentioned in the alcohol consumption section, above, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with criminal offenses on four occasions from July \n2000 to August 2006. He has two DUI convictions, the first occurring in July 2000, and \nthe second conviction in August 2006. He had a May 2004 arrest and charge of \nDisorderly Intoxication, the disposition of that offense is unknown. In December 2004, \nhe was arrested and charged with felony battery after he broke his girlfriend\u2019s nose \nduring an argument. He pled to misdemeanor battery.  \n \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and    \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement) apply. More than three years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last arrest on \nOctober 28, 2006. He has had no further criminal violations. He currently has a good \nemployment record. There is evidence of successful rehabilitation with regard to \nApplicant\u2019s past criminal conduct.  \n \nI find for Applicant with respect to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 4.b which alleged \ncriminal conduct because Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance \nquestionnaire by omitting his delinquent debts in response to section 28.  I found he did \nnot intentionally falsify his security clearance questionnaire. As a result, there is no \nviolation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, a federal criminal statute.  \n \nThe Criminal Conduct concern is mitigated. \n   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s past history \nof alcohol-related offenses, financial irresponsibility, and criminal conduct. I considered \nthe favorable comments of his supervisor and his favorable evaluation report. While \nApplicant rehabilitated his delinquent student loan accounts and resolved four of his \naccounts, eight debts remained unresolved. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that he was taking steps to resolve those accounts. The criminal \n\n \n13 \n \n \nconduct concern is mitigated because Applicant has not been arrested and charged \nwith a criminal offense in over three years. Alcohol conduct concerns are not mitigated \nbecause Applicant still drinks alcohol to the point of intoxication. The last time he drank \nto intoxication was less than two weeks before the hearing. His past history of alcohol-\nrelated incidents and the fact that he continues to drink to intoxication does not mitigate \nthe alcohol consumption concerns. He did not intentionally falsify his security clearance \napplication when he omitted his delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s history of financial \nirresponsibility and alcohol-related incidents raise serious issues about his ability to \nprotect classified information. Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct concerns are \nfound for Applicant. Financial Considerations and Alcohol Consumption are found \nagainst Applicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJanuary 22, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP), on June 12, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On April 3, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) concerning the\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 5, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non May 28, 2009. I received the case assignment on June 1, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 2, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August\n4, 2009. Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received\n\nThis allegation was numbered \u201c1.c\u201d in the SOR at page 2, and was the second so numbered. It was\n1\nrenumbered \u201c1.d.\u201d to avoid confusion. The allegations in the SOR originally numbered \u201c1.d. \u201c through \u201c1.g.\u201d\nin the SOR have been renumbered \u201c1.e. through \u201c1.h.\u201d\n2\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits\nA through D, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing, and the record closed, on August 17, 2009. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 57, and single. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to\nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR. Those admissions\nare hereby deemed findings of fact. \n1.a.\nApplicant admits that a judgment was entered against him in the amount\nof approximately $12,649. This judgment was entered in 2004. While Applicant admits\nthe existence of this judgement, he was unable to provide the name of the creditor. This\ndebt has not been paid, and he has no current intentions to pay this debt. (Government\nExhibits 3-6; Transcript at 40-43.)    \n1.b.\nApplicant admits that he was indebted to a department store in the amount\nof $79. He submitted documentary evidence showing that he has paid this debt. This\nsubparagraph is found for the Applicant. (Applicant Exhibit C; Transcript at 44.)\n1.c.\nApplicant admits that a judgment was entered against him in the amount\nof approximately $10,216. This judgment was entered in 2004. This debt has not been\npaid, and he has no current intentions to pay this debt. (Government Exhibit 3;\nTranscript at 44.)    \n    \n1.d.\nApplicant admits that a judgment was entered against him in the amount\n1\nof approximately $1,236. This judgment was entered in 2003. This debt has not been\npaid, and he has no current intentions to pay this debt. (Government Exhibit 3;\nTranscript at 44.)    \n1.e.\nApplicant admits that a judgment was entered against him in the amount\nof approximately $10,891. This judgment was entered in 2006. The Applicant paid this\njudgment pursuant to a garnishment on his wages. This allegation is found for the\nApplicant. (Government Exhibit 3; Applicant Exhibits A and B; Transcript at 44.)    \n\n3\n1.f.\nApplicant admits that he owes a debt to a creditor in the amount of $1,513.\nThis account was opened in 2000 and has been delinquent since at least 2002.\nApplicant has not paid this debt and has no current plans to pay this debt. (Government\nExhibit 3; Transcript at 44-47.)\n1.g.\nApplicant admits that he owes a debt to a creditor in the amount of $1,965.\nApplicant has not paid this debt and has no current plans to pay this debt. (Government\nExhibit 3; Transcript at 47.)\n1.h.\nApplicant admits that he owes a debt to a creditor in the amount of $2,234.\nApplicant has not paid this debt and has no current plans to pay this debt. (Government\nExhibit 3; Transcript at 47.)\nDuring his testimony, the Applicant stated that he was unable to pay his past due\ndebts because all of his money goes to pay his monthly expenses and remain current\non his active credit accounts. He attributes much of his financial difficulty to getting\ndivorced in 1999, and subsequently helping his two children financially as they went\nthrough college. He hopes to file bankruptcy within five or six months, once he saves\nthe money required for the filing fee. (Government Exhibit 2; Transcript at 30-38, 47-52.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, has over $29,000 in past due debts,\nall of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\n\n5\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ The Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties are of a longstanding nature. As stated above, he has paid off two of\nhis debts. One was very small, and the other was paid through a garnishment.\nHowever, the evidence is meager as to how he is going to pay his remaining past due\ndebts. It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that this mitigating\ncondition applies to this case.  He has not done so.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g.,. . . divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  Applicant and his wife were divorced in 1999. He indicates that the\ndivorce exacerbated his financial situation. However, there is scant evidence in the\nrecord to conclude that he has acted responsibly since then. With the available record, I\ncannot find, under these particular facts, that the Applicant has acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances.\nApplicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors, or otherwise\nresolve the debts.  There is no track record of his making payments for a consistent\nperiod of time.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he\nis at least $29,000 in debt, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is under financial\nstrain, and has been for several years. His debt situation is not yet under control. Under\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I\n\n6\ncannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nAccordingly, at the present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8)), and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence\n(AG \u00b6 2(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation at\nthis time.  If he is able to pay down his debts, or otherwise resolve them, he may be\neligible for a clearance in the future.  He is not eligible now.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied 12 Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.d., 1.i., 1.j., 1.l., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., 1.r., 1.t., 1.u., and 1.w.). The allegations were corroborated in credit reports in the record, which were marked as Items 3, 7, and 8. Eight of the allegations that Applicant denied were based on information she supplied in response to Question 28 on her e-QIP, which was marked as Item 4 in the record. The following record evidence establishes Applicant\u2019s responsibility for the delinquent debts that she denied: SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Item 8 at 2; Item 3 at 48-49, 59); SOR \u00b6 1.d.

Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on May 27, 2008. On April 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing   \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested that her \ncase be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its File \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nof Relevant Material (FORM) on July 16, 2009. The FORM contained documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated July 16, 2009, DOHA forwarded a copy \nof the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or \nobjections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on July 20, 2009. Her \nresponse was due on August 19, 2009. She did not submit any information within the \nrequired time period. On October 8, 2009, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 24 allegations of financial delinquency under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.x.). In her Answer to the SOR, dated May 21, \n2009, Applicant admitted 12 of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.k., 1.m., 1.n., 1.s., 1.v., and 1.x.). Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare admitted herein as findings of fact.  \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied 12 Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b., \n1.d., 1.i., 1.j., 1.l., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., 1.r., 1.t., 1.u., and 1.w.). The allegations were \ncorroborated in credit reports in the record, which were marked as Items 3, 7, and 8. \nEight of the allegations that Applicant denied were based on information she supplied in \nresponse to Question 28 on her e-QIP, which was marked as Item 4 in the record. The \nfollowing record evidence establishes Applicant\u2019s responsibility for the delinquent debts \nthat she denied: SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Item 8 at 2; Item 3 at 48-49, 59); SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Item 8 at 2; \nItem 7 at 10; Item 3 at 26, 51-52, 62); SOR \u00b6 1.i (Item 7 at 4; Item 3 at 13); SOR 1.j. \n(Item 4 at 37; Item 7 at 5,7; Item 3 at 60); SOR \u00b6 1.l.

(Item 4 at 34-35; Item 8 at 2; Item 7 at 10; Item 3 at 24, 51, \n62); SOR \u00b6 1.t. (Item 9 at 2; Item 7 at 11; Item 3 at 26, 52, 62); SOR \u00b6 1.u. (Item 4 at 36; \nItem 7 at 11); and SOR \u00b6 1.w. (Item 4 at 38; Item 7 at 12).   \n \n \nApplicant, who is 29 years old, has been employed since October 2007 as an \nelectrical designer by a defense contractor. She has never been married. She is the \nmother of two children. Her daughter was born in 2002, when she was in a relationship \nwhich has since dissolved. She entered a second relationship in about 2005, and her \nson was born in 2006. Applicant currently lives in a spouse-like relationship with her \nson\u2019s father. The household also includes her partner\u2019s daughter. (Item 3 at 3-4; Item 4.)  \n \n \nIn January 2009, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories and provided a \npersonal financial statement. She reported that her net monthly income from salary was \n$2,177. She reported that her partner\u2019s net monthly salary was $1,210. She also \nreported that she received $248 each month in child support. Applicant\u2019s total net \nmonthly household income was $3,635. (Item 5 at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly fixed expenses are as follows: rent, $900; groceries, $344; \nclothing, $20; utilities, $420; car expense, $191; insurance, $3.60; medical expense, \n$6.00; and alimony/child support/day care, $676, for a total of $2,560.60. (Item 5 at 5.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant owes about $1,200 in student loans. She pays $51 each month on her \nstudent loan debt. In her financial statement she identified the student loan debt as \n\u201ccurrent debts\u201d and stated: \u201cAll other debt is past due debt not currently paying on.\u201d She \nreported a monthly remainder of $1,024. (Item 5 at 5.)  \n \n  \nThe delinquent debts alleged on the SOR total $23,430. In explanatory materials \nshe provided with her answer to the SOR, Applicant reported that she was in good \nstanding with her creditors until 2001, when she became pregnant and lost her job. She \nwas unemployed for at least two months. In May 2002, her automobile was \nrepossessed, and she owed a delinquency of $7,042. The delinquent automobile debt is \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.l. and has not been satisfied. Applicant reported the repossession \non her e-QIP. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt and stated that it \nwas no longer on her credit report. (Item 1; Item 3 at 1, 3; Item 4 at 33.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties continued. She separated from her daughter\u2019s \nfather and found it difficult to make ends meet as a single parent. She moved to a new \ncommunity in 2005 in order to find a better job. In 2006, she became pregnant again \nand decided to live with her current partner. She remained at home for a time to care for \nher two children and her partner\u2019s child. Her partner found work but was soon laid off. In \nthe spring of 2007, Applicant applied for her current job. She was hired in October 2007. \n(Item 3 at 3-4.) \n \n \nApplicant has worked hard at her job as an electrical designer. In a letter to \nDOHA in January 2009, she reported that she would receive a bonus of $750 in \nFebruary 2009. She also reported that she had filed her 2008 income tax return and \nexpected to receive a refund of $4,200. She stated that she intended to use her bonus \nand her tax refund to pay her delinquent debts.  (Item 6 at 2.) \n \n \nOf the delinquent debts alleged on the SOR, four were debts of less than $100 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n., 1.q., 1.s., and 1.w.). Seven delinquent debts alleged on the SOR were in \namounts between $100 and $300 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.k., 1.o., 1.p., 1.r., 1.u., and 1.v.). Two \ndelinquent debts alleged on the SOR were in amounts between $600 and $700 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.m.). Three additional delinquent debts were for larger amounts: SOR \u00b6 \n1.g. ($3,279), SOR \u00b6 1.h. ($6,913), and SOR \u00b6 1.l ($7,042). (Item 1.) \n \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant paid or settled two of her delinquent debts \nin February 2009: the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j. ($311) and the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.o. ($255.) \n  \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed she had made arrangements to pay \nthe debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k. and 1.m. However, she failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate her assertions. (Item 3 at 1-2.) \n \n  \nApplicant claimed she had contacted the national credit bureaus and her state\u2019s \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to dispute several of the debts alleged on \nthe SOR. In her answer to the SOR, she claimed to have disputed the debt alleged at \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nSOR \u00b6 1.b., but she also reported that the credit bureaus concluded that the debt was \nhers, and, as a consequence, she was contemplating possible legal action.1 She \ndisputed SOR \u00b6 1.d. as \u201cnot accurate. She claimed she filed a dispute with the national \ncredit bureaus to contest the debt alleged SOR \u00b6 1.f. as \u201coutside the statute of \nlimitations for [her] state,\u201d but the credit bureaus did not find in her favor and she was \ncontemplating possible legal action. She also claimed she disputed the delinquent \nmedical debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p., 1.r., and 1.t. because they were incurred when \nshe had medical insurance. (Item 3 at 1-2.) \n \n \nApplicant also denied responsibility for the delinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.l., 1.q., 1.u., and 1.w. because they no longer appear on her credit reports. She \nclaimed that she had disputed the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.w. as erroneous, and, as a \nresult, the credit bureaus had removed it from her credit reports. Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport of March 6, 2009, corroborates her claims that she initiated disputes regarding \nthe delinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.p., 1.r., and 1.t. However, she provided \nno documentation to support her assertion that she disputed the medical debts alleged \nat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p., 1.r., and 1.t. with her state Department of Health and Human Services, \nnor did she provide documentation to corroborate her claim that she filed disputes with \nthe national credit bureaus regarding the delinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.f., \n1.i., and 1.w.  (Item 3 at 1-2; Item 8)     \n \n  \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that she consulted a workplace \ncounselor and had \u201creceived advice and guidance on how [to] remedy [her] financial \nsituation.\u201d She also stated she had spoken with a mortgage banker about repairing her \ncredit so that she could purchase a home \u201cin the near future.\u201d (Item 3 at 2.)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n1 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i was a duplicate of the \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, she did not provide documentation to corroborate her claim.  (Item 3 \nat 1.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions could apply to Appellant\u2019s case. If the financially \ndelinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might apply. If \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply. If \u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply. If \u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d then \nAG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least 2001 and \n2002. Her delinquencies are recent and on-going. They have occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur.  \n \nApplicant reported that she was fired from a job in 2001 and was unemployed for \nat least two months. In subsequent years, she and her partners have experienced some \nfinancial hardship and voluntary and involuntary unemployment. However, she has \nbeen steadily employed by her present employer since October 2007. In her financial \n\n \n7 \n \n \nstatement of January 2009, she reported a monthly remainder of $1,024. In \ncorrespondence with DOHA in January 2009, she stated that she planned to use her \n$4,200 income tax refund and her yearly bonus of $750 to pay her delinquent debts. \nDespite having the resources to pay or settle many of her smaller delinquent debts, \nApplicant provided evidence to corroborate payment of only two of the 24 debts alleged \non the SOR. The record does not reflect that the circumstances that gave rise to her \ndelinquencies were beyond her control. Applicant has made promises to pay or settle \nmost her debts in the future. However, in determining an individual's security \nworthiness, the Government cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might \nresolve his or her outstanding debts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  \n \nWhile Applicant spoke with a counselor about her financial situation, she failed to \nprovide clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. Additionally, she argued that the statute of limitations in her state precluded the \ncollection of some of the debts alleged on the SOR. Applicant\u2019s argument reflects a \nmisunderstanding of the responsibilities required of one who is trusted to protect \nclassified information. Indeed, DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has emphasized that \u201creliance on \nthe non-collectability of a debt does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the debt \nwithin the meaning of the Directive.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 07-16841 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2008). \n \nApplicant asserted that she had disputed several of her delinquent debts. Her \ncredit report corroborated that she had disputed four debts alleged on the SOR. She \nalso asserted that several other debts had been removed from her credit report as the \nresult of her disputes. However, she provided no documentation to corroborate the \nstatus of the debts that were no longer listed on her credit reports, and she failed to \nprovide documentation to substantiate the disputes or whether they had been resolved. \n \n I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. I also \nconclude that while Applicant receives some credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(e), the partial application of these mitigating conditions is insufficient to mitigate the \nfacts of her case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has obviously worked hard \nto excel at her work. Her employer has appreciated her efforts and has recognized them \nwith a bonus. However, she has failed to pay or satisfy the majority of her financial \ndelinquencies, many of which are several years old. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies occurred when she was a mature \nadult. She failed to satisfy her creditors even when she had sufficient funds to do so. \nShe promised to pay her debts at some time in the future, but she has failed to put \nforward plans which show that she and her creditors have agreed to specific payments \nat specific times to satisfy her indebtedness. She has also argued that some of her old \ndebts are no longer legally collectible. Her failure to take affirmative action to pay or \nresolve the majority of her delinquent debts continues to raise security concerns about \nher judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application of the\npertinent mitigating conditions was erroneous and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nThe Judge found that Applicant is an employee of a defense contractor.  He is married.  He\nhas significant delinquent debts for such things as consumer purchases, medical expenses, telephone\nbills, credit cards, etc.  Applicant enjoys a reputation for conscientiousness and reliability.  The Judge\nnoted that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were affected his wife\u2019s illness.  However, the Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  Specifically,\nthe Judge stated that Applicant had not demonstrated a track record of responsible actions in regard\nto his many debts.  \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to consider his family\u2019s circumstances and his security\nhistory.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge has considered all the record evidence.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App.\nBd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s arguments are insufficient to rebut that presumption.  Furthermore,\nthe Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s circumstances.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the\nJudge failed to consider the pertinent record evidence.   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nOctober 9, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on February 1, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On February 3, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on March 18, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non April 15, 2009. I received the case assignment on April 16, 2009. DOHA issued\nnotices of hearing on April 22, 2009, and June 2, 2009. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on June 15, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through\n\n2\n8, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and\nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D, which were received without objection. The\nApplicant requested the record to remain open for a period for the presentation of\nadditional documentary evidence. He submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E on June 26, 2009,\nand it was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on\nJune 23, 2009.  The record closed on June 26, 2009. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 55 and married. He is employed by a defense contractor, and\nseeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his\nemployment in the defense industry. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he\nis financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Applicant admits subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.i., 1.o., 1.p.,\n1.q., 1.r., 1.s., 1.t., 1.u., and 1.v. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nHe denied subparagraphs 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., and 1.w. All\nof the debts are supported by credit reports submitted by the Government or by the\nApplicant. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5 at 9-19, and 6.)\nThe Applicant submitted that his financial problems began in 2000, when his wife\nfell seriously ill with what was eventually diagnosed as diabetes and Hepatitis C. In\naddition to her illness, and the medical bills, the Applicant moved several times in the\nfollowing years in order for his wife to obtain medical care, or for her to be closer to their\nchildren. Each of these moves cost money and, for several months in 2004, he was\npaying the mortgage on a house in one state while also paying rent on a house in a\nsecond state. In addition, at one time or another in the last few years, all three of the\nApplicant\u2019s daughters and their children have lived with him and his wife. This is\nbecause of various family issues. (Transcript at 31-33, 63-65.)\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he has paid debts\nthat were not alleged in the SOR, but were of concern to the Government. In addition,\nhe recently paid a debt to a credit card company through payroll deduction, giving him\nmore money to pay other debts. (Transcript at 34-35; Government Exhibit 5 at 6-7;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, and E at 2.)\nThe Applicant also stated that he had not paid anything off on his debts since the\nmiddle of 2008. (Transcript at 71.) In addition, he stated several times that he does not\nunderstand his true debt situation, and has to do more research with his creditors.\n(Transcript at 52, 60-61, 71-72.) More specifically, the Applicant discussed his difficulty\n\n3\nwith determining what he owes in connection with his wife\u2019s medical bills. (Transcript at\n35-37.)\n1.a. The Applicant admits that he filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the\nBankruptcy Code in 1997. He received a discharge of all of his dischargeable debts in\nSeptember 1997. He testified that this bankruptcy was the result of an ongoing conflict\nwith an automobile company. (Transcript at 41-42; Government Exhibit 7.)    \n1.b. The Applicant admits that a judgment was entered against him in 2006 for\nthe amount of $2,323.24 plus fees. This was in relation to an apartment the Applicant\nrented at that time. The Applicant alleges that the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer said that the\njudgment would be resolved using the Applicant\u2019s security deposit. The Applicant and\nthe law firm have been in written communication. The law firm states that, after applying\nthe Applicant\u2019s security deposit, he still owes $1,595.03. The Applicant has made no\npayments on this debt, and has no current plans to make payments on this debt.\n(Transcript at 43-49; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 4, 7.)\n1.c. The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency for a medical\ndebt in the amount of $60.  He testified that he was uncertain as to the nature of this\ndebt and whether it has been paid. The Applicant has made no payments on this debt,\nand has no current plans to make payments on this debt.  (Transcript at 50-51.)   \n1.d. The Applicant denied that he owes a bank $972. He states that he does not\nknow whether the account is his or not. A credit bureau report submitted by the\nApplicant shows that he has disputed this account information. (Transcript at 51-53;\nGovernment Exhibit 5 at 10.) Based on the state of the record, this allegation is found\nfor the Applicant.\n1.e. The Applicant denies that he owes a second bank $2,154. He testified that\nhis understanding was that he had paid that debt off. However, he also stated he did not\nunderstand the nature of the debt. The Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report does not show\nthat he has disputed this debt. (Transcript at 53-54; Government Exhibit 5 at 10.)\n1.f. The Applicant denies that he owes a third bank $1,520. He testified that he\nnever had an account with that bank. The Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report does not\nshow that he has disputed this debt. (Transcript at 54-55; Government Exhibit 5 at 10.)\n1.g. The Applicant denies that he owes a collection agency $195 for a medical\nbill. The Applicant testified about this debt, \u201cI need to pursue that and see what that is.\u201d\nThe Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report does not show that he has disputed this debt.\n(Transcript at 55-56; Government Exhibit 5 at 11.)\n1.h. The Applicant denies that he owes a second collection agency $1,329 for a\ntowing service. He testified, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is or where it came from.\u201d The\nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau report does not show that he has disputed this debt.\n(Transcript at 56; Government Exhibit 5 at 11.)\n\nThe monetary total in SOR allegation 1.s. is made up of five separate bills.\n1\n4\n1.i. The Applicant admitted that he owed an automobile credit company $6,998\nfor a past due debt. He testified that the vehicle had been repossessed by the dealer.\nThe most recent credit bureau report show that there is currently no deficiency on this\ndebt. Based on the available record, this allegation is found for the Applicant.\n(Transcript at 38-41; Government Exhibits 5 at 11-12, and 6 at 3.)\n1.j. The Applicant denies that he owes a third collection agency $106 for a mobile\ntelephone bill. He testified that he never had a phone from this company. The\nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau report does not show that he has disputed this debt.\n(Transcript at 56-57; Government Exhibit 5 at 12.)\n1.k. The Applicant denied that he owed a utility $1,030 for a past due account.\nHowever, he testified that he is currently making payments on the arrearage. The\nGovernment\u2019s most recent credit bureau report confirms that he is making payments on\nthis debt. (Transcript at 57-58; Government Exhibit 6 at 3.) This allegation is found for\nthe Applicant.\n1.l. The Applicant denies that he owes a fourth collection agency $134 for a\nsecond utility bill. He testified, \u201cI paid that off I thought.\u201d He has done nothing to\ninvestigate the status of this debt. The Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report does not show\nthat he has disputed this debt. (Transcript at 58; Government Exhibit 5 at 14.)\n1.m. and 1.n. The Applicant denies that he owes a second mobile telephone\ncompany $264 and $149 for two past due bills. He testified that he had paid off this\ncreditor. He has done nothing to investigate the status of these debts. The Applicant\u2019s\ncredit bureau report does not show that he has disputed either of these debts.\n(Transcript at 59; Government Exhibit 5 at 14.)\n1.o., 1.p., 1.q., 1.r., and 1.s. The Applicant admitted that he owed a fifth collection\nagency $929 in total for nine hospital bills.  The Applicant testified that he was not sure\n1\nwhich of these bills were still owing and which had been paid off. The available credit\nreports do not show that he has disputed any of these debts. (Transcript at 59;\nGovernment Exhibit 4 at 14-16, 5 at 12-13, and 6 at 1-2.)\n1.t. The Applicant admitted that he owed a sixth collection agency $65 for a\nhospital bill. The Applicant testified that he was not sure which of his medical bills were\nstill owing and which had been paid off, including this one. The available credit reports\ndo not show that he has disputed this debt. (Transcript at 59-60; Government Exhibit 4\nat 10.)\n1.u. and 1.v. The Applicant admitted that he owed a seventh collection agency\n$338 in total for two hospital bills. The Applicant testified that he was not sure which of\nthese bills were still owing and which had been paid off. The available credit reports do\nnot show that he has disputed either of these debts. (Transcript at 59-60; Government\nExhibit 4 at 12-13.)\n\n5\n1.w. The Applicant denies that he owes a store $344 for a credit card bill.\nConcerning this debt he testified that he did not know what the debt was for and would\nhave to look into it. He has done nothing to investigate the status of this debt. The\nGovernment\u2019s most recent credit bureau report does not show that he has disputed this\ndebt. (Transcript at 60; Government Exhibit 6 at 2.)\nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits C and D are professional references from co-workers.  Both\nof the correspondents state that the Applicant is a conscientious and reliable person.\nThey recommend him for a position of trust.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be considered as appropriate in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Security clearance decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, as shown by the evidence and his own admissions,\nhas over $9,900 in past due debts, all of which have been due and owing for several\nyears. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 2000 and 2005.  However, he does\nnot have a reasonable plan to pay the past due indebtedness.  I have considered the\nfact that the Applicant has paid several of his debts. That being said, the evidence\nshows he has done nothing in the past year to resolve any of his remaining past due\n\n7\ndebts. An earnest desire to pay debts is not a reasonable substitute for action.  It is the\nApplicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that his financial situation has improved.\nHe has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., . . . unexpected medical emergency. . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant had to make some hard decisions\nbecause of his wife\u2019s illness. That certainly exacerbated his financial situation. However,\nthe fact remains he has done little, if anything, to resolve the vast majority of his debts,\nincluding filing disputes with the credit reporting agencies. With the available record, I\ncannot find, under these particular facts, that the Applicant has acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances.\nThe Applicant has barely initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.  As\nstated under Findings of Fact, above, subparagraphs 1.d, 1.i., and 1.k. are found for the\nApplicant.  There is no track record of his making payments for a consistent period of\ntime.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, he is $9,900 in debt without a\nreasonable plan to resolve any of it. Accordingly, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6\n20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making this decision: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a respected person\nwho is under financial strain, and has been for several years.  The medical condition of\nhis wife, and his payment of some of his bills, has been considered. However, taking all\nof the evidence into account, he has not made a sufficient showing that his debt\nsituation is under control.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based\n\n8\non the state of the record, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral\nchanges under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I also find that there is\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)), and that there\nis a strong  likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation at this time.  He is not currently eligible for a security clearance.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e.:\nAgainst  the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1..f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.i.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j.:\nAgainst  the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.o.:\nAgainst  the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.s.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.t.:\nAgainst  the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.v.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.w.:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn February 15, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non March 19, 2009. On March 23, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the \nhearing for April 7, 2009. The case was convened on that date. The administrative \njudge continued the case because Applicant did not receive the Notice of Hearing within \n15 days as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. The case was transferred to me on May 15, \n2009. On June 1, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nJune 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nJune 16, 2009. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5 without objection. Applicant testified and offered three \nexhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 C without objection. The \ntranscript was received on June 24, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old security officer employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the \ndefense contractor since March 2008. He also works another full-time job as a security \nofficer at a community college. He takes college classes part-time and hopes to obtain a \nnursing degree. From December 1995 to December 1999, he served on active duty in \nthe United States Marine Corps as a diesel mechanic. He received an Honorable \nDischarge. He was originally a citizen of Trinidad. He became a U.S. citizen in 2001. \nThis is his first time applying for a security clearance. He is married and has four  \nchildren, ages 16, 14, 6 and 5.  The two older children are his wife\u2019s children from a \nprior marriage.  Applicant adopted them. (Tr at 5-8, 25-27; Gov 1) \n   \nOn April 2, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to question 27(b) which asks whether \nthe applicant has had any property repossessed within the past seven years, he listed  \na mortgage foreclosure in March 2008. (Gov 1)  A subsequent background investigation \nconfirmed that Applicant had two outstanding judgments entered against he and his wife \nrelated to home foreclosures.  On January 30, 2008, a judgment was entered against \nApplicant and his wife in favor of a bank in the amount of $301,253.77. This is the \nmortgage foreclosure Applicant listed on his e-QIP application. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2) On \nApril 23, 2008, a judgment was entered against Applicant and his wife on behalf of a \nhome loan company in the amount of $336,932.77. (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 3; Gov 4 at 3; Gov \n5 at 3) The second foreclosure occurred after Applicant completed the e-QIP \napplication. The two foreclosures are the basis of the SOR. \n \nAfter Applicant separated from active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps in December \n1999, he initially drove a truck and tried to attend school. In December 2000, he got a \njob as a mail carrier with the U.S. Postal Service. He worked for the Postal Service until \n2004. In November 2004, Applicant and his family moved to the southeastern part of the \nU.S. because of his oldest son\u2019s severe asthma. (Tr at 28; Gov 1, section 11) \n \nFrom November 2004 to June 2005, Applicant worked as a loan originator for a \nmortgage company.  He and his wife both obtained real estate licenses. From June \n2005 to September 2006, he worked as a sales associate (i.e. realtor) for another \nmortgage company. In September 2006, Applicant and his wife opened their own real \nestate business which they operated out of their home. (Tr at 28-30; Gov 1, section 11) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAt some point, Applicant and his wife began to invest in real estate in the \nsoutheastern part of the U.S.. They started to invest in real estate during a period when \nthe real estate market was booming and credit was easy to get. Things initially went \nwell. They made a profit on the first home that they purchased. They used the money to \ninvest in other properties. Then the economy and the real estate market in the \nsoutheastern part of the U.S. crashed. Applicant and his wife tried to rent the properties. \nThey took out a home equity loan on their own home in order to meet payments. They \nwere able to make house payments for a period of six months to a year but eventually \nhad to let the mortgages go to foreclosure. Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant \nand his wife had a third investment property that recently went to foreclosure. (Tr at 29 \u2013 \n33, 38 \u2013 39; Answer to SOR) \n \nOn June 10, 2009, Applicant and his wife filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. \nTheir listed assets total $798,761. (The assets listed include the foreclosed mortgage \nproperties.) Their listed liabilities total $1,128,419.06. The majority of the debts consist \nof the three properties that were foreclosed. During the past year, Applicant and his wife \nrelied on credit cards to pay expenses as well. These accounts never became \ndelinquent but are included in the bankruptcy. Applicant anticipates the bankruptcy will \nbe completed in September 2009. (Tr at 13, 40-41, 48; AE A; AE B; and AE C) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that other than the home foreclosures, he \nand his wife were never late on any of their other debts. (Tr at 36) Credit Reports, dated \nJanuary 6, 2009, and May 9, 2008, support this assertion. (Gov 4; Gov 5)  \n \nApplicant works from 6:30am to 2:30pm on Monday through Friday at his job at \nthe community college. He works from 3:00 pm to 11:00 pm at his job with the defense \ncontractor. He attends class on Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings. He pays for \nhis classes with the GI Bill. He and his wife still have their real estate business but \nbusiness is minimal. His wife intends to look for employment once their youngest child \nbegins school in September 2009. (Tr at 43) \n \nApplicant and his wife are required to take two financial counseling courses in \nconjunction with their bankruptcy filing. They completed the first course on-line and will \nsoon complete the second course. They have had no other financial counseling. (Tr at \n46-47)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $3,466. His wife\u2019s net monthly income is \napproximately $150. Their mortgage payment is $1,800. They have two automobiles. \nOne is paid for. The other, a 2007 Toyota Camry, is going to be surrendered during the \nbankruptcy. Applicant states that his finances will become more stable once the \nbankruptcy is complete. He now states that investing in real estate was a stupid \ndecision. He and his wife are attempting to rebuild their finances. (Tr at 35, 37, 48-51) \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nApplicant and his wife had a high debt-to-income ratio as a result of their real estate  \ninvestments. After the real estate market in the southeastern U.S. crashed, they were \nunable to pay the mortgages on their three investment properties.   \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s three \nmortgage foreclosures occurred within the past year. He filed for bankruptcy a few \nweeks ago. The behavior was too recent to conclude this mitigating condition applies. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. However, it is noted that all of Applicant\u2019s other financial \naccounts were current prior to filing for bankruptcy. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \n\n \n6 \n \n \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nresulted from a downturn in the real estate market. Things were good for awhile but \nthen the local real estate market collapsed. Applicant and his wife attempted to keep \nthings afloat but eventually had to let three of the homes be foreclosed. Aside from the \nmortgage foreclosures, Applicant was current on his remaining financial obligations. He \nacted reasonably under the circumstances when he decided to file for bankruptcy. It \nwould have been impossible for Applicant to repay the balance owed after the \nforeclosures were complete. He works two full-time jobs to support his family which \nshows an industrious work ethic.     \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies. Applicant is required to attend two financial counseling sessions as a \ncondition of his bankruptcy. He completed one course and will soon complete the next \ncourse.  His financial situation will stabilize after his bankruptcy is complete in the fall \n2009.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Bankruptcy is a legitimate way to resolve \none\u2019s debts. Applicant filed for bankruptcy because of the losses suffered from his real \nestate investments. Aside from these foreclosed mortgages, Applicant was current on \nhis other financial obligations. While Applicant did not demonstrate the best judgment by \ngetting in over his head in real estate investments, the banks gave him the loans to \npurchase the property even though his income was insufficient to qualify for the loans. \nHe has learned a valuable lesson and is taking the steps within his power to rectify the \nsituation.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nservice in the United States Marine Corps. I considered the fact that he works two full-\ntime jobs to support his family and attends college classes part-time. I considered the \nprincipal factor causing his financial problems was the downturn in the local real estate \nmarket. I considered that aside from his three mortgage foreclosures, Applicant was \ncurrent on his financial accounts. By filing for bankruptcy, Applicant has taken steps \ntowards resolving his financial situation. Admittedly, he did not make the best decisions \nwhen purchasing homes that he could not afford. However, based on the particular facts \nof this case, Applicant has presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 19, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn August 19, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\n\n\u201c[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\n1\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains a discussion of his past financial problems, the difficulties\nhe has encountered in dealing with them, the efforts he has made in attempting to resolve his\nfinancial delinquencies, and his career accomplishments.  Some of the matters discussed by\nApplicant are reiterations of evidence presented and argued at the hearing.  Other matters discussed\nby Applicant and documents submitted with the appeal brief are not included in the record below.\nThe Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The Board construes\nApplicant\u2019s appeal as raising the issue of whether the Judge should have concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems are mitigated.  \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of Guideline F, Mitigating Condition 2  at\n1\nsome length, noting Applicant\u2019s motorcycle accident and resulting unemployment were beyond his\ncontrol.  However, the Judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that\nApplicant acted prudently in monitoring and resolving his financial difficulties in the six years since\nthe accident.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the record as are the Judge\u2019s conclusions\nabout the applicability of the other mitigating conditions and his whole person analysis.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd.

The action\nis based on a history of financial problems, which Applicant has just begun to address\nthrough a June 2009 bankruptcy case with more than $100,000 in debts. The record\ncontains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns\nstemming from his history of financial problems, which are ongoing and unresolved.\nAccordingly, as explained in detail below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nAugust 19, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then\nmodified by the Defense Department, and made effective September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They\nsupersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.  \n By mutual agreement, the Directive extends to many other federal agencies, to include the Justice\n2\nDepartment. Directive, \u00b6 2.2. \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on February 19, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F for\nfinancial considerations. The SOR also recommended submitting Applicant\u2019s case to an\nadministrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke a security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about March 18, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on May 4, 2009. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on June 17, 2009. The government presented documentary exhibits (Exhibits\n1\u20135) and called no witnesses. Applicant presented documentary exhibits (Exhibits A\u2013H),\ncalled one witness, and testified on his own behalf. The transcript (Tr.) was received\nJune 25, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was mixed. The SOR alleged 23 delinquent debts\nfor a total of about $156,000. He admitted $79,000 in delinquent debts and asserted\nthat many of the debts were duplicates. His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee who works for a federal contractor that\nprovides services to the Drug Enforcement Administration, an agency of the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice.  He has worked for his current employer, or its predecessor in\n2\ninterest, since he was 19 years old. He has been continuously employed for many years\nexcept for about a six-month period in 2003\u20132004, as discussed below, when he was\nout of work without income due to a dirt-bike accident. He is married, and he and his\nwife have two children, ages 21 and 10, both of whom reside in Applicant\u2019s household.\nHe is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in February 2008 (Exhibit\n1). It required him to disclose information about his background, to include his financial\n\n3\nrecord. In response to a question about financial delinquencies, Applicant reported\nmany medical accounts and stated that he was in the process of filing for bankruptcy. \nCredit reports from 2008 and 2009 establish that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems (Exhibits 2\u20135). For example, the trade section of the April 2008 credit\nreport has 52 accounts of which 36 are listed as in collection or past due (Exhibit 5).\nThe collection section of the same report has ten collection accounts with a total\nbalance of about $54,000. \nApplicant admitted making no payments toward any of the accounts in the SOR\n(Tr. 71\u201372). Likewise, Applicant and his wife admitted having no documentation to\nsupport the claim of account duplication in the SOR (Tr. 42, 70). Applicant agreed that\nthe debts in the SOR are credit card debts or medical debts (Tr. 71). Applicant also\nagreed that he allowed himself to become disconnected from his family\u2019s finances and\nshould have played more of a role, but held back to show his wife he trusted her despite\nevidence of financial problems (Tr. 84\u201385). \nIt appears that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to a combination of: (1) a\ndirt-bike accident in September 2003, which resulted in a fracture to his pelvis, surgery,\nhospitalization, and unemployment without income for about six months; (2) his wife\u2019s\nmishandling of their finances, to include multiple incidents of transferring  balances from\none credit card account to another, hiding mail, and misrepresenting the full extent of\nthe situation; and (3) Applicant\u2019s insufficient attention or deliberate ignorance or both to\nhis financial responsibilities. Applicant\u2019s spouse consulted with a bankruptcy attorney for\nthe first time in 2007, but action was not taken at that time. Applicant found out about\nthe consultation in late 2007 or early 2008 because he noted a pending bankruptcy\ncase in his February 2008 security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). Applicant learned\nmore about his financial problems in about May 2008, when his spouse wrote him a\nletter revealing what she had done and failed to do (Tr. 67\u201368). \nIn a June 3, 2009, letter, Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney advised that Applicant\nand his spouse had retained his office and that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case would be\nfiled by June 12, 2009 (Exhibit A). At the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife explained that she\nunderstood the case was converted from a Chapter 7 liquidation case to Chapter 13\nwage earner\u2019s plan with a repayment plan calling for monthly payments for 60 months\n(Tr. 50\u201352). She indicated that the Chapter 13 case was filed the day before the hearing\n(Tr. 51). Other than the letter, Applicant did not present any paperwork associated with\nthe bankruptcy case (e.g., the petition, summary of schedules, schedules, repayment\nplan, etc.). Nevertheless, both Applicant and his spouse agreed that the bankruptcy\ncase will address approximately $194,000 in debts, which includes a home mortgage\nloan (Tr. 52, 80\u201381). \nApplicant estimates his gross earnings for 2009 at about $36,000 (Tr. 70). He\nand his wife had less than $100 in the bank as of the date of the hearing (Tr. 79\u201380).\nHis wife had a 401(k) account from a previous employer, but she liquidated it to pay\nbills. Applicant has a 401(k) account with a balance of about $40,000. Last year, he\n\n Department of Navy v.

She was not working when Applicant had the accident in 2003\nand when he was out of work. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n3\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n4\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n5\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n6\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met\n13\nthe strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security\nclearance.\nAnalysis\n1.\nThe record contains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems.\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n15\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n Revised Guidelines at p. 14 (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n18\n6\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems raises concerns because it indicates\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial\n16\nobligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. Taken together, (1) Applicant\u2019s\n17\nadmissions to the SOR allegations, (2) the four credit reports, and (3) the testimony\nabout the indebtedness included in the bankruptcy case, show that Applicant has\ndelinquent debts in excess of $100,000. These facts and circumstances are more than\nsufficient to establish the two disqualifying conditions noted above, and it suggests\nfinancial irresponsibility as well.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns as follows:  \n18\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none are sufficient to\nmitigate and overcome the security concerns. The most pertinent is MC 2, which\nrecognizes the situation when bad things happen to good people. Certainly, Applicant\u2019s\ndirt-bike accident in 2003 and the resulting unemployment fall into this category.\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 1\u20132. \n19\n7\nApplicant was still largely uninformed of his family\u2019s financial situation at this time, but\nhe was not irresponsible by trusting and accepting that his wife had matters under\ncontrol. It is insufficient to fully mitigate the concerns, however, because Applicant\u2019s\ninjury and unemployment took place six years ago. Moreover, Applicant should have\nbeen more aggressive in monitoring or verifying his family\u2019s financial situation when he\nsaw the warning signs. MC 3 deserves consideration as well, but it does not apply.\nAlthough Applicant and his spouse received the benefit of the bankruptcy attorney\u2019s\nadvice, there are no clear indications that the problem is resolved or under control.\nWhether it is a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, it was just filed in June 2009,\nand it is likely still pending at the bankruptcy court. It is premature to make any\njudgments about the consequences (positive or negative) of Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy\ncase.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not minor, and they are ongoing and\nunresolved. The bankruptcy case was only recently filed. If it is a Chapter 13 case, it is\npremature to determine if Applicant will obtain a discharge upon completion of all\npayments under the Chapter 13 plan. Given these circumstances, it is also too soon to\ntell if Applicant will resolve his outstanding delinquent debts in a reasonable time and\nthen continue to be a financially responsible person. At this time, the likelihood of\nadditional or continuing financial problems cannot be ruled out. Accordingly, Guideline F\nis decided against Applicant.  \n2.\nThe whole-person concept does not support a favorable decision. \nI also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept, which requires\nan administrative judge to evaluate a person\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the\nperson\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider\nthe nine factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n19\nApplicant is an experienced and mature individual who should be able to handle\nhis financial obligations. He has a good job and earns a decent salary. He has good\nintentions and wants to resolve his indebtedness. These circumstances weigh in his\nfavor. Also weighing in his favor is his good employment record (Exhibits D\u2013H). But a\ngood employment record, by itself, is not sufficient to mitigate the concerns. \n\n8\nWith more than $100,000 in delinquent debts, Applicant faced a serious problem.\nHe chose bankruptcy as a remedy, which is a lawful means to address indebtedness.\nBut resort to bankruptcy also indicates how unmanageable or out-of-control or both his\nfinancial problems had become. Although the origins of his financial problems were\nlargely beyond his control, it appears the problems were compounded over time by his\ninsufficient attention or deliberate ignorance or both to his financial responsibilities.\nBased on this record, Applicant cannot place all the blame on his spouse. Without a\nwell-established record of financial responsibility\u2014which is lacking here\u2014the clearly-\nconsistent standard and Egan require an unfavorable decision.\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.w:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.    \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement security concern arising from his \nlong-term use of five illegal drugs. He mitigated the personal conduct security concern. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 16, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On April \n14, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance, citing security concerns under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nDecember 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nJanuary 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and it recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether eligibility should be granted, denied or \nrevoked. \n \nOn April 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 9, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 15, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on July 23, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1, which \nwas admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJuly 31, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations, except for SOR \u00b6 2.d, which he denied. \nHis admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of \nthe evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old assistant project manager working for a defense \ncontractor. He attended college at a prestigious U.S. university, and received a \nBachelor of Science (electrical engineering) degree in 2005. He has never been \nmarried.  \n \nApplicant started using marijuana illegally around 1997-1998, when he was \nattending 8th grade, at age 14-15. He initially used marijuana out of curiosity and \nbecause he was immature. He continued to use marijuana with varying frequency all the \nway through high school and college. He estimated he used marijuana 60 or more times \nfrom January 1997 through April 2006. During this period, Applicant also purchased and \nsold marijuana. Applicant graduated from college in December 2005. Between January \nand April 2006, he went back to college to visit with his friends. During this period, he \nused marijuana and cocaine infrequently. \n \nApplicant described his use of cocaine as opportunistic. His college roommate \nand other friends used cocaine, and Applicant would share their cocaine when offered. \nHe used cocaine approximately four to five times from about July 2001 through April \n2006. \n \nApplicant illegally used mushrooms approximately three times from about \nJanuary 2000 through March 2004 (Tr. 79). However, Applicant illegally possessed \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmushrooms until around May 2007. In April 2006, Applicant was working for a \ncontractor in a supervisory position. He accepted mushrooms as collateral for a $60 \nloan he made to a subordinate employee. When Applicant\u2019s supervisor asked him \nwhether he had purchased or accepted illegal mushrooms from a subordinate, Applicant \nlied to retain his job (Tr. 56). Applicant claimed he threw away the illegal mushrooms in \nMay 2007, when he found the mushrooms during a house move. \n \nApplicant used ecstasy approximately three to four times from about January \n1999 through April 2002. He used prescription pain pills without a prescription \napproximately ten to twelve times form January 1999 through June 2006. This was \nApplicant\u2019s last use of any illegal drug.  \n \nApplicant knew that his use of drugs was illegal. Applicant continues to associate \nwith many of his drug-using friends, most of whom he has known since high school, for \napproximately 12 years. Applicant admitted being in contact with the college roommate \nwho used to provide him with cocaine, and with many other friends with whom he used \nillegal drugs. He was in contact with his drug-using friends until at least around \nDecember 2008. He claimed that even though he knew many of his friends used illegal \ndrugs in the past, he does not know whether they currently use illegal drugs.  \n \nIn November 2000, at age 18, Applicant applied for a service delay-entry \nprogram, seeking to be admitted into a nuclear program job. He wanted to follow up on \nthe footsteps of other family members serving their country in the military. As part of the \napplication process, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. In his answer \nto question 27 (asking whether since age 16, or in the last seven years, he had illegally \nused any controlled substance, including: marijuana, cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, and \nmedications without prescription), he answered \u201cYes\u201d and disclosed he used marijuana \nonly twice from 1999 to 2000. He deliberately failed to disclose the full extent and \nfrequency of his use of marijuana, cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, and medications \nwithout prescriptions, as discussed above.  \n \nApplicant claimed that his falsification was the result of his immaturity, his lack of \nunderstanding of the forms, and his not knowing the full extent of the consequences of \nhis falsification. He was concerned that if he disclosed his drug use he would be \nrejected from the delay-entry program. Thus, he falsified the application.  \n \nApplicant also deliberately falsified material facts in his May 23, 2001, sworn \nstatement, on security paperwork he submitted in 2003, and in a statement he provided \nto a Federal Bureau of Investigations agent during an interview in 2003. He admitted \nthat in each of these occasions, he provided false statements to be consistent with the \nfalsification he made in his November 2000 security clearance application. He was \nconcerned he would not be considered for a job position if he disclosed the full extent of \nhis drug use. Notwithstanding his rejection concerns, and that he was aware of the \nillegality of his drug-related behavior, Applicant continued to use drugs until at least \nJune 2006. Furthermore, he possessed mushrooms until at least May 2007. In 2003, \nwhen Applicant made his false statements, he was working part-time in the security \n\n \n4 \n \n \noffice of a nuclear power plant. He claimed that he abstained from drugs while working \nat the power plant. \n \nIn his April 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed, on his own \nand without being prompted, the full extent of his drug use, that he had falsified his \nNovember 2000 security application, and that he made false statements to security \npersonnel in 2001 and twice in 2003. He also disclosed he failed a drug test while he \nworked in a nuclear program in 2001. Applicant testified that he corrected his \nfalsification because he did not want to continue lying. He expressed remorse about his \npast falsifications. He wanted to correct his mistakes, provide honest answers in his \nApril 2008 security clearance application, and have a fresh start.  \n \nApplicant recognized he has made poor choices in the past that place his \njudgment in question. He averred that he has matured since April 2006. He has a stable \nrelationship with his girlfriend whom he has known for three years. She does not like \ndrugs. They have a dog, he purchased a home, and he has a good job with a future. He \nwould like to continue serving the United States by working with government \ncontractors. He does not need a security clearance for his current job, but would need it \nif he is promoted to be a project manager  \n \nApplicant promised never to use illegal drugs again, and stated his intent never \nto violate the law again. He also submitted a statement of intent to never use illegal \ndrugs in the future with automatic revocation of his security clearance for any violation \n(Tr. 91, AE 1). \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer from January 2008 to the present. \nHe testified that he is considered to be an above-average employee. Based on his \nreferences\u2019 statements, he is considered an outstanding employee, hard working, \ndedicated, responsible, and diligent. None of his references, except for his girlfriend, are \naware of Applicant\u2019s past drug use. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d1 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern about drug involvement: \n \n \n1  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions related to drug involvement that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions raise a security concern and are disqualifying in this particular case: AG \u00b6 \n25(a): \u201cany drug abuse\u201d;2 AG \u00b6 25(b): \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use\u201d; AG \u00b6 25(c): \n\u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, \nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and AG \u00b6 25(g): \u201cany illegal drug \nuse after being granted a security clearance.\u201d \n \nBetween 1997 and May 2007, Applicant illegally used, possessed, and \npurchased drugs with varying frequency. He stopped using illegal drugs in June 2006, \nbut possessed mushrooms until at least May 2007. His behavior triggers the \napplicability of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c), and 25(g).3 The other disqualifying conditions \nlisted in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n \n2  AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n3  AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Cocaine and methamphetamine are Schedule II Controlled Substances. See 21 U.S.C \u00a7 \n812(c)II(a)(4) (cocaine), and II(c) (methamphetamine); United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458 (2nd Cir. \n2008) (cocaine); United States v. Wheeler, 535 F.3d 446 (6th Cir. 2008) (methamphetamine).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find none fully apply. \nApplicant\u2019s long-term history of illegal drug use is recent. He has used drugs for most of \nhis adult life. It was part of Applicant\u2019s lifestyle until at least May 2007, with his long-time \nhigh school and college friends. He possessed mushrooms until May 2007. He \ncontinues to associate with his drug-using friends.  \n \nApplicant receives credit for his two and one-half-year period of abstinence. He \nalso receives credit for his signed statement of intent not to use illegal drugs with \nautomatic revocation of eligibility for a security clearance for any violation. \nNotwithstanding, considering Applicant\u2019s long-term history of illegal drug use and his \ncontinued association with drug-using friends, his period of abstinence is not sufficient to \nshow that his questionable behavior is not likely to recur. Applicant has not participated \nin any drug counseling or rehabilitation program. I find the drug involvement concerns \nare not mitigated.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on his 2000 security clearance \napplication when he failed to disclose the full extent and frequency of his use of \nmarijuana, mushrooms, ecstasy, and medications without prescription. Applicant also \ndeliberately falsified material facts in his May 23, 2001, sworn statement, on security \npaperwork he submitted in 2003, and in a statement he provided to a Federal Bureau \nInvestigator during an interview on 2003. He provided false statements to be consistent \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwith the falsification he made in his November 2000 security clearance application. He \nlied because he was concerned he would not be considered for a job position, or fired, if \nhe disclosed the full extent of his illegal drug use. Applicant continued to use illegal \ndrugs after he submitted his 2000 application and provided the three false statements. \nNotwithstanding his concerns, Applicant continued to use drugs until at least June 2006, \nand possessed mushrooms until May 2007. \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions create security concerns under two disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\u201d \nand 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nApplicant receives credit for disclosing the full extent of his drug use (sua sponte) \nin his April 2008 security clearance application. He also disclosed that he had falsified \nhis November 2000 security application, that he made false statements to security \npersonnel in 2001 and twice in 2003, and that he failed a drug test while he worked in a \ngovernment agency nuclear program. Applicant did not want to continue lying, and he \nexpressed remorse about his past falsifications. He wanted to correct his mistakes and \nprovide honest answers in his April 2008 security clearance application. At his hearing, \nApplicant was candid and forthcoming about his drug-use history. \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications are serious offenses (felony). Notwithstanding, his \nvoluntary disclosures of his past falsifications show maturity and his willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules and regulations. His recent behavior also demonstrates good \njudgment.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well educated \nman. He has been working for a defense contractor since January 2008. He is \nconsidered to be a valuable employee and is being groomed for a higher leadership \nposition. He is considered to be hard working, dedicated, responsible, and diligent. He \n\n \n10 \n \n \nhas a reputation as a trustworthy and honest person. There is no evidence of any \nsecurity violation. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, there are more substantial circumstances that weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis. He has been illegally using, possessing, and \npurchasing drugs with varying frequency since the 1997. When he started working with \na government agency in 2000, he was aware of what was required of him to be eligible \nfor a security clearance. He deliberately continued his use of illegal drugs \nnotwithstanding his knowledge of the legal and moral consequences of his action. He \nfalsified his security clearance application and made three false statements because of \nhis concerns about the adverse effects such information would have on his professional \nreputation and ability to hold a government job. Notwithstanding, he continued to \nillegally use drugs until at least June 2006, he possessed mushrooms until May 2007, \nand he continued to associate with his long-time drug-using friends until around \nDecember 2008.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug-related behavior raises doubts about his suitability to have \naccess to classified information and his willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his drug involvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",
