    "summary": "findings of fact that reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-09892 (July 15, 2004) at p. 5. A Judge must \u2013 of practical necessity \u2013 weigh the record evidence, decide what evidence is credible and persuasive, and make findings of fact concerning controverted factual issues. ISCR Case No. 02- 31428 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2006). 8 Accordingly, I have considered the entire polygraph report (AE C), including the report\u2019s narrative \u201cpreparation & interview phase\u201d and the Applicant\u2019s responses to specific questions in the \u201ctesting phase\u201d and the \u201cevaluation phase.\u201d I give little persuasive value to the \u201cevaluation phase\u201d of the report, as the examiner\u2019s data interpretation, opinions and conclusion are not conclusively determinative of the issues addressed in the report and do not serve to outweigh other record evidence. Private Counterintelligence Assessment Applicant\u2019s privately obtained counterintelligence assessment report (AE D) is problematic in several areas. First, the qualification of the \u201cexpert\u201d consultant (assessor) is not fully developed. Although the expert was \u201cretained\u201d by Applicant\u2019s counsel to prepare a counterintelligence assessment, it is unclear whether the assessor is still a Federal employee or in the business of preparing assessments for profit. Next, the report does not fully develop the expert\u2019s qualifications, including specific education and training, and the length and specificity of experience. Rathe",

Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines M (Use of \nInformation Technology) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 22, \n2017. On October 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines M and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions \nissued on or after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 31, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2020. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on February 10, 2020, \nfor a hearing to be convened on March 24, 2020. However, the hearing was canceled \ndue to COVID-19-related cessation of travel and courtroom availability. \nOn July 23, 2020, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a motion to withdraw Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a hearing due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and requested a \ndecision based on the administrative record. He submitted his intended exhibits with his \nmotion. On July 27, 2020, Department Counsel opposed the motion pursuant to DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Additional Procedural Guidance \u00a7\u00a7 E3.1.7 and E3.1.8, and requested \na hearing. \nOn July 29, 2020, I denied Applicant\u2019s motion and discussed the options of holding \na hearing in a DOHA hearing room, the possibility of future travel to Applicant\u2019s location, \nor a video teleconference if one could be arranged. A video teleconference was arranged \nand a Notice of Video Teleconference was sent to the parties on September 4, 2020, \nnotifying them of a hearing to be held on Monday, September 14, 2020. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through O \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified at the hearing, but did not introduce any \nadditional documentary evidence or witnesses. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on September 28, 2020. \nEvidentiary Issues \nOn September 11, 2020, Department Counsel submitted a motion in limine to \nexclude AE C and D (comprised of AE C-private exculpatory polygraph examination \nreport and AE D-private counterintelligence assessment). That same afternoon, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested, via email, an opportunity to submit a post-hearing \nresponse to the motion as the hearing was scheduled for the following Monday. No \nresponse was submitted since the motion was decided in Applicant\u2019s favor at the hearing. \nThe video teleconference hearing was held as scheduled. \nI denied Department Counsel\u2019s motion in limine at the hearing, and noted my intent \nto admit the documents in question into evidence, and to weigh them appropriately in my \ndecision. In closing arguments, Department Counsel renewed his objection to the reports\u2019 \nconclusions. He argued that the documents were (1) impermissible hearsay, (2) that the \ncredibility of the \u201cexperts\u201d was not established, (3) that Applicant seeks to substitute the \n\u201cexpert\u2019s\u201d judgment for that of the Administrative Judge, and (4) that the presentation of \npolygraph evidence goes beyond the Government\u2019s ability to present similar evidence \nbecause of the prohibition in previous versions of the DOD Credibility Assessment \nProgram directive1  on the acceptance of polygraph and credibility assessments (PCA) \nexaminations or results from non-Federal PCA examiners. \n1  DOD Directive 5210.48 (April 24, 2015) (Incorporating Change 2, Effective October 1, 2020).

AE C was prepared by the Director of Quality Control Standards \nand Regulations (Examiner), for a private polygraph examination company, employed \nsince September 2019. He also noted he holds a current position as a \u201cfederal contract \npolygraph examiner\u201d for another private company since July 2018, stating he performs \ncounterintelligence polygraphs for DOD and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \n(NCIS).  The examiner previously served as a polygraph examiner for another company, \nand as a counterintelligence and security officer for DOD and the Central Intelligence \nAgency (CIA) from 2008 to 2018. \nAE D was prepared by a private consultant who briefly described himself as an \n\u201cexpert consultant\u201d; a graduate of the United States Naval Academy; U.S. Marine Corps \nveteran; and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent since 1997, specializing \nas a counterintelligence specialist and behaviorist. He noted his \u201cadvanced training and \nexperience in the area of social psychology and the practical application of the science \nbehind relationship development and trust.\u201d He also stated \u201cI ultimately lead (sic) the FBI\u2019s \nelite Behavioral Analysis Program.\u201d It is unclear whether the consultant is still an FBI \nemployee. \nNeither party produced the polygraph examiner or counterintelligence consultant \nto testify at the scheduled hearing. \nPrivate Exculpatory Polygraph Report \nThe polygraph examination report (AE C) included a section labeled \u201cpreparation \n& interview phase,\u201d comprised of a narrative of an initial oral brief Applicant provided to \nthe examiner and a narrative of Applicant\u2019s responses to a pre-test interview conducted \nby the examiner. In general, Applicant discussed the facts related to his company\u2019s \ninvestigation of his use of a company computer to view pornography. \nThe second section is labeled \u201ctesting phase,\u201d which included the test objective, \ntest procedure, and relevant test questions. Three questions were asked related to \nApplicant\u2019s answers on his September 2017 SCA. The questions included: \nCredibility Assessments (PCA) examinations and/or results of such examinations that are conducted by \nFederal PCA examiners.\u201d The 2018 and 2020 versions of the Directive eliminated this language. \n2  DOD Instruction 5210.91 provides that \u201cDOD polygraph examiners and PCASS [Preliminary Credibility \nAssessment Screening System] operators shall neither perform examinations nor participate in PCA-\nrelated activities in connection with non-duty employment. DoD Components authorized to conduct PCA \nexaminations may grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis, when there is no conflict of interest.\u201d Although \nthe examiner\u2019s CV indicates that he is a current Federal contract polygraph examiner, no information was \nprovided as to his Government approval for non-duty employment and a review of his conflict of interest \nstatus. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1. When you filled out the e-QIP we discussed, was your purpose to hide \nthat investigation from future employers? \n2. When you filled out the e-QIP we discussed, were you purposely trying \nto prevent disclosure of that investigation? \n3. When you filled out the e-QIP we discussed, did you deliberately falsify \nyour answer about the introduction of unauthorized media? \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to each question. \nFinally, the last section labeled \u201cevaluation phase,\u201d which is comprised of the \nexaminers technical analysis of the test data, and his \u201cprofessional opinion\u201d as to the \nApplicant\u2019s truthfulness. The examiner concluded that Applicant had \u201cno significant \nresponse,\u201d and opined that the Applicant was \u201ctruthful.\u201d \nPolygraph examinations are widely used within the Government and serve a useful \nfunction when combined with other information to form an opinion as to the credibility of \nan applicant. In security eligibility cases, they may not be a substitute for the evaluation \nand judgment of the administrative judge in light of the totality of the evidence. \nIn DOHA hearings, relevant and material evidence may be received into evidence \nsubject to rebuttal, and technical rules of evidence may be relaxed to permit the \ndevelopment of a full and complete record. Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, \u00a7 \nE3.l.19.3 Unlike military courts-martial,4 there is no per se rule against the introduction of \nprivate polygraph examination results by applicants in DOHA hearings.5 In some states, \nintroduction of polygraph evidence in criminal cases is barred by statute, while in others, \nit is expressly permitted. Within the parameters of law and regulation, an applicant in \nDOHA proceedings has the right to seek to present polygraph evidence that he or she \nbelieves is relevant and material to a defense to the Government's case against the \napplicant. ISCR Case No. 96-0785 (App. Bd. Sep. 3, 1998) However, polygraph evidence \nis not universally accepted as reliable. United States v. Scheffer, 532 U.S. 303 (1998). In \nScheffer, the Supreme Court noted that there is simply no consensus that polygraph \nevidence is reliable. To this day, the scientific community remains extremely polarized \n3 The [Appeal] Board has cautioned against a strict application of the Federal Rules of Evidence in these \nproceedings. See e.g. ISCR Case No. 97-0202 (January 20, 1998) at p. 2. ISCR Case No. 96-0785 (App. \nBd. Sep. 3, 1998). \n4  United States v. Scheffer, 532 U.S. 303 (1998). (The case presented the question whether Military Rules \nof Evidence (MRE) 707, which makes polygraph evidence inadmissible in court-martial proceedings, \nunconstitutionally abridges the right of accused members of the military to present polygraph evidence to \nrebut an attack on the accused credibility. The Court held that the exclusion of such evidence does not \nviolate the accused\u2019s right to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.) \n5  As noted by the DOHA Appeal Board, the [Scheffer] Court did not pass judgment on the accuracy, \nreliability, or fairness of polygraph tests, and, the Administrative Judge is required to consider whether an \napplicant seeking to present polygraph evidence demonstrates its accuracy, reliability, and fairness. ISCR \nCase No. 96-0785 (App. Bd. Sep. 3, 1998). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout the reliability of polygraph techniques. Scheffer 532 U.S. 303 at 309 (citations \nomitted).6 \nThe Scheffer Court reviewed some of the scientific literature on the reliability of the \npolygraph exam, citing one study which found polygraph assessments of truthfulness to \nbe \"little better than could be obtained by the toss of a coin.\" Scheffer 532 U.S. 303 at \n310. Although the Scheffer Court noted that most jurisdictions banned polygraph \nevidence altogether, it also cited some Courts of Appeals which left exclusion of such \nevidence to the discretion of district courts under the Supreme Court\u2019s Daubert test for \nthe admissibility of expert testimony. The Court noted however, \u201c[w]hatever their \napproach, state and federal courts continue to express doubt about whether such \nevidence is reliable.\u201d Scheffer 532 U.S. 303 at 312 (citations omitted). \nBecause of the unique nature of polygraph evidence, the Federal courts have \nrecognized the need to consider various issues raised by polygraph evidence when the \nparties have not stipulated to its admissibility and when a per se bar does not exclude the \nevidence. Those issues include but are not limited to: \n(1) Are the results of the polygraph test relevant and material to the issues of \nthe case? \n(2) Is the probative value of the proffered polygraph evidence outweighed by the \namount of time and resources that would be needed to decide its admissibility? \n(3) Has the party proffering the polygraph evidence given the other party \nsufficient notice to adequately prepare to respond to the proffered polygraph \nevidence? \n(4) Has there been a showing that a proffered witness is qualified to give \ntestimony about the reliability of polygraphs? \n(5) Has there been a showing that there is validity and reliability to polygraph \nexaminations? \n(6) Has there been a showing that the polygraph examination in question was \nconducted by a qualified polygrapher, using proper techniques, in a proper \nmanner? \n(7) Is the proffered polygraph evidence complete? \n(Citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 96-0785 (App. Bd. Sep. 3, 1998) \n6 Scheffer was decided by a divided Court. A four-justice plurality and four-justices concurring, with one \ndissent, held that the military exclusion of polygraph results did not unconstitutionally abridge the accused\u2019s \nrights. Four Justices were not convinced that polygraph test results should be excluded in the federal \nsystem because of concerns over usurping the jury\u2019s responsibility to decide ultimate issues in the case. \nEight Justices agreed with the statement raising doubts about the scientific community\u2019s acceptance of the \nreliability of polygraph techniques. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFederal criminal courts have questioned the admissibility and probative value of \nprivate polygraph examinations, and have expressed concern about trials \u201cdevolving into \nan evidentiary free-for-all.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Catalan Roman, 368 F. Supp. 2d \n119 at 121 (D.P.R. 2005). For example, after reviewing a district court\u2019s extensive \nanalysis of the reliability of polygraph evidence, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit agreed that the defendant\u2019s private polygraph evidence did not satisfy the Daubert \nstandards, and was therefore inadmissible. United States v. Cordoba, 194 F.3d 1053 (9th  \nCir. 1999); cert. denied, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 2804 (2000). \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit noted in 2011: \nResults from a unilateral polygraph examinations [sic] have little probative \nvalue. See United States v. Sherlin, 67 F.3d 1208, 1217 (6th Cir. 1995) \n(concluding that the defendant's \"privately commissioned polygraph test, \nwhich was unknown to the Government until after its completion, is of \nextremely dubious probative value\"). The defendant has no adverse interest \nat stake because a polygraph examination administered without notice to \nand participation by the Government \"carries no negative consequences, \nand probably won't see the light of day if a defendant flunks.\" (citation \nomitted) Applying the balancing test set forth in Federal Rule of Evidence \n403, courts have routinely deemed inadmissible, evidence related to \nunilateral polygraph examinations. (citation omitted) Moreover, the \nadmission of the proposed evidence would have necessitated collateral \nproceedings regarding the validity of a unilateral polygraph examination. \nAccordingly, the polygraph evidence was properly excluded. United States \nv. Montgomery, 635 F.3d 1074, 1094 (8th Cir. 2011) \nEven in Federal criminal cases in which the penalty is far more ominous than in \nDOHA cases, exculpatory polygraphs have been excluded. For example, a defendant in \nthe capital-sentencing phase of his trial after convictions for conspiracy, armed robbery, \nand murder was denied the use of polygraph results that he asserted would clear his \nparticipation in the robbery. The Court clearly summarized the law regarding polygraph \nevidence in that District, noting that the Eighth Amendment guarantee to a capital \ndefendant to present relevant mitigating information is not without its limits. Despite \nstatutorily relaxed rules of evidence in capital sentencing proceedings7 similar to \nregulations governing DOHA hearings, the Court stated that the \u201ctrial judge retains his \ntraditional role as gatekeeper\u201d and \u201cmust accordingly exclude any unreliable or prejudicial \ninformation that might render a trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d The Court also noted that \n\u201c[p]olygraphs remain nearly universally frowned upon as courtroom lie detectors,\u201d and \ninstead relied on the jury as the \u201clie detector,\u201d and reiterated that \u201cthere is simply no way \nto know in a particular case whether a polygraph examiner\u2019s conclusion is accurate \nbecause certain doubts and uncertainties plague even the best polygraph exams.\u201d \nCatalan Roman 368 F. Supp. at 122, citing Scheffer 532 U.S. 303 at 312. The Court held \n7  18 U.S.C. 3593 (c) (Information is admissible regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing \nadmission of evidence at criminal trials except that information may be excluded if its probative value is \noutweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \nthat \u201c[p]olygraph results are inherently unreliable and this alone warrants their exclusion.\u201d \nCatalan Roman, 368 F. Supp. 2d at 124. \nAlthough DOHA cases do not normally implicate such life or death consequences, \nand juries are not a part of our proceedings, such cases as those noted above reflect the \nFederal Courts\u2019 willingness to exclude favorable exculpatory polygraph evidence despite \nthe degree of personal peril faced by defendants. \nIn this case, Department Counsel\u2019s main objection relates to the section of \nApplicant\u2019s polygraph report labeled \u201cevaluation phase.\u201d I note that the exhibit does not \ncontain technical charts or raw data; the report is silent on the use of control questions \n(although the report claims to have used \u201cFederally authorized testing format and \nquestions\u201d); no audio or video recording of the interview and polygraph examination was \ndisclosed; there is no listing of documents provided to the examiner or reviewed before \nthe exam; and there was no evidence submitted that the technical data was reviewed by \na quality control supervisor and a final opinion rendered, similar to that required for \nGovernment polygraph exams. See DOD Instruction 5210.91, March 30, 2020, at pp. 19-\n21. Inclusion of this information in the proposed exhibit would have provided the \nGovernment an opportunity to fully examine the information and obtain an expert\u2019s \nanalysis, and avoid excessive time and resources that would be needed to decide its \nadmissibility and reliability. \nIn addition, private polygraph examinations are generally a product prepared by, \nsold to, and paid for by individuals and their counsel. The private examiner is in the \nbusiness of profiting from the exam and presumably anticipates future sales. Therefore, \nthe private examiner\u2019s motivations may render the exams\u2019 results inherently, if unwittingly, \nbiased in favor of the paying client. Of note, no evidence regarding bias or lack thereof \nwas presented in this case. It should be noted when discussing private polygraph exams \nin general, results that go against the defendant or applicant\u2019s interests never \u201csee the \nlight of day\u201d in a courtroom or DOHA hearing, so the Judge may never know how many \nprivate polygraph exams were \u201cfailed\u201d before considering the favorable exam submitted.8 \nThe extent to which Government-obtained polygraph evidence is used in security \neligibility determinations must be considered. Polygraph technical analysis alone is not \ngenerally acceptable as definitive evidence of truthfulness or untruthfulness. Government \nclearance decisions comprising statements of fact an applicant made during pre- or post-\ntest interviews connected with polygraph examinations are generally admissible as \nsubstantive evidence in DOHA hearings. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18324 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 11, 2011). The Government may not take adverse action solely on the basis of \npolygraph examination technical calls in the absence of adjudicatively significant \ninformation.\u201d SEAD 4: National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), \nAppendix A, \u00b6 1(c). \n8  There is no evidence in the record, nor do I have reason to suspect, that Applicant took more than one \npolygraph examination or that he \u201cfailed\u201d any previous polygraph exams. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has noted that: \nThe oral or written statements made by the subject of a polygraph \nexamination are not the same as the polygraph charts, or the polygrapher's \nopinion whether the subject's statements are truthful or deceptive. The \nreliability or unreliability of the polygraph machine, a polygrapher's \ninterpretation of a polygraph chart, or a polygrapher's opinion as to the \nveracity of a person undergoing a polygraph examination are factually and \nlegally distinct from the statements a person may make during or after a \npolygraph examination. See also ISCR Case No. 94-1057 (August 11, \n1995) at p. 6 (citing Wyrick v. Fields, 459 U.S. 42, 48 n.* (1982) and noting \nthe difference between a polygraph examination chart and an applicant's \npost-polygraph statements). \nISCR Case No. 02-31428 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2006) at p.4. See also ISCR Case No. 11-\n03452 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2012) (involving analysis of evidence that Applicant used \npolygraph countermeasures). \nLikewise, conclusory opinions of private polygraph examiners, based on technical \nanalysis alone, should be viewed with skepticism as to the accuracy of the polygraph \nexamination and analysis of data and interpretation of physiological reactions, and should \nnot be accepted as determinative of the matter examined. However, testimony in the form \nof an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable even if it embraces \nan ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact. ISCR Case No. 96-0785 (App. Bd. \nSep. 3, 1998) \nI find that the polygraph examination report (AE C) is minimally complete, and the \nprobative value of the \u201cevaluation phase\u201d of the report was not outweighed by the amount \nof time and resources that would be needed to decide its admissibility. The addition of the \ndeficient items as part of the report would have aided in evaluating the credibility, \nreliability, and accuracy of the examiner\u2019s analysis and conclusions, but the possibility of \ninherent bias of the private polygraph examiner must also be considered. Although the \nreport was admitted on its face, the administrative judge must determine the appropriate \nweight to be applied. The Appeal Board noted: \nIt is not unusual for a Judge to be faced with the need to consider and weigh \nconflicting record evidence. A Judge faced with conflicting record evidence \nmust decide how much weight to give to the conflicting pieces of record \nevidence and make findings of fact that reflect a reasonable interpretation \nof the record evidence as a whole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-09892 (July \n15, 2004) at p. 5. A Judge must \u2013 of practical necessity \u2013 weigh the record \nevidence, decide what evidence is credible and persuasive, and make \nfindings of fact concerning controverted factual issues.

First, the qualification of the \u201cexpert\u201d consultant (assessor) \nis not fully developed. Although the expert was \u201cretained\u201d by Applicant\u2019s counsel to \nprepare a counterintelligence assessment, it is unclear whether the assessor is still a \nFederal employee or in the business of preparing assessments for profit. Next, the report \ndoes not fully develop the expert\u2019s qualifications, including specific education and training, \nand the length and specificity of experience. Rather, the totality of the expert\u2019s \nqualifications in counterintelligence was summarized in two sentences after he noted that \nhe was a Naval Academy graduate and former U.S. Marine Corps officer. The paucity of \nthe consultant\u2019s education and background information appears to assume that a college \ndegree and some military and FBI experience is sufficient to qualify him as a \ncounterintelligence expert, and thus, gives his opinion appropriate gravitas. \nThe expert reviewed documents that were eventually admitted into evidence at the \nhearing, presumably including the polygraph examiner\u2019s data analysis, opinions, and \nconclusion as noted above. The expert interviewed Applicant via a video teleconference; \nhowever, he did not provide a transcript or summary of the interview despite claiming it \nto be a factor he used to develop the basis for his assessment. The expert concludes that \nApplicant \u201cdoes not pose a security risk\u201d and that Applicant \u201cdemonstrates characteristics \nof an individual who is trustworthy, and who is able to maintain classified information \nwithout significant risk of compromise by bad actors or foreign intelligence agents.\u201d The \nbasis for this conclusion is not adequately addressed in the report, despite the expert\u2019s \nreliance on his \u201c21 years of experience working insider threat and espionage \ninvestigations.\u201d \nAdditionally, the expert did not mention the consideration or weight applied to the \nbehavior that formed the basis of the SOR in the formation of his opinion of Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness and potential for compromise. Notably, no mention was made in the report \nregarding the inherent risks Applicant willingly took to introduce a personal hard drive \ncontaining pornography into a company laptop that would be connected to company \ninformation system, as an avenue to place malicious computer code into a computer \nsystem or network. However, the expert appears to give great weight to Applicant\u2019s past \ninvolvement with classified and special access (SAP) programs as a defense contractor. \nHe reasoned that since Applicant\u2019s knowledge of classified information is \u201cfront \nloaded\u201d when he first obtained a clearance or was \u201cread into\u201d a program, the \u201cmost \nsignificant risk to national security has already taken place.\u201d The expert inexplicably noted \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat with Applicant\u2019s continued access to classified information and his current SAP \nprogram, there is not \u201cmuch added risk to national security.\u201d This is not the evaluative \nprocess mandated by the Directive. \nFinally, the expert concluded his assessment by again stating that it is based on \nhis \u201cknowledge, experience, and training,\u201d and is \u201cno guarantee of future behavior or \nfuture security of information.\u201d Given the skeletal nature of the report, it is difficult to find \nvalue in or rely on its conclusions. \nAlthough I admitted the counterintelligence assessment into evidence and fully \nconsidered its content, I find it to have little to no persuasive value as it does not \nmeaningfully or persuasively contribute to a determination of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \njudgment, or security worthiness. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior program manager for a defense contractor, \nemployed since August 2017. He previously worked as a senior staff project engineer for \nanother defense contractor from 2001 until he was suspended and resigned in June 2017. \nHe received two bachelor\u2019s degrees in 1998 and 2000, a master\u2019s degree in 2004, and a \ndoctorate degree in 2013. He married in 2000 and has four children, ages 10 through 17. \nHe testified that he has held DOD security clearances and special access program (SAP) \nprivileges for over 19 years. He reported that his top-secret clearance was granted in \nabout 2003. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology) that \nApplicant resigned in June 2017 in lieu of termination after his employer discovered that \nhe misused a company computer to view pornography or adult-oriented material, and he \nviolated security protocols by using a personal external storage device on a company \ncomputer. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) that: (a) Applicant falsified \nhis September 2017 SCA by answering \u201cno\u201d to a question in Section 13C - Employment \nRecord, asking if he was fired from a job; quit after being told he would be fired; left a job \nby mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct; left a job by mutual \nagreement after notice of unsatisfactory performance; received a written warning, been \nofficially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such \nas a violation of security policy; and (b) Applicant falsified his September 2017 SCA by \nanswering \u201cno\u201d to a question in Section 27 \u2013 Use of Information Technology Systems, \nasking if he introduced, removed, or used hardware, software, or media in connection \nwith any information technology system without authorization, when specifically \nprohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations, or attempted any of the above. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used his work-issued laptop \nto view sexually-explicit videos at his home with his wife. He claimed that on five to ten \noccasions, he inserted a removable drive that contained sexually-explicit videos into a \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUSB port on his company laptop to view with his wife. He denied that he resigned from \nhis job in lieu of termination; rather he averred that although he knew his actions could \nresult in \u201cfuture disciplinary action,\u201d he resigned because he was embarrassed and his \nreputation was tarnished at his workplace. (Ans.) \nApplicant also denied falsifying his SCA, claiming he did not resign under an \n\u201cexplicit or promise of future discipline\u201d or for any other reason posed in the question 13C \non his SCA, and that an answer of \u201cno\u201d continues to be the correct answer. He also stated \nthat although his initial answer to SCA question 27 was \u201cfactually incorrect,\u201d he did not \ndeliberately falsify his answer. He explained that he corrected his answer to question 27 \nafter reviewing it with the investigator during his personal subject interview (PSI), and that \nhe was \u201copen and candid with the investigator about his reasons for leaving\u201d his \nemployment. (Ans.) In fact, the PSI shows that Applicant was twice asked about his \nresponse to SCA question 13C regarding his suspension from employment, not question \n27 regarding his use of information technology (IT) systems, where he changed his SCA \nanswer and admitted the violation. (GE 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s work for his previous employer, a defense contractor, spanned 16 \nyears and required security eligibility at the top-secret level, with special access program \nprivileges. He was a first-line manager and supervised other cleared employees. He was \ntrained on information security measures while employed with the company, and attended \nrequired security briefings. He worked within a DOD-designated \u201cclosed area\u201d where \nphones, personal computers, and other personal devices were prohibited, however \ncompany-issued laptops were allowed into the area and were connected to company IT \nsystems while there. Before the incidents in question, Applicant had no prior security \ninfractions. \nApplicant used his work-issued computer to view pornography installed via a \npersonal USB device (external hard drive). He testified that he used the USB device and \ncompany computer to view pornography for four to six months, including with his spouse \nand while on travel alone. He did not correct the length of time he used the device when \nspeaking to the government investigator, nor did he correct it on his PSI when he certified \nits accuracy in response to Government interrogatories. \nWhen the USB device was inserted into the computer, a warning banner appeared \non the screen that warned about moving information to or from the computer. Applicant \nadmitted in his PSI that he knew of the policy prohibiting employees from inserting \nexternal non-employment-approved hardware into work devices (GE 2.), but later testified \nthat the use of a personal USB device plugged into the computer was a \u201cgrey area.\u201d (Tr. \n38) Applicant justified his actions by claiming that he was not logged into a company \nnetwork, he was not on duty, and the computer was not used for classified work. He \ntestified that he knew viewing pornography on his company computer was a violation of \ncompany policy. (Tr. 38; AE L.) \nUnbeknown to Applicant, his company computer was being monitored by his \nemployer, who discovered the improper activity and conducted an investigation. (GE 2; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGE 4.) The company\u2019s investigation revealed that pornography was present on \nApplicant\u2019s USB drive and that using a company computer to view such material was \nprohibited. (GE 4.) The investigator explained to Applicant that pornography was a \n\u201ccommonly recognized threat vector\u201d and a method for \u201cplacing malicious computer code \ninto a computer system or network.\u201d (GE 4.) Applicant confirmed that he also used the \nUSB device while on a recent business trip, and admitted that he used \u201cabsolutely \nincredibly poor judgment in using the device.\u201d (GE 4.) \nApplicant also used the work computer to access an online website to view online \npersonal ads while on travel, and used \u201cemail to look for a meeting with other men.\u201d (GE \n4.) Applicant told the investigator that he was only \u201cplaying a game,\u201d and that no meeting \noccurred on his last trip, but admitted that he previously met with people on two other \noccasions but never discussed his work and had no continuing contact with either person. \n(GE 4.) The company investigator explained to Applicant that \u201cengaging in such activity \ncould place him at great risk physically and professionally by someone he met by \nattempting to harm or compromise him in some manner.\u201d (GE 4.) Applicant\u2019s use of the \ncompany computer to arrange personal liaisons was not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant carried his personal USB device into the closed work area in his \nbriefcase, in violation of company policy. (GE 4; AE L.) The company labeled this a \nsecurity violation. (AE L.) Contrary to his testimony, he admitted to the company \ninvestigator that he knew using the USB device in his company computer was prohibited, \nbut he claimed he was \u201cnot sure\u201d whether the device could be carried into the closed work \narea. (GE 4.) In testimony, he stated that he did not know he was prohibited from taking \nthe device into the closed area, but he \u201cshould have known.\u201d (Tr. 34-37.) Introducing a \nprohibited device into the closed work area was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn a subsequent statement addressed to the company disciplinary review board \n(DRB), Applicant stated that he \u201cexercised some very poor judgment in [his] personal life \nand does not dispute any of the facts as presented to [him] by the investigators.\u201d (GE 4 \u2013 \nStatement.) He pleaded with the DRB that he would accept any disciplinary action \nmandated if they allowed him to continue employment, but if that was not possible, he \nrequested that the DRB allow him to resign or impose a form of termination that might \nallow him a clean start in another industry. (GE 4 \u2013 Statement.) \nApplicant was stripped of his access badge and was placed on indefinite \ndisciplinary suspension pending a formal disposition of the DRB. (GE 4; AE L.) The \ncompany reported Applicant\u2019s conduct to DOD via a JPAS incident history report, and \nnoted that Applicant resigned via email on June 22, 2017, the day before the DRB. The \ncompany noted that Applicant\u2019s resignation was \u201cin lieu of termination,\u201d and he was not \neligible for rehire. (GE 3; AE L.) Applicant was aware that the DRB could result in \ndisciplinary action or termination of employment, and testified that he was concerned \nabout his reputation in the company and believed a \u201cnegative\u201d DRB outcome would limit \nhis ability to retain a security clearance. (Tr. 21-26.) In testimony, he quibbled regarding \nthe labeling of his suspension, calling it \u201cadministrative leave,\u201d not a suspension, because \nhe was not formally notified of a suspension and was paid.

He did not initially reveal his \nsuspension and full involvement in the misuse of the company computer. He was twice \nasked if he had received a written reprimand, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or \ndisciplined for misconduct in the workplace such as a violation of security policy, and he \ntwice answered \u201cno.\u201d When confronted with his suspension from his previous employer, \nhe hesitated before admitting that he was suspended for inserting personal hardware into \nhis work computer to view pornography. (GE 2.) \nWhen asked by the investigator whether he introduced, removed or used \nhardware, software, or media in connection with any information technology system \nwithout authorization when specifically prohibited, he stated \u201cyes.\u201d He claimed he \nmisunderstood the related question on his SCA when he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27, \nbut did not elaborate on what he misunderstood. (GE 2.) In testimony, Applicant claimed \nthat he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27 because he believed the question was limited to \nclassified systems, despite that it specifically referred to \u201cany information technology \nsystem.\u201d (Tr. 27-29.) He testified that he finally understood that his answer on the SCA \nwas incorrect after the investigator repeated the question with an emphasis on \u201cany\u201d \nsystem. I note that the PSI does not indicate that Applicant was coached by the \ninvestigator or that the investigator had to emphasize any particular part of SCA question \n27, rather the investigator noted that she twice asked Applicant to disclose his \nemployment record in response to SCA question 13C, before he acknowledged his \nsuspension. \nApplicant explained to the Government investigator that he used the USB and \ncomputer to view pornography with his wife in their bedroom, but he did not disclose that \nhe also used it while alone on a business trip, or that he searched personal ads, used \nemail to arrange liasons while traveling, or that he introduced the prohibited USB device \ninto a closed work area in violation of security regulations and company policy. (GE 2.) \nHe acknowledged in his interview that he was aware that inserting his personal USB into \nthe computer to view pornography was prohibited, and claimed, contrary to his hearing \ntestimony, that he did so \u201cmany times in a month to two months timeframe.\u201d (GE 2.) \nApplicant acknowledged that his misuse of the computer violated company policy and \ntook full responsibility for his actions. He claimed he had a \u201cterrible lapse of judgment\u201d \nand became \u201cimpulsive.\u201d He explained that he did not disclose his conduct on his SCA \nbecause he interpreted the question (SCA question 27) as strictly related to violating \n\u201csecurity policies.\u201d (GE 2.) \nApplicant disputes that he was \u201csuspended\u201d and resigned in lieu of termination or \nby mutual agreement. Applicant testified that he was not formally suspended, rather he \nwas simply on paid administrative leave. He also testified that he did not resign by mutual \nagreement or in lieu of termination because he resigned the day before the DRB was \nscheduled to meet, and he was not told he would be fired. However, in his PSI, he \nadmitted that he was \u201csuspended with pay for a week.\u201d (GE 2.) He further explained in \nhis PSI that he \u201cwas told that he was being suspended for [a] week pending the \ndisciplinary board\u2019s decision.

Applicant answered that he \u201cresigned to take position at \n[another defense contractor].\u201d (GE 1. p.14.) In addition, when asked if he left employment \nby \u201cmutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct\u201d or \u201cfollowing notice \nof unsatisfactory performance,\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d (GE 1. p.14.) However, \nApplicant did not have a new position with his current employer at the time he resigned. \n(Tr. 48.) He testified that after resigning, he contacted a program director with another \ngovernment contractor whom Applicant met while conducting business with his previous \nemployer. According to the program director that conducted the interview, Applicant \ndisclosed that he made a \u201cpersonal mistake and had inappropriately used an unclassified \n[company]-owned laptop computer. As a result of that incident, he was personally \nembarrassed and felt that the incident would have lasting negative impact on his ability \nfor career advancement\u201d with the company. (AE E.) The new employer concluded that \nApplicant had a \u201csignificant lapse in judgment and that it violated [his company\u2019s] policy, \nit was not a security infraction.\u201d Applicant was hired in the summer of 2017, and is \ncurrently employed in substantially the same classified work he performed with his \nprevious employer. The evidence is unclear as to what, if any, other information was \nprovided to the new employer regarding Applicant\u2019s previous employment conduct, and \non what basis it determined that Applicant\u2019s actions did not qualify as a \u201csecurity \ninfraction.\u201d \nIn his PSI, Applicant acknowledged his lack of judgment when using the company \ncomputer, and attributed it his \u201cignorance and careless actions.\u201d (GE 2.) He took \naccountability for his \u201cmistake\u201d and learned a lifelong lesson. He avers that he hopes to \nput the incident behind him, but asserts that use of the USB device in the computer \u201cdid \nnot put the company\u2019s security at risk and no data or PII was lost. (GE 2.) Of note, \nApplicant continued to under report the extent of his use of the USB and company laptop \nwhen he completed an \u201cAffidavit of [Applicant]\u201d in April 2020. In the affidavit, he admitted \nto violating company rules by viewing the pornography with his wife, but failed to disclose \nhis use while on travel. (AE J.) He also continues to deny that he has breached any \nsecurity protocols by stating \u201cfor all of my 19 year career, I have not had single [sic] \ninfraction or incident involving any security issues.\u201d \nIn a review by Applicant\u2019s former employer, they noted in a letter dated June 11, \n2020 that: \nWhen [the company] representatives interviewed [Applicant], he admitted \nto viewing the materials using his [company] asset and understanding that \nsuch actions were prohibited.

The employer notes that they do not have another leader of \nApplicant\u2019s caliber waiting in the wings to replace him. (AE E.) \nLikewise, Applicant\u2019s former coworkers expressed their strong support for him and \ndiscussed the harm that would occur to his new employer and the Government if Applicant \ndoes not retain his security clearance and continue work on important, highly-classified \nprojects. (AE F, G.) Applicant\u2019s spouse also supports him and acknowledged that their \nuse of the company computer to view pornography together was an \u201cegregious error.\u201d \n(AE H.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology Systems \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nRelevant conditions that could raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 40 and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(e) unauthorized entry any information technology system; and \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nThe evidence presented is sufficient to raise the security concerns described \nabove. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from incidents regarding \nuse of information technology are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt, \ngood-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to appropriate \npersonnel. \nNone of the mitigation conditions fully apply. While the conduct in question that led \nto Applicant\u2019s resignation to avoid discipline or termination was discovered by the \ncompany in 2017, and had occurred numerous times up to six months prior to discovery, \nthe conduct was knowing and intentional, and there is insufficient evidence that Applicant \nhas taken full responsibility or that sufficient time has elapsed to show that it is unlikely to \nrecur. \nThe conduct discussed in the findings of fact clearly display an ongoing pattern of \nintentional security and company policy violations and misuse of company resources that \ncould jeopardize a government contractor\u2019s IT systems. Applicant attempted to evade \nculpability by resigning before the DRB could conclude its deliberations with the hope of \navoiding discipline, termination, or the loss of security eligibility. He also falsified his SCA \nand was reluctant to disclose his actions to a government investigator without prodding. \nFinally, he provided incomplete and inconsistent explanations during the clearance \nprocess. His actions continue to cast doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness, and call \ninto question his willingness to protect sensitive systems and networks. \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDespite computer banner warnings displayed every time he wrongfully used the \nUSB device, Applicant continued the computer activity for up to six months. He initially \nclaimed he used the computer in this manner for one-to-two months, but he admitted at \nthe hearing that it was actually four-to-six months. He did not correct the misinformation \nor incomplete information provided to the government investigator, nor did he correct the \nPSI when provided with the opportunity in response to interrogatories. Rather he certified \nthe accuracy of the PSI. Applicant\u2019s willful misuse of the computer and USB device \noccurred while alone on business travel as well as with his spouse, a fact not disclosed \nto the government investigator. Applicant was disinclined to disclose his computer \nmisconduct and suspension to the investigator without being confronted and prodded. He \nwillfully failed to disclose his conduct and suspension in his SCA, and was evasive in \nreporting the reason for leaving employment. These behaviors display a reluctance to \nfully disclose and take responsibility for his actions, and an ongoing effort to minimize or \ndivert his culpability. \nAdditionally, Applicant did not disclose information to the government investigator, \nregarding taking an unauthorized device into the closed workspace or misusing the \ncompany\u2019s computer and email to arrange personal liaisons while traveling. Although this \nconduct was not alleged in the SOR, it is appropriate to consider it: \n(a) to assess his credibility; (b) to evaluate his evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether he has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide \nevidence for whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006).  \nA pattern of IT security violations and Applicant\u2019s willingness to engage in \npotentially compromising behavior refutes Applicant\u2019s claim of a regrettable transgression \nand plea for forgiveness and reform. \nApplicant is a highly-educated and experienced supervisor, with a long history of \nwork with IT assets in classified and sensitive environments. He acted in full knowledge \nof the risks and willfully ignored security training and computer banner warnings for \npersonal pleasure. Depending on the forum, Applicant is quibbling and vague about the \ndetails of his actions and his knowledge of company rules and policies. He continues to \nshow an unwillingness to grasp the gravity of his actions by claiming that he did not put \nthe company\u2019s security at risk, despite the explanations and warnings given to him by the \ncompany investigator. No mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline E; Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nThe personal conduct alleged is generally sufficient to implicate AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (a) and (b). \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from incidents of personal \nconduct are provided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Applicant engaged \nin a pattern of knowing and intentional deception when he failed to disclose in response \nto SCA section 13C - Employment Record, his suspension for misconduct including \nviolations of company security policies, and his resignation by mutual agreement after \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing notified of misconduct in the workplace such as a violation of security policies, or in \nlieu of termination, as labeled by his company. No matter how Applicant would like to \nmince words and obfuscate the reality of his employment situation, it is clear that he \nresigned in order to avoid serious disciplinary action including termination, and a critical \nfinding by the DRB that would jeopardize his security clearance. \nIn addition, Applicant failed to disclose in response to SCA section 27 - Use of \nInformation Technology Systems that he misused his company computer by inserting a \nprohibited USB device to view pornography, in violation of company rules, policies and \nprocedures. \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant (1) intentionally failed to disclose the \nreason for leaving his last employment in response to SCA section 13A; (2) failed to \ndisclose to a government investigator that he introduced a prohibited device into the \nclosed workspace, a security violation; (3) used a company computer and email to view \nonline personal ads and arrange for personal liaisons while traveling, a behavior that put \nhim at personal and professional risk of harm or compromise; and (4) deliberately failed \nto voluntarily disclose his suspension during his PSI without being confronted or prodded. \nIt is appropriate to consider this information to assess his credibility; to evaluate his \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether he \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was serious, recent, and recurring. He was reluctant to correct \nthe record without being confronted and prodded. He has not convincingly shown an \nunderstanding of the security ramifications of his conduct, or sincere remorse. Rather, he \nhas displayed more concern for himself and the impact on his career and clearance \neligibility. He failed to fully cooperate with government investigators and straightforwardly \ndisclose the extent and details of his conduct. Rather, he has shown a propensity to \nminimize, equivocate, and obfuscate his conduct. \nI am not convinced that Applicant\u2019s display of poor judgment, intentional \nfalsifications, and lack of candor is behind him, or that similar conduct will not recur. After \ndiscovery of his conduct by his company, he attempted to avoid a detrimental DRB \ndetermination, then displayed a lack of honesty and candor by not providing full, frank \nand truthful answers during the security investigation process. Given the circumstances \ndetailed above, I find that no mitigating condition fully applies and that Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior overall warrants an unfavorable clearance action. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n_______________________ \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines M and E, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s long history of employment and security eligibility, his current employment \ncircumstances, the importance of his skills and knowledge to his employer and the \nGovernment client, and the strong support from his family and coworkers. \nApplicant was expected to conduct himself in a manner consistent with an \nexperienced and knowledgeable senior defense contractor employee, and comply with IT \nsecurity protocols and respect the security investigation process. However, his pattern of \nmisconduct, lack of candor, and self-serving behavior does not overcome presumptions \nof mistake, ignorance, or an isolated event that may be due a person with an otherwise \nexcellent employment record. I remain concerned about Applicant\u2019s continued \ntrustworthiness to protect national security information and ability to comply with rules and \nregulations. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.

He admits that he has not filed his outstanding tax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and that he filed his other returns late (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant disclosed the derogatory tax information on his e-QIP and discussed it during his personal subject interview (PSI) and in his responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories. (GX 3; GX 4.) His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant, 49, is an audio-visual technician working for a defense contractor since June 2013. He graduated from high school in 1989. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in February 1992, but received a general discharge under honorable conditions in May 1992 for pre-existing medical condition. He has never been married and has an adult daughter. This is his first application for a security clearance. (GX 3.) There is no personal income tax in the state where Applicant lives.

The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days \nafter receiving it to submit information. He did not file a response. The DOHA transmittal \nletter and receipt are appended to the record as Administrative Exhibit (Admin. Ex.) 1. \nThe case was assigned to me on March 18, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for a $5,735 Federal \ntax lien for tax year 2007 entered in 2010; failed to timely file his Federal tax returns for \ntax years 2007 and 2010 through 2012 and those returns remain unfiled; and failed to \ntimely file his Federal tax returns for 2009 and 2015 through 2017. Applicant denies the \ntax lien stating that the IRS withheld subsequent refunds to satisfy the lien (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nHe admits that he has not filed his outstanding tax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and that he filed \nhis other returns late (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant disclosed the derogatory tax information on \nhis e-QIP and discussed it during his personal subject interview (PSI) and in his \nresponses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories. (GX 3; GX 4.) His admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. \nApplicant, 49, is an audio-visual technician working for a defense contractor since \nJune 2013. He graduated from high school in 1989. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in \nFebruary 1992, but received a general discharge under honorable conditions in May 1992 \nfor pre-existing medical condition. He has never been married and has an adult daughter. \nThis is his first application for a security clearance. (GX 3.) \nThere is no personal income tax in the state where Applicant lives. In his PSI, \nApplicant stated that he did not file or pay his Federal income tax for 2007, which resulted \nin the $5,735 lien that was entered in 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), because he did not have the \nmoney to do so. In his Answer, he stated his 2013 through 2016 and a portion of his 2017 \ntax refunds were used to satisfy the lien. He provided documentation from the IRS \nshowing that he received an $869 refund for 2017. \nApplicant began experiencing overall financial difficulties after losing his job in \n2009. He owned and operated his own business between April 2009 and June 2013 and \ndid not have the money to pay his taxes. He fell behind on his mortgage-loan payments \nand his home was ultimately sold in a foreclosure sale. The lender cancelled the loan-\nbalance debt and issued Applicant an IRS Form 1099-C Cancellation of Debt in the \namount of $26,156 in 2012. Applicant was required to claim this amount as income on his \n2012 tax return. (GX 3.) \nOn his May 2016 e-QIP, Applicant stated that he had contacted the IRS to set up \na payment plan for the then still outstanding lien balance. In order to enter a repayment \nplan, the IRS required Applicant to file his 2010 through 2012 returns and gave him until \nJune 3, 2016, to file. He did not meet the deadline. During his August 2016 PSI, Applicant \nstated that he was trying to obtain the necessary documents to file his delinquent returns. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his May 2020 Answer, he stated that he had gathered the necessary documents and \nwas preparing the returns to mail to the IRS as soon as possible. The record does not \ncontain any evidence that Applicant has filed his 2010 through 2012 tax returns. \nApplicant admits that he did not timely file his 2009 and 2015 through 2017 tax \nreturns (SOR \u00b6 1.c), stating that he mistakenly believed he was only required to file by \nthe April 15th  deadline if he owed money. He also stated that he now timely files his tax \nreturns. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status is stable. He is current on his ongoing financial \nobligations including his mortgage loan, automobile loan, and a credit-card account. His \nrecent CBR shows numerous \u201cpaid and closed\u201d accounts. (GX 5; GX 6.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal . . . income tax returns or failure \nto pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant began experiencing overall financial difficulties following the loss of his \njob in 2009 and during the subsequent almost four-year period of self-employment. He \nlost his home to foreclosure and did not have the money to pay his taxes for 2011 through \n2013. While these circumstances were largely beyond his control, Applicant did not act \nresponsibly. He did not fulfill the requirements necessary to obtain a repayment plan with \nthe IRS. Nor has he filed the 2011 through 2013 income tax returns despite his claims \nthat they are completed. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent, ongoing, and unresolved. \nHe did not make a good-faith effort to resolve the 2010 tax lien, which was satisfied by \nthe IRS\u2019s retaining Applicant\u2019s refunds for several years. Despite his awareness of the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns about his unfiled tax returns since at least his 2016 PSI, he has \nnot taken the necessary steps to bring himself into good standing with the IRS. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay his Federal taxes while aware that the \nGovernment was concerned about this conduct since at least 2016 raises concerns about \nhis willingness to abide by rules and regulations, and about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole\u00ad\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). \nI have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) and incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure \nto comply with Federal tax filing and payment requirements. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The police examiners concluded that it was inappropriate for \nApplicant\u2019s wife to be in the room while the examination was conducted, the questions \nwere not sufficiently specific, the terminology (\u201csexual contact\u201d) was too broad, and three \nrelevant questions were asked during the examination instead of the accepted practice \nof asking only one relevant question.

In October 2016, Applicant\u2019s wife filed \nfor divorce, on the ground that Applicant had been guilty of gross neglect of duty and \nextreme cruelty and that the parties were incompatible. (AX E at 1.) \nIn November 2016, Applicant\u2019s wife sought temporary custody of their children and \nasked that Applicant\u2019s parenting time with the children be supervised.

He believed that his wife \nconcluded from this event that he had a sexual disorder. (GX D(3) at 4.) \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant \u201chad no apparent and diagnosable \ndisorder, but showed symptoms of dependent personality traits, with obsessive-\ncompulsive and avoidant features\u201d; that he \u201cpresented a personal history and mental \nhealth profile that made [his wife\u2019s] allegations against him at least circumstantially and \nsituationally feasible\u201d; and that he displayed a more passive, laissez faire interaction \npattern with the children, as well as engaged in frequent age-inappropriate coddling, \ncuddling, and infantilizing interchanges with them.\u201d \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s wife \u201cshowed symptoms of a \nsituational and transient adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression, as well as \nevidence of obsessive-compulsive personality traits, with narcissistic (manifested as low \nself-esteem) and histrionic (i.e., overly dramatic and emotional tendencies features\u201d; that \n\u201cthere was no definitive psychological data clearly suggestive or confirmatory of [her] \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBefore the charges were presented to a grand jury, Applicant received a letter from \nthe county children\u2019s services office, recommending that he have no contact with his \nchildren until he completed a sex-offender assessment.

The psychologist also \nrecommended that Applicant\u2014 \n[S]ubmit to and participate in mental health counseling or therapy to more \ndefinitively rule out the likelihood of his impropriety toward the children, as \nwell as to work toward the normalization and re-unification of his parental \nrelationship with them, to minimize any cloud of ongoing suspicion, and to \npreclude the likelihood of ongoing legal charges and counter-charges. \n(AX D(3) at 26.) \nOn November 10, 2016, Applicant\u2019s wife enrolled the two children in a counseling \nprogram and informed a counselor that she had observed Applicant in bed with their son \nwith their son\u2019s hands in Applicant\u2019s pants. In January 2017, while the children were in \nplay therapy, their son drew pictures of trees that appeared to have penises, and their \ndaughter drew picture of a rainbow with the family inside and her on the outside. In \nFebruary 2017, Applicant\u2019s wife told the counselor that the children previously had \nepisodes of bed-wetting and had reverted to it.

The county \nchildren\u2019s services office arranged for a forensic interview, which occurred on July 26, \n2018.

His son also said that Applicant inserted a finger into his anus \nand moved it around. (GX 5 at 11.) \nIn July 2018, Applicant was sentenced for the public indecency to which he had \npleaded guilty. He was sentenced to incarceration for 60 days, to be served on weekends, \nand supervised probation for five years. He was prohibited from having any contact with \nhis children for five years. (GX 4 at 15.) \nIn August 2018, Applicant was charged with rape, a felony of the first degree, and \ngross sexual imposition, a felony of the third degree.

(GX 3 at 5-6.) \nIn October 2018, Applicant\u2019s wife was persuaded by a police officer to ask \nApplicant to take a second polygraph examination. It would be a stipulated examination, \nwith an agreement that the charges would be dismissed if he passed the examination and \nthat he would agree to admissibility of the exam results if he failed. After consulting with \nhis attorney, Applicant declined to take a stipulated polygraph examination. His attorney \nadvised against a second polygraph because he already had favorable results from the \nfirst examination and it would be inadvisable to risk an unfavorable result from a second \nexamination. \nIn April 2019, the prosecutor concluded that there was insufficient evidence to \nprove the offenses involving Applicant\u2019s son beyond a reasonable doubt. (GX 5 at 15-16.) \nThe charges were dismissed without prejudice. (GX 4 at 26.) \nApplicant and his wife were divorced in May 2018, and his ex-wife remarried in \nMay 2019.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Polygraph examinations are \nwidely used within the Government and serve a useful function when combined with other \ninformation to form an opinion as to the credibility of an applicant. However, in security \neligibility cases, they are not a substitute for the evaluation and judgment of the \nadministrative judge in light of the totality of the evidence. \nThere is no per se rule against the introduction of private polygraph examination \nresults by applicants in DOHA hearings. However, when polygraph evidence is tendered \nby an applicant, an administrative judge is required to consider whether the applicant has \ndemonstrated its accuracy, reliability, and fairness. ISCR Case No. 96-0785 (App. Bd. \nSep. 3, 1998). \nPrivate polygraph examinations are generally a product prepared by, sold to, and \npaid for by individuals and their counsel. The private examiner is in the business of \nprofiting from the exam and presumably anticipates future sales. Therefore, the private \nexaminer\u2019s motivations may render the exam\u2019s results inherently, if unwittingly, biased in \nfavor of the paying client. In this case, Applicant\u2019s wife hired the polygraph examiner, and \nApplicant agreed to the examination in response to an ultimatum from his wife. However, \nthe results were not consistent with his wife\u2019s suspicions. \nThe record contains no evidence of the qualifications or experience of the private \npolygraph examiner. Two certified police polygraph examiners concluded that the results \nof the polygraph examiner were invalid because of Applicant\u2019s wife was in the room while \nthe polygraph examination was conducted and the terminology and arrangement of the \nquestions was defective. However, Department Counsel did not object to the polygraph \nevidence, thereby waiving any objection. Notwithstanding the lack of objection by \nDepartment Counsel, I have given the results of the polygraph examination limited weight \nbecause of the circumstances under which it was conducted, the possible bias of a private \nexaminer, and the deficiencies pointed out by the police polygraph experts. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted that he was convicted of public \nindecency (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he was charged with felony rape and felony gross sex \nimposition (SOR \u00b6 1.b), but he contended during the hearing that he was innocent of both \ncharges. \nApplicant was represented by an attorney at his trial, and he pleaded guilty to the \noffense alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Although his guilty plea was a product of a plea agreement, \nit is sufficient to establish SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence concerning SOR \u00b6 1.b is convoluted and conflicting, but Applicant \nnever went to trial on this allegation, because the charge was dismissed as part of a plea \nagreement. However, the forensic interviews of Applicant\u2019s son in July 2018 provided \nsubstantial evidence of the offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the evidence submitted at the hearing, and Applicant\u2019s \nplea of guilty to public indecency are sufficient to establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \nAG \u00b6 13(b): pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior . . . that reflects lack of discretion or judgment. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \nAG 14(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program \nof treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are fully established.

Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to provide \na basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6 14(e) is relevant because Applicant \nunderwent a court-ordered psychological evaluation in September 2017, and the \npsychologist concluded that he is not a pedophile. However, the offense to which he \npleaded guilty is not pedophilic conduct. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the Guideline D allegations under this guideline. The \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about \na person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not fully established, for the reasons set out in the discussion of \nGuideline D. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is not established. Although the prosecutor did not believe that was \nsufficient evidence to prove the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b beyond a reasonable doubt, the \nevidence during the forensic interview of his son in July 2018 was substantial evidence \nsufficient to establish it for the purpose of a security-clearance adjudication. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not fully established. Applicant has established a good employment \nrecord and substantial time has passed since the offenses. However, he has lived under \nclose scrutiny since he was sentenced in July 2018, and he will be on probation until July \n2023. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D and J in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. The evidence in this case was convoluted and \nconflicting. I have not discounted the possibility that Applicant\u2019s wife may have coached \nthe children to make accusations against Applicant, which were inconsistent with the \ncomments of the children during the first forensic interview, and which did not support any \nallegations of sexual misconduct. I have also considered the testimonials of Applicant\u2019s \nfriends, coworkers, and supervisors, who believe that the conduct alleged is inconsistent \nwith his character. I have considered the conclusion of a psychologist that Applicant is \nnot a pedophile. The conflicts in the evidence give me pause, but Applicant has not \nconvinced me that his plea of guilty to the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was improvident, \nnor has he convinced me that the statements of his son during the July 2018 forensic \ninterview were fabrications induced by his ex-wife. \nIn close cases, I am obligated to follow the mandate of the Supreme Court in Egan, \nsupra, and to resolve any doubt in favor of national security. \u201cOnce a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nagainst the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States. \nWhile on trips to the Dominican Republic, Applicant engaged in sexual \nintercourse and oral sex with prostitutes for money. That conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant revealed his involvement with prostitutes when he was interviewed in \nconjunction with a polygraph for his security clearance in September 2014, about a \nweek after he returned from his last trip to the Dominican Republic. Applicant\u2019s conduct \noccurred more than six years ago. He is remorseful and pledges the conduct will not be \nrepeated. Most of the important people in his life, including his wife and employer, are \naware of what he did. He would reveal his conduct to anyone else rather than succumb \nto blackmail or coercion. He presented a strong character case. I find the conduct is \nunlikely to recur, and it no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are applicable. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Tr. \nat 12-18) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i, which he \ndenied. He is 38 years old. He married in 2003, separated in 2011, divorced in 2019, and \nhas been engaged to be married since April 2019. He has two minor children. (Answer; \nTr. at 12, 24, 43; GE 1) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2000. He earned an associate\u2019s degree \nand attended college towards a bachelor\u2019s degree.

As of the date of the hearing and \nsince March 2020, he worked in the field of information technology for the Air National \nGuard (ANG). Both Department Counsel and Applicant confirmed at the hearing that \nApplicant was being sponsored for a security clearance. He was first granted a security \nclearance while he served in the U.S. military. (Tr. at 6, 22, 33, 42-43, 45, 49-50, 55-56, \n71-75, 94, 106; GE 1; AE L) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent consumer accounts totaling $9,333 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i), a $4,068 delinquent student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), three delinquent debts \nwith the U.S. Government totaling $2,007 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.g), and $21,802 in child \nsupport arrears (SOR \u00b6 1.j). The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and \ncredit reports from 2018, 2019, and 2020. (GE 1-4) \n2 \n \nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e attributed his delinquent debts to the following factors: \n(1) his ex-wife\u2019s failure to properly handle the family finances; (2) a lengthy divorce, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninitiated by him in 2014 but not finalized until January 2019, during which time he learned \nabout the extent of the delinquent debts incurred during his marriage; (3) a 2014 order \nthat he pay $800 monthly in child support and $20,000 in retroactive arrears; (4) a 2017 \nmodification of that order increasing his child support to $2,000 monthly when he became \na senior consultant for a DOD contractor and earned approximately $130,000 annually; \nand (5) his above-mentioned period of unemployment, during which time he was still \nrequired to pay $2,000 monthly in child support. (Tr. at 17-39, 41-109; GE 1-4; AE A-L) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant paid six of his ten delinquent debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e-1.i) and he was in the process of resolving the remaining four (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.d, 1.j). (AE A-K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a $6,096 charged-off car loan for a car Applicant and his ex-wife \npurchased in around 2009; she was the primary account holder and he was the \nsecondary. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife handled the family\u2019s finances when he was deployed \noverseas with the U.S. military. Unbeknownst to him, she did not make the car payments. \nShe also failed to do so during the divorce proceedings, even though he sent her money \nto make the payments. He accepted responsibility for the loan as part of finalizing his \ndivorce. While he initially had trouble accessing the account since he was not the primary \naccount holder, he made three monthly payments of $25 between April and June 2020 \nand two payments of $50 in July 2020. Documentation from the creditor reflects a balance \nof $6,045 as of May 2020. He plans to continue paying the account until it is paid in full. \n(Tr. at 51-55, 71-74, 104; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $4,068 student loan in collection. Applicant obtained the student \nloan to attend college in 2000 and it was placed in forbearance from 2002 to 2017, while \nhe served in the U.S. military. After his 2017 discharge, he forgot about the loan. He did \nnot receive any correspondence from the creditor after having moved several times from \nthe address in which he lived when he obtained the loan. The creditor located him in 2019 \nand offered him a loan rehabilitation, through which he made a $107 payment in January \n2019 and $150 monthly payments from February until June 2019, when he lost his \nsecurity clearance, his pay was significantly decreased, and he eventually lost his job that \nSeptember. He resumed making payments of $5 monthly through a rehabilitation program \nin December 2019. As of June 2020, his balance was $2,997. (Tr. at 55-59, 74-78, 86, \n96-97, 106; GE 1; AE B, C) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g are overpayments that Applicant received for his monthly U.S. \nmilitary housing allowance, in collection for $573 and $125, respectively. As soon as he \nlearned about them, he paid $400 and resolved the outstanding balance in October 2017. \nHe subsequently called the VA several times and verified that he does not owe anything \nfurther. (Tr. at 59-61; AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a $2,626 credit card in collection. Applicant obtained the credit \ncard in around 2008; his ex-wife was an authorized user. She incurred charges and failed \nto make payments on the card while he was deployed overseas. He accepted \nresponsibility for the card as part of finalizing his divorce. He located the creditor at the \nend of 2019 and began making payments. His friends also lent him some money, which \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe intends to repay, to help him pay this debt. He testified that the balance as of the date \nof the hearing was $2,000. (Tr. at 61-65, 78-79, 99-100; AE E, K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for $1,309 in moving expenses in collection. Applicant incurred these \nexpenses when he moved from his last duty station with the U.S. military to a location \nthat was not his home of record. He paid this debt through $100 monthly automatic \ndeductions from his ANG pay. His September 2018 ANG paystub reflects that this debt \nwas paid. (Tr. at 65-67, 79-80; AE F) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a $339 charged-off debt that Applicant incurred during his \nmarriage, though he was unaware of the nature of the debt. He paid it in November 2019, \nwhen he accepted responsibility for the debt as part of finalizing his divorce. He \nacknowledged that he also wanted to resolve this debt upon receiving the SOR. (Tr. at \n67-68, 80-82; AE G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is for an electric bill in collection for $167. Applicant incurred this bill \nwhen he moved and incorrectly believed that his deposit would be applied towards it when \nhe discontinued service. He paid it in November 2018. (Tr. at 68-69; AE H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is for a television and internet account in collection for $105. Applicant \nopened this account between around 2008 and 2010. Documentation from the creditor \nreflects that this debt was paid in November 2019. (Tr. at 69-70; AE I) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is for $21,802 in child support arrears. As previously discussed, \nApplicant was ordered in 2014 to pay $800 monthly in child support and $20,000 in \nretroactive arrears. The state Attorney General\u2019s (AG) Office of Child Support (OCS) \npulled $10,000 from his retirement savings account and applied it towards his arrears. In \n2017, when his child support obligation was modified to $2,000 monthly, the state AG\u2019s \nOCS began applying approximately $1,000 to his $10,000 arrears balance and the \nremainder towards his monthly obligation. He was unable to make any payments when \nhe became unemployed, but resumed making his child support payments in March 2020 \nwhen he became re-employed. His child support balance as of August 2020 was $13, \n194. As of the date of the hearing, he was seeking a modification to his child support \norder and his outstanding arrears balance to reflect the decrease in his income to $60,000 \nannually. (Tr. at 45-51, 82-94; AE J) \n \nApplicant has earned $60,000 annually since March 2020. He plans to continue to \nresolve his delinquent debts. He received debt counseling in 2017. While he considered \ndebt consolidation, he elected to resolve his finances on his own and with his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s \nadvice. He also keeps track of his finances through a credit monitoring service. (Tr. at 45-\n46, 70, 87-89, 101-109; GE 1; AE K) \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e testified. She and Applicant began dating in December 2013, \nwhen he was legally separated from his ex-wife, and they got engaged in April 2019. She \nholds a position of public trust in the U.S. Government. She testified that she was aware \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, knew that he paid several of them, and was in the process \nof paying his child support arrears.

(Tr. at 17-39) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. Thus, \nthe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He paid the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g in 2017, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h in 2018, and SOR \u00b6 1.i in 2019.

It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant received debt counseling in 2017. He is resolving his remaining delinquent \ndebts. He keeps track of his finances through a credit monitoring service and with help \nfrom his fianc\u00e9e. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are established. \nchild support in SOR \u00b6 1.j, as ordered in 2014 and modified in 2017, and he began \nrehabilitating his student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b in early 2019, until he could no longer afford \nto do so when he lost his job. He resumed rehabilitating his student loan in December \n2019. He also resumed paying his child support when he became re-employed. He \nintends to continue rehabilitating his student loan and paying his child support, while also \nseeking a modification of his child support order and arrears to reflect his reduced annual \nincome. Through his divorce, he also took responsibility for and began resolving the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.f, and he also intends to continue to pay these debts until they \nare fully resolved. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:    \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Tr. at 25, 28-30; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4; AE D) \nApplicant stated that he did not go into the department store intending to steal \nanything. He was in a hurry after work to buy a present for his son who was having a \nbirthday party that evening. He initially testified his son\u2019s birthday was July 12th, the day \nhe was arrested. When confronted with the information from his Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86), he admitted that his son\u2019s actual birthday was \nabout four months before the date Applicant was arrested. He stated his family took a \nvacation during his son\u2019s actual birthday, and they delayed having the party. He stated \nthat he got confused because it is difficult to memorize his children\u2019s birthdays. He also \ndenied that he testified that he was arrested on his son\u2019s birthday, even though he \ntestified to that fact just minutes previously. (Tr. at 100-107) \nApplicant stated that there was no price tag on the item he wanted, so he took \nthe price tag from a similar item that he thought was about the same price. He admitted \nthat he knew the item purchased was more expensive, but he did not know how much \nmore expensive. He stated that he thought it cost between about $150 and $250. He \npreviously worked for the department store chain, and he stated that it was not \nuncommon for there to be discrepancies between the price tag and what is rung up at \nthe register. He testified that he deeply regrets his actions and is remorseful, but he \ndoes not believe what he did was stealing because he did not intend to steal from the \ndepartment store and he offered to pay for the item. (Tr. at 25-30, 69-76, 100-107; GE \n1) \nApplicant worked as an electronics engineer for a branch of the U.S. military on a \nmilitary installation from October 2013 until he went on paid administrative leave (non-\nduty pay status) in January 2018. He had some difficulties with a new supervisor, and in \nSeptember 2017, he was required to complete a software training program offered by \nthe DOD. His supervisor noted the training was ordered \u201cbecause [Applicant\u2019s] \nperformance and contribution were severely inadequate and making it impossible for \nhim to perform duties required from his position as a [pay rate] Electronics Engineer.\u201d \nApplicant signed an agreement in September 2017 that the work for the training \nprogram would be his own, and that he was not to copy work from other employees or \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe Internet.

(Tr. at 21-22, 30-32; \nGE 1, 3, 5) \nApplicant submitted a training-program project for peer review in December \n2017. The reviewer did a search of the Internet and found that the project had been \ncopied from sources on the Internet with minor changes to the code. Applicant \nsubmitted a reworked project within a few days. His supervisor found that the code \nApplicant submitted was copied from another employee\u2019s submission with minor \nalterations. (GE 5) \nApplicant testified that he did not think that he did anything wrong because code \nis rarely written from scratch. It usually is modified from a template or other code. He \nstated that he changed about 20% to 25% of the code, which is substantial. He also \nstated that the course was conducted in a team environment, and the other student \nvoluntarily gave him her code. He admitted that in his Merit Systems Protection Board \n(MSPB) hearing (addressed below), the other student testified that she did not give him \nher code. He stated that he thought she was scared and did not want to get involved in \nhis problems. (Tr. at 31-37, 77-85, 96-99) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor discussed the incident with Applicant on December 19, \n2017. The discussion was documented in a form for his employee work folder and \nsigned by the supervisor and Applicant. It was noted on the form that the matter was not \nresolved. (GE 5) \nApplicant was issued a notice of proposed removal in late January 2018. It \nstated: \u201cThis is a notice of proposed action to remove you from [military branch] \nemployment to be effective not later than 30 calendar days after you receive this \nnotice.\u201d The reason for the proposed action was deliberate misrepresentation, based \nupon the two incidents of copying code, as addressed above. He was placed on non-\nduty pay status. It was noted that Applicant had no past disciplinary record, and he \nreceived a successful rating on his last performance evaluation. Disciplinary information \non three other unnamed employees was included for comparison purposes. Applicant \nthrough counsel (different lawyer and law firm than his attorney at his security clearance \nhearing) responded to the notice of proposed removal in mid-February 2018. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6; AE O)  \nApplicant was issued a notice of decision to remove on April 20, 2018. The notice \nindicated that the reasons stated in the notice of proposed removal were fully supported \nby the evidence and warranted his removal from employment with the military branch \n\u201ceffective 4/20/2018.\u201d Applicant was informed that he could challenge the removal \nthrough a grievance or if the removal becomes effective through an appeal to the \nMSPB. There were additional options if he believed the action was taken in reprisal for \nwhistleblowing or if it was based on unlawful discrimination. If he believed it was based \non unlawful discrimination, he could either appeal to the MSPB or file an Equal \nEmployment Opportunity (EEO) complaint, but not both. He was also notified that his \nplacement in a non-duty pay status was cancelled effective April 20, 2018.

(Tr. at 38-39, \n48-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE A-C) \nApplicant filed an appeal to the MSPB. He raised unlawful discrimination, based \non his race, color, national origin, and retaliation for prior protected activity (EEO \ncomplaint). He had a hearing before an MSPB administrative judge in September 2018. \nThe administrative judge issued the decision on October 3, 2018, affirming the military \nbranch\u2019s (agency) actions. The administrative judge found that \u201cthe agency proved both \nspecifications of its charge by preponderant evidence,\u201d and that \u201cthe agency proved \n[Applicant] knowingly provided incorrect information with the intention of deceiving the \nagency when he submitted the code hoping to pass it off as his own as alleged in both \nspecifications.\u201d (Tr. at 31; GE 8) \nApplicant through his attorney petitioned the MSPB to review and reverse the \nadministrative judge\u2019s decision. He sought \u201creversal of the Agency\u2019s decision in its \nentirety, [and] reinstatement of [Applicant] with all applicable backpay, attorney\u2019s fees, \nand all associated costs.\u201d The final decision of the MSPB is still pending. (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 8) \nApplicant submitted an SF 86 on October 1, 2018. Under Section 13A \u2013 \nEmployment Activities, he reported his dates of employment with the military branch as \n\u201cFrom (Month/Year) 10/2013 to (Month/Year) 05/2018 (Estimated).\u201d He wrote the \nreason for leaving the job was: \u201cLooking for better career prospects, professional growth \nand work opportunities.\u201d  \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \nFor this employment have any of the following happened to you in the \nlast seven (7) years? \n\uf0b7 Fired \n\uf0b7 Quit after being told you would be fired \n\uf0b7 Left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct \n\uf0b7 Left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance \nApplicant also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question. \nFor this employment, in the last seven (7) years have you received a \nwritten warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for \nmisconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy?  \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in April 2019.

He stated that he filed an \nEEO complaint, but the complaint was withdrawn when he voluntarily resigned in April \n2018. He was adamant that he was never officially terminated. He stated that his case \nwas being appealed before the MSPB because he wanted all allegations of plagiarizing \nand anything regarding a possible termination removed from his permanent government \nemployment record. His discussions about his arrest and copying code were consistent \nwith his testimony at his hearing. (GE 2) \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. He stated that he was told by \nthe attorney handling his MSPB appeal that he was still employed by the military branch \npending the appeal. He did not have a good explanation for why he listed that his \nemployment with the military branch ended in May 2018 if he thought that he was still \nemployed by the military. He stated that was a mistake. He testified that \u201cLooking for \nbetter career prospects, professional growth and work opportunities\u201d was accurate \nbecause he was already looking for a different job. He also admitted that he did not \nreport everything on the SF 86 because he \u201cwas afraid that [defense contractor \nemployer] would use that against [him] to deny [him] of [his] job.\u201d (Tr. at 37-52, 86-90; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE E-H) \nApplicant testified that he had never had a security violation. He testified he \nmisinterpreted the question about whether he had \u201creceived a written warning, been \nofficially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such \nas a violation of security policy,\u201d as being limited to security incidents. He also stated \nthat he answered \u201cno\u201d to that question because he was told that if he wins his MSPB \ncase, his employment record would be wiped clean. (Tr. at 51-57) \nApplicant admitted that he told the background investigator during his interview \nthat he voluntarily resigned his position with the military after being placed on paid leave \nfor three months pending an internal investigation into plagiarizing the intellectual \nproperty of another employee. He testified that was a truthful answer because he \nreceived a job offer from the defense contractor in February 2018, before the notice of \ndecision to remove was issued in April 2018. He also stated that he thought he would \nwin his MSPB appeal, and that he would \u201cresign\u201d from working at the group he was with \nat the military branch and seek a transfer to another group, or he would completely \nresign from working for the military branch. (Tr. at 57-66, 91-92) \nApplicant volunteers in his community, and he is active in his church.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant essentially denied having any wrongful intent on any of the SOR \nallegations. He stated that he did not intend to steal from the department store; he \nthought he was within the parameters of the training program when he copied code from \nsources on the Internet and from another employee; and he denied intentionally \nfalsifying the SF 86, essentially because he was or he thought he was still technically \nemployed by the military. \nI did not find Applicant credible. His explanations were rambling, inconsistent, \ncontradictory, and implausible. Of note are the following: \n\uf0b7 Applicant\u2019s statement that he was arrested on his son\u2019s birthday, and then his \ndenial that he testified to that fact; \n\uf0b7 His statement that the other student in the training program voluntarily gave him \nher code was contradicted by her testimony at the MSPB hearing; \n\uf0b7 His lack of a good explanation for why he listed that his employment with the \nmilitary branch ended in May 2018 if he thought that he was still employed by the \nmilitary branch; \n\uf0b7 His insistence that he gave an accurate answer on the SF 86 when he wrote that \nthe reason for leaving the job was: \u201cLooking for better career prospects, \nprofessional growth and work opportunities\u201d;  \n\uf0b7 His testimony that he misinterpreted the question about whether he had \n\u201creceived a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or \ndisciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security \npolicy,\u201d as being limited to security incidents. That explanation is inconsistent \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith his additional testimony that he answered \u201cno\u201d to that question because he \nwas told that if he wins his MSPB case, his employment record would be wiped \nclean; and \n\uf0b7 His admission that he did not report everything on the SF 86 because he \u201cwas \nafraid that [defense contractor employer] would use that against [him] to deny \n[him] of [his] job.\u201d  \nApplicant knowingly provided incorrect information with the intention of deceiving \nthe military branch when he submitted the code hoping to pass it off as his own. He \ncommitted criminal conduct resulting in his arrest for larceny by false pretenses. Those \nincidents reflect questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. His conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(d) is applicable as it relates to the workplace \nmisconduct. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable to the allegation that he was arrested \nfor larceny, because that conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the \ncriminal conduct guideline. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established.  \nThe evidence is inconclusive as to whether Applicant was completely terminated \nfrom his military employment in April 2018 or if he was still technically employed in a \nnon-pay status pending the MSPB appeal. SOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant. \nThe evidence is conclusive that Applicant did not \u201cresign\u201d from his employment; \nhe did not leave the job because he was \u201cLooking for better career prospects, \nprofessional growth and work opportunities\u201d; and he should have reported that he \nreceived a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for \nmisconduct in the workplace. I find that he intentionally provided false information on the \nSF 86 and during his background interview. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.h, and AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f relate to Applicant\u2019s suspensions in 2015 and 2016. Those \nallegations were based on a misreading of the evidence. Applicant was not suspended \nin 2015 or 2016. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f are concluded for Applicant.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes.

He did not accept responsibility for his conduct. \nHaving determined that he intentionally provided false information on the SF 86 and \nduring his background interview, I have also determined that his explanations that he \ndid not intentionally provide false information were also false. It would be inconsistent to \nfind his conduct mitigated.1 There are no applicable mitigating conditions, and none of \nthe conduct is mitigated. \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n1 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter evidence, but the favorable information is insufficient to overcome his \ndishonesty, questionable judgment, and unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019. As \nof May 6, 2019, Applicant owed approximately $13,106 in back taxes, interest, and \npenalties. No payments have been made towards this tax year. As further discussed \nbelow, Applicant is working on submitting an offer in compromise to the IRS. No further \ninformation was provided. (Government Exhibit 2 at 5; Tr. 39-41.) \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his Federal income tax return in a \ntimely manner for tax year 2014. The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019. As \nof May 6, 2019, Applicant owed approximately $27,629 in back taxes, interest, and \npenalties. No payments have been made towards this tax year. As further discussed \nbelow, Applicant is working on submitting an offer in compromise to the IRS. No further \ninformation was provided. (Government Exhibit 2 at 6; Tr. 39-41.) \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his Federal income tax return in a \ntimely manner for tax year 2015. The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019. As \nof September 9, 2019, Applicant owed approximately $28,686 in back taxes, interest, and \npenalties. No payments have been made towards this tax year. As further discussed \nbelow, Applicant is working on submitting an offer in compromise to the IRS. No further \ninformation was provided. (Government Exhibit 3 at 7; Tr. 39-41.) \n1.f. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his Federal income tax return in a timely \nmanner for tax year 2016. The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019. As of April \n23, 2019, Applicant owed approximately $17,755 in back taxes, interest, and penalties. \nNo payments have been made towards this tax year. As further discussed below, \nApplicant is working on submitting an offer in compromise to the IRS. No further \ninformation was provided. (Government Exhibit 3 at 8; Tr. 39-41.) \n1.g. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his Federal income tax return in a \ntimely manner for tax year 2017. The tax return was actually filed on January 8, 2019.

(Government Exhibit 3 at 9; Tr. 39-41.) \nAccording to an IRS document submitted by Applicant in August 2019 his account \nbalance was approximately $119,009. Applicant and his wife have been working on an \noffer in compromise to submit to the IRS for several months. Their first one was submitted \nwhen Applicant had a substantially higher income than he currently earnes. Applicant \nsubmitted as an exhibit an \u201cOffer In Compromise Pre-Qualifier\u201d worksheet that he and his \nwife had prepared. He also submitted IRS booklet 656 \u201cOffer In Compromise.\u201d However, \nApplicant did not submit a completed and signed offer in compromise. Nor is there any \nevidence that their offer in compromise had been received or accepted by the IRS. \n(Government Exhibit 3 at 11-12; Applicant Exhibits K, Q, and R; Tr. 44-45, 62-63.) \nTurning to Applicant\u2019s state taxes: \n1.h. Applicant admitted not filing a state tax return for tax year 2010. Applicant\u2019s \nwife again testified that they had been told by the state tax authorities and their accountant \nthat due to the statute of limitations no tax return was due for that year. (Answer 1; Tr. 57\u00ad\n58.) \n1.i. Applicant admitted not filing a state tax return for tax year 2011. Applicant\u2019s \nwife again testified that they had been told by the state tax authorities and their accountant \nthat due to the statute of limitations no tax return was due for that year. (Answer 1; Tr. 57\u00ad\n58.) \n1.j. Applicant admitted not filing state tax returns for the tax years 2013, 2014, \n2015, 2016, and 2017, in a timely fashion. Records from the state tax authority show that \nthe returns were all filed on January 4, 2019. Even though the returns were not filed until \n2019, it appears that Applicant and his wife reached a payment agreement with the state \ntax authorities to pay their back taxes at an earlier date. They have been making \nconsistent monthly payments since 2017. As of February 2, 2021, current balance was \n$9,028. (Government Exhibit 2 at 7-10, Exhibit 3 at 14-27; Applicant Exhibits E, F, G, and \nH; Tr. 58.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife stated that it was always her intention to file Federal and state tax \nreturns every year, but she was just procrastinating. Part of the reason for her \nprocrastination was the aftermath of their 20-year-old son\u2019s sudden death in 2008. They \nbegan to work on filing the back taxes because they were becoming concerned about the \nIRS and the amount of back taxes they owed. (Tr. 39-40, 56-57, 85-90.) \nTurning to the general consumer debts, SOR 1.k to 1.r. Support for the existence \nand amount of these debts is found in the credit reports in the record dated June 26, \n2020; and February 2, 2021.

They had to prioritize what debts they could pay. (Government \nExhibit 1 at Section 13A; Applicant Exhibits A and J; Tr. 50-51, 54-55.) \n1.k. Applicant denied owing $2,749 to a university for a past-due debt placed for \ncollection. According to Applicant this is a wrongful debt that the university is attempting \nto have him pay despite the fact they had been paid by the Federal government. Even \nthough Applicant believes he does not owe this debt, he made a one-time payment to a \ncollection agency to show his good faith. (Applicant Exhibit N at 5; Tr. 48-49, 83-87.) \nNeither SOR 1 nor SOR 2 contain subparagraphs 1.l or 1.m. \n1.n. Applicant admitted owing a bank $669 for a charged-off account. Applicant \nmade a payment arrangement with the collection agency and paid the agreed amount on \nFebruary 2, 2021, as shown by documentation from the creditor. This debt is resolved. \n(Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 49-50.) \n1.o. Applicant admitted owing a bank $1,869 for a charged-off account. Applicant \nmade a payment arrangement with the collection agency for a reduced amount and has \nmade three monthly payments for $34 each. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant \nExhibits B, N, and O; Tr. 51-52.) \n1.p. Applicant admitted owing a bank $2,721 for a charged-off account. Applicant \nmade a payment arrangement with the collection agency for a reduced amount and has \nmade three monthly payments of $34 each. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant \nExhibits B and O; Tr. 52-53.) \n1.q. Applicant admitted owing a bank $6,470 for a charged-off account. Applicant \nmade a payment arrangement with the collection agency and paid the agreed amount on \nFebruary 2, 2021, according to Applicant\u2019s wife. This debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibits \nB and C; Tr. 53.) \n1.r. Applicant admitted owing a bank $3,655 for a charged-off account. Applicant \nmade a payment arrangement with the collection agency for a reduced amount and has \nmade three monthly payments of $25 each. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibit \nB; Tr. 53.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from friends and his current \nlandlord.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:   \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns, as required, for \ntax years 2010 through 2017. He owes a considerable amount in back taxes, interest and \npenalties. He also had unpaid consumer debts. These facts establish prima facie support \nfor the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthose concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns, pay his taxes, or his \npast-due consumer debts: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant was extremely dilatory in filing his tax returns and attempting to resolve \nhis past-due consumer debts. It is true that Applicant has filed all the subject returns, \nalbeit late. That is not the sole determining factor. He does have an installment agreement \nwith the state tax authorities, and has several years of payments. This has reduced his \namount of delinquent state taxes significantly. However, Applicant has not resolved his \nunpaid Federal taxes at all, which total over $100,000. There is some evidence that \nApplicant was preparing an offer in compromise to submit to the IRS, but there is no \nevidence that it has been filed or accepted.  Applicant has just begun to resolve his \ndelinquent consumer debt. I have considered the facts of his work issues, his son\u2019s tragic \ndeath, and the dilatory conduct of his wife, who was managing the family finances. All \nthat considered, there remains the fact that there is little track record of Applicant resolving \nhis debts, with limited exceptions. With regard to his state tax issues, Applicant has \nresolved subparagraph 1.j. He also resolved the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.n and \n1.q. Applicant did not mitigate the remaining concerns over his income tax or consumer \ndebt issues. Guideline F is found against Applicant.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that he has resolved all of his tax and debt issues, or is likely \nto do so in the foreseeable future. If Applicant is successful in resolving these concerns \nover an extended period of time he may become eligible for national security eligibility. \nThe potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the \nevidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability \nfor a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n(No subparagraphs 1.l or 1.m.) \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o and 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 30-year-old warehouse technician for a defense contractor, employed since November 2016, but he has been on furlough since September 30, 2020, pending resolution of his security eligibility. Applicant refereed high school basketball games part time from November 2019 to February 2020. He also worked as a full-time security guard from 2013 to 2016, when his five-year-old niece accessed his unsecured firearm and discharged a round into his leg. He missed work as a result and incurred some of the medical debts listed in the SOR. Applicant graduated from high school in 2009, and earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2013. He is not married and has no children. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for security eligibility. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $51,709 in 12 delinquent debts. His debts include a charged-off car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a delinquent education loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), nine delinquent medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.k), and a student apartment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l. The remaining debts were denied with the explanations that the student loan was in good standing, the denied medical debts were removed from his credit report, or he could not locate records for the accounts. Applicant testified at the hearing that he purchased a vehicle in 2015, and it was voluntarily repossessed in 2016.

He is not married and has no children. \nThis is Applicant\u2019s first application for security eligibility. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $51,709 in \n12 delinquent debts. His debts include a charged-off car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a delinquent \neducation loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), nine delinquent medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.k), and a \nstudent apartment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l. The \nremaining debts were denied with the explanations that the student loan was in good \nstanding, the denied medical debts were removed from his credit report, or he could not \nlocate records for the accounts. \nApplicant testified at the hearing that he purchased a vehicle in 2015, and it was \nvoluntarily repossessed in 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant\u2019s mother assisted him with the \npayments, but she was unable to continue when she became ill and retired. He believes \nhe owes about $27,000, and has not taken any action to resolve the debt.  \nApplicant has a student-loan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) that was rehabilitated in January \n2019. He owes approximately $44,000. He testified that he made payments under the \nrehabilitation program until February 2020. He stopped payments on his student loans \nbecause he claimed that he was not obligated to continue paying due to a Federal COVID-\n19 \nstudent-loan-payment \ndeferral. \nA \nFederal \nstudent-loan-aid \nwebsite \n(https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus) advises that as of March \n2020, certain Federal education loan debtors may suspend payments through September \n2021. It is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s loans are included in this advisory.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s history of debt accumulation with no efforts to resolve them shows \nfinancial irresponsibility. His financial problems have been longstanding and remain a \nrecent concern. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant suffered injuries in two accidents, \nand job losses that likely resulted in an inability to satisfy debts. However, he has not \nshown a willingness or ability to address them during periods of employment. I am not \nconvinced he has acted responsibly to address his debts except for rehabilitating his \nstudent loan debt. The remaining debts have been ignored, apparently hoping that they \nwill be dropped from his credit report. \nApplicant has not taken action to address his remaining debts, and he has not \nsought help from a financial counselor. I am not persuaded that his financial condition is \nunder control or that it will not recur. Clearly, with his furlough status since September \n2020, and no other clear income prospects during the COVID economic crisis, it is unlikely \nthat he will be able to resolve his debts any time soon. No mitigating condition fully \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment status and past financial difficulties. However, I remain \nunconvinced of his overall financial responsibility and ability, intent, and desire to meet \nhis financial obligations in the future. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \n  Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c \u2013 1.l:  \n \n \n \n  Subparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n      Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n_______________________ \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in November 2015. He experienced unemployment for approximately \nfour months in 2015 and from July 2009 to May 2010. He served honorably in the U.S. \nNavy for 20 years, retiring in 2009 as a petty officer first class (E-6). He has a high \nschool diploma and an associate\u2019s degree. He has been married for over 30 years and \nhas two adult children. (Tr. at 6, 38; GE 1; SOR answer) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2014-2016 federal income tax \nreturns as required; his 2014-2015 state income tax returns as required; that he owed \ndelinquent federal taxes in the amount of approximately $1,932 for tax year 2017; and \nthat he owed delinquent state taxes in the amount of approximately $2,325 for tax years \n2012, 2016, and 2017. He admitted failing to file his federal and state tax returns and \nowing delinquent taxes to both entities in his June 2017 security clearance application \n(SCA), as well as in his SOR answer. He supplied documentation when answering \ninterrogatories that supported the delinquent tax debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d). (GE 1-2; \nSOR answer) \nApplicant attributed his tax problems to a number of things. He is the sole income \nearner for his family because his wife has been unable to work for the past 19 years due \nto serious medical issues. In 2011 or 2012, he neglected to adjust his wage \nwithholdings when his two children were no longer dependents for tax purposes. He \nalso became the guardian and conservator for his grandfather and his estate. The \nexpenses associated with performing these tasks added a financial burden for him. In \nMay 2015, Applicant had not filed his 2014 federal or state tax returns. He realized that \nhe would owe the IRS a significant amount. Also, his daughter\u2019s wedding was coming \nup later that month. He chose not to deal with his taxes then and paid for the wedding, \nthinking he would deal with the taxes after the wedding. In August 2015, he was laid off \nfrom his job and unable to address his tax issues. In November 2015, he was rehired on \na part-time basis, which became full time in April 2016. About the same time, he was \ninvolved in a motorcycle accident, which required him to go on short-term disability. The \ndisability payments were late in coming, adding to his financial troubles. He timely filed \nhis 2017 federal tax return, but he did not pay the amount he owed ($1,931). He \ndisclosed his tax issues when he completed his SCA in June 2017.

For tax year 2014, the \nIRS filed a substitute tax return for him in December 2018. For tax year 2015, IRS \nrecords show no return was filed as of February 2019. For tax year 2016, Applicant filed \nhis federal return late in October 2017, for which he was assessed a penalty. A \ndocument from the state department of revenue shows that Applicant had not filed his \n2015 state tax return and that he owed $2,325 in delinquent taxes. Applicant \nacknowledged that he owed both the IRS and the state for taxes from these unfiled \nyears, but he did not know what that amount was. (Tr. at 28-31; GE 3) \nApplicant hired a tax preparation service (TPS) in January 2020 to prepare his \n2014 and 2015 federal tax returns. He testified that he also engaged them to file his \n2018 and 2019 federal returns because they had not been filed. Documentation \nindicated that TPS was preparing Applicant\u2019s federal tax returns for years 2012-2019 \n(The untimely filings of Applicant\u2019s 2012-2013, 2018, and 2019 federal tax returns will \nnot be used by me for disqualification purposes, but I may use this information to \ndetermine credibility, whether mitigating conditions are applicable, and for the \napplication of whole-person factors). Applicant paid an investigation fee of $495 to TPS. \nFurther fees to TPS would be determined after the investigation. Applicant testified that \nhe paid TPS approximately $7,000 in monthly payments from February 2020 through \nNovember 2020. These payments came from his monthly military retirement pay. He \ndocumented the agreement for the investigation fee, but he did not document the \nmonthly payment agreement with TPS. (Tr. at 20, 22-23, 32, 36-37; GE C, F) \nApplicant did not provide copies of the federal tax returns prepared by TPS, even \nthough he specifically stated he would do so. He provided IRS account transcripts for \ntax years 2018 and 2019 showing that his 2018 return was filed in August 2020 and that \nhis 2019 return was filed in October 2020. An email from a TPS representative stated: \nWe have finished completing your 2018-2019 Tax Returns and received \nconfirmation from the IRS that they have finished processing. We are \ncurrently working on the final resolution for Tax Years 2012-2019. At this \ntime your case is being reviewed in the Resolution phase where we will \nexamine your penalties and your final balance. \n3 \n \nFrom this email, it is unclear what is meant by the \u201cfinal resolution for Tax years 2012-\n2019.\u201d There is no documentation showing that Applicant\u2019s 2014 and 2015 federal tax \nreturns have been filed. Additionally, while Applicant\u2019s 2019 federal account transcript \nshows that his refund of $1,288 was applied to his 2017 tax owed (2017 amount owed \nwas $1,931 as shown in SOR \u00b6 1.b), that amount was insufficient to satisfy the full \namount. There is no further indication of payments toward the remaining 2017 tax owed. \nApplicant provided documentation showing that his 2020 federal and state tax returns \nwere filed and that he is scheduled to receive refunds on both. Nothing shows that the \nreturns have been processed by the IRS or the state. Applicant admitted that he has not \ndone anything toward filing his missing state tax returns for 2014 and 2015 because he \nis waiting for his federal returns to be processed by the IRS first. He also does not know \nhow much he owes the state for delinquent taxes.

(AE B; SOR answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2014-2016 federal income tax returns and his \n2014-2015 state tax returns; and he accrued delinquent tax debts to both entities. He \nprovided no documentation that his tax returns have been filed or that he resolved his \ntax debts. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns from 2012 to 2019, excepting \n2017. He failed to file his state tax returns for 2014 and 2015 and perhaps longer. He \nfailed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. \nHis history of non-filing or delayed filing of his federal and state tax returns calls into \nquestion his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment, medical condition of his wife, unexpected \nobligations to act as a conservator, and his motorcycle accident were all conditions \nbeyond his control. However, he waited until 2020 to seek professional assistance for \nhis taxes. Even with that assistance, the record is unclear as to whether his 2014-2015 \nfederal tax returns were filed and what amount is owed. His state tax returns and debt \nhave yet to be addressed. Overall, the record evidence does not support that Applicant \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. His delayed efforts to \naddress his tax issues can be summed up as, \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d He presented no \nevidence that he was working with the IRS or the state tax authority to file his tax \nreturns. He failed to put forth good-faith efforts to address his tax issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \n20(d), and 20(g) do not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military and federal contractor service, his wife\u2019s medical \nissue, his periods of unemployment, and the circumstances surrounding his taxes. \nHowever, I also considered that he waited until 2020 to address his federal and state \ntax issues and those issues are still unresolved. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.d \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 11-13) He is a first-time applicant for \na secret security clearance. Obtaining a clearance would enhance his employability and \nupward mobility within his company. (GE 1; Tr. 13-14, 18, 52-53) \nApplicant received his high school diploma in 1986. He was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in international business in 2006, and was awarded a master\u2019s \ndegree in system engineering in 2011. (GE 1; Tr. 14-15) Applicant married in January \n1997, and has an adult son and an adult daughter; both are currently attending college \nand live at home. Applicant\u2019s wife is a homemaker and assists the elderly on a part-time \nvolunteer basis through their local church. (GE 1; Tr. 16-18, 58-59)  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that Applicant used marijuana/THC with varying frequency \nfrom 1980 to at least April 2019. (SOR) Applicant was introduced to marijuana as a \nteenager while growing up in a large metropolitan area on the East Coast. Marijuana \nwas readily available in Applicant\u2019s neighborhood and \u201cwas part of the community or \nenvironment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s marijuana usage transitioned from teenage peer pressure to a \ncoping mechanism to deal with an anxiety disorder. To cope with his anxiety disorder, \nApplicant estimated that he used marijuana \u201cabout two or three times a week\u201d during a \n40-year span. (Tr. 19-23, 45, 61)  \nApplicant did not seek professional help to deal with his anxiety disorder until his \nearly 30s in the 1995 to 1996 timeframe. His doctor at the time prescribed Klonopin, \nwhich was prescribed to him to alleviate the \u201cheavy brain activity [he] experienced, \nwhich overwhelmed [his] thought process and created the physiological changes that \nwere very uncomfortable to deal with and manage through this anxiety disorder.\u201d (Tr. \n23-24, 34, 67-68) Over time, Applicant learned that Klonopin had some undesirable \nlong-term side effects such as dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease and proved to be more \naddictive than marijuana. In consultation with his doctor, he reduced his Klonopin \ndosage. For example, Applicant\u2019s prescription indicated a consumption rate of two \ntablets a day; however, he took Klonopin on average two days a week. His usage \ndepended on work demands such as making a presentation. Applicant stated Klonopin \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nphysiologically reduces brain activity and allows him to breath. By doing so, he is able to \nformulate better planning. Marijuana had \u201cvery similar effects in some form or fashion.\u201d \nWhen Applicant used marijuana, he did so by smoking it during the evenings in the \nprivacy of his home. No one in Applicant\u2019s immediate family uses marijuana. After \nmarijuana was legalized in his state of residence, he obtained a marijuana card in about \n2011 and purchased marijuana at state-sanctioned dispensaries. Before that, he \nobtained marijuana from individuals with similar needs. (Tr. 24-26, 34-42, 44, 59-63, 65, \n69) \nOvercoming Applicant\u2019s anxiety disorder was a process that occurred over time \nand involved shifting from prescription drugs or marijuana to a faith-based platform. He \nbecame involved with his church and its men\u2019s bible study group. Applicant explained, \n\u201cSo, I made a promise to my Lord Jesus Christ, and I communicated to him that I \nwanted to get away from these artificial medications and work and build an \ninfrastructure that would help me with his grace, mercy and love on my life, to help me \nestablish something better than I had tried to establish.\u201d He found his bible study peers \nto be excellent role models, role models he never had growing up. (Tr. 27-28) In \naddition to his men\u2019s bible study group, Applicant is involved in other aspects of his \nchurch\u2019s ministry such as hospitality and ushering, and feeding and providing clothing to \nthe homeless. He also assists with a local community project rebuilding schools and \nprovides assistance where needed. (Tr. 27-29) \nApplicant made his commitment to stop using marijuana and become sober on \nApril 21, 2019, Easter Sunday. He stated: \nI made a deep, deep commitment to my Father in heaven that I was going \nto pursue this [with] even more diligence; with more firmer [resolve], you \nknow, that I was serious and that I needed His help and I needed Him to \nguide me, to provide me with the wisdom to interface me with the people \nthat I needed to build this infrastructure that, in my mind, was to alleviate \nme from having to medicate with these medications. (Tr. 29-30, 45-46, 59) \nIn addition to a faith-based platform, Applicant pursues a regimen of good \nnutrition and exercise. He has been seeing a forensic psychologist on a frequent basis \nsince June 2020, and remains open to seeking help, as needed. His psychologist \nprepared an extensive substance abuse evaluation, discussed below. Applicant also \nattended Narcotics Anonymous in August or September 2020, it is now almost two \nyears after he stopped using marijuana. He did so to reinforce his infrastructure to stay \non a path of sobriety. (Tr. 30-31, 42-52) Applicant credibly testified that he can be \ntrusted to no longer use marijuana. He referred to his proven career track record of \ndependability and reliability with his colleagues and client customers. He has always \ngiven them advice and service to the best of his ability. Applicant is very proud of the \nservice he provides to the country and hopes to continue that service.

Applicant had no experience \nwith the security clearance process during his previous 25-plus years in the aerospace \nindustry. (Tr. 53-55) During Applicant\u2019s November 20, 2018, Office of Personnel \nManagement Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI), he informed the investigator of his \nmarijuana use up until the time of his OPM PSI. His use of marijuana continued for \nabout six months after that interview. Applicant stated this marijuana use was on an \u201cas \nneeded\u201d basis, that he was not dependent on marijuana, and that its use was a \u201cmore \nnatural way to medicate.\u201d (Tr. 55-56; GE 2) \nWhen Applicant realized that using marijuana was incompatible with holding a \nsecurity clearance, he realized \u201cmarijuana had to go.\u201d (Tr. 40) Applicant\u2019s OPM PSI \ndefinitely had an impact on him. With coordinated treatment from his health care \nprofessionals as well as support received from his faith-based men\u2019s bible study group, \nApplicant was able to bridge the gap that marijuana provided in dealing with his anxiety \ndisorder. (Tr. 56-57) \nApplicant does not associate with anyone who uses marijuana. Applicant \nunderstands that any use of illegal drugs is not tolerated at his workplace or while \nholding a security clearance. (Tr. 63-64) This is the first time in Applicant\u2019s working \ncareer that he encountered a zero tolerance drug-free policy as it applies to the security \nclearance process. (Tr. 70) Applicant submitted three negative drug tests dated October \n7, 2020; September 11, 2020; and August 21, 2019. (Tr. 70-71; AE A, AE B, AE C)  \nOf particular note is a comprehensive Substance Abuse Evaluation dated \nNovember 9, 2020 that Applicant submitted. The report was prepared by a very well \ncredentialed forensic psychologist (Ph.D.), who has significant experience in evaluating \nsecurity clearance applicants under the auspices of the CIA, NSA, and DOD. Ph.D. \ndiagnosed Applicant with a Social Anxiety Disorder (DSM-5 300.23). Ph.D. did not give \nApplicant a diagnosis of Cannabis Use Disorder. He explained that Applicant did not \nmeet any of the 11 criteria for a substance use disorder, and added that Applicant \u201cused \ncannabis as an alternative to the benzodiazepine prescription he received for his \nanxiety disorder for many years.\u201d Ph.D. stated, \u201cTo a great degree of psychological \ncertainty, I have concluded that [Applicant] is free from any problems of drug or alcohol \nuse and pose[s] no risk to the national security as a result of his prior usage.\u201d (Tr. 71-72; \nAE D) \nIn addition to Ph.D.\u2019s Substance Abuse Evaluation, Applicant submitted a letter \nfrom his licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) dated November 11, 2020. \nLMFT stated Applicant has been under her care since June 28, 2020, with a diagnosis \nof Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) in order to increase his coping and to get support for his \nsobriety from cannabis. She noted that Applicant has shown high motivation, insight, \nand dependability in a consistent manner.

Applicant described him as a \u201cmentor in \nthe Christian faith.\u201d This individual has known Applicant for at least ten years. He \ndescribed Applicant as \u201ca diligent worker, constant learner, and man of integrity.\u201d He \ndescribed Applicant\u2019s volunteer work at their church, school, and community. (Tr. 73; \nAE G) Lastly, Applicant submitted his most recent work performance review effective \nJune 30, 2020, with a rating \u201cExceeds Expectations.\u201d The narrative of his evaluation \ndocuments the justification for achieving such a rating. (Tr. 74; AE I) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides one condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nThese proceedings were initiated after Applicant self-reported his history of \nmarijuana use on his October 30, 2017 SF-86, and later during his November 20, 2018 \nOPM PSI. Although a defense contractor has employed him since October 2017, he has \nnever held a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) is established. Further review is required. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) (1)(2)(3). \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004. \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the \nrecency analysis the Appeal Board stated:  \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s last drug use was April 2019, about 20 months before his hearing. His \ninitial exposure to marijuana occurred during his teenage years where drugs were \nreadily available in his neighborhood. His use continued as a form of self-medication \noccurring approximately two to three times a week to cope with an undiagnosed anxiety \ndisorder. In his mid-thirties, he consulted with a medical professional who diagnosed his \nanxiety disorder and prescribed Klonopin. Applicant took Klonopin, however, over time \nhe became concerned with the adverse long-term effects of taking a synthetic drug. He \nreverted to the natural drug of marijuana and when his state legalized marijuana, he \napplied for and received a marijuana card. It was not until he applied for a security \nclearance at his present job that his marijuana use became an issue. \nThe record is replete with compelling evidence that Applicant has turned the \ncorner on achieving marijuana abstinence. He recognizes the importance of being a \nhusband, father, and provider to his family. He also fully recognizes that there is no \nroom for any drug use during his current employment. Applicant has aggressively \nsought out professional and faith-based help to overcome his past use of marijuana and \nbecause of his efforts; he achieved 20 months of sobriety as of his hearing date. The \nabsence of evidence of more recent or extensive drug use, and his promise not to use \nillegal drugs in the future eliminates doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal drug use. In ISCR Case No. \n02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an unfavorable \nsecurity clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug \nuse was not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug \nabuse. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists three ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has entered a drug-free environment, achieved ongoing \npersonal growth, and changed his own life with respect to drug use. He does not \nassociate with anyone who uses marijuana and made lifestyle changes consistent with \nsobriety. He has abstained from marijuana use for about 20 months and has had no \nproblem in doing so. \nApplicant\u2019s letters from Ph.D., LFMT, and his bible study colleague document his \nstruggle to overcome his anxiety disorder demons. The road to sobriety has not been an \neasy one for Applicant. Applicant\u2019s work performance evaluation reflects the caliber of \nthe contribution he is making as an employee. His performance further reflects his work \nbehavior is not indicative of someone with a drug problem. As an employee and as a \nmember of his community, he is viewed as reliable, a constant learner, and an individual \nwith integrity. At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that future drug abuse is \nincompatible with his future career and family plans, and manifested a steadfast \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommitment to continue lifestyle changes consistent with total abstinence of \ninvolvement with marijuana and all other illegal drugs. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, I did so after assessing his demeanor, overall \ncandor on other matters, and reputation among his superiors and peers. Given the \ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s background, his explanation for his actions, and his \nsubsequent actions, I find credible his assertion that he will not use any illegal \nsubstance in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. Drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guideline H is incorporated \nin this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant has been and is willing to maintain conduct expected of one entrusted \nwith a security clearance. His employer, friends, and family support him. He has a \nhistory of stable employment and a strong work ethic. This support and self-\nintrospection should ensure his continued success. Applicant demonstrated the correct \nattitude and commitment to remaining drug free. The role that Applicant\u2019s faith played \nduring this process in crucial. It has perhaps served as Applicant\u2019s greatest motivator in \ndoing what is right for himself and his family. Considering his demeanor and testimony, I \nbelieve Applicant has learned from this experience, and is committed to remaining drug-\nfree. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n     Subparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On \nOctober 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The DOD CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

The case was assigned to me on January 30, 2020. \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February \n10, 2020, scheduling the hearing in Applicant\u2019s metropolitan area for March 24, 2020. The \nhearing was canceled due to COVID-19 related cessation of travel and courtroom \navailability. \nDOHA issued a notice of video teleconference on November 5, 2020, and the \nhearing was convened on November 13, 2020. Applicant was not represented by counsel \nat the hearing. Counsel entered an appearance on November 17, 2020, and requested \nthe hearing be reopened to permit additional testimony from Applicant and evidence, or \nin the alternative, he requested additional time to submit post-hearing evidence. I denied \nreopening the hearing, but granted extensions of time to file post-hearing evidence. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E. The \nrecord was initially held open until November 13, 2020, to permit Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. At the request of Counsel, that deadline was extended \nto November 30, 2020, and again to December 11, 2020. Applicant submitted additional \ndocuments collectively marked AE I, and they were admitted into evidence without \nobjections. DOHA received the hearing transcript on December 1, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 46-year-old avionics technician for a defense contractor, employed \nsince June 2018. He graduated from high school in 1991, and earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 1998. He was married in 2004 and divorced in 2015. Applicant has eight \nchildren between the ages of 14 and 27, but none live with him. This is Applicant\u2019s first \napplication for security eligibility. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal income tax \nreturns as required, for tax years 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also \nalleges Applicant failed to file Federal tax returns in a timely fashion for tax years 2016 \nand 2017. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Also, the SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to State \u201cA\u201d for \ndelinquent taxes from 2002, 2003, 2009, and 2011 in the amount of $25,332. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nFinally, the SOR alleges Under Guideline E that Applicant falsified his June 7, 2018 SCA \nby deliberately failing to disclose that he failed to file or pay Federal or state taxes, as \nlisted as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) Applicant admitted all but the first SOR \nallegation with explanations. He noted in his Answer to SOR \u00b6 1.a, that his Federal \nincome taxes have been filed, and he is currently making payments. As to SOR \u00b6 1.b, he \nstated that his federal taxes were not filed in a timely fashion, but have since been filed. \nIn response to SOR \u00b6 1.c, he stated that his \u201cstate tax is in process as of the date of this \nSOR.\u201d As to the SCA falsification allegation, Applicant answered that it was an oversight \non his behalf, and that he revealed his mistake to his investigator during the interview. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Federal tax issues date back to at least 2002. He testified that he was \npreviously on a Federal tax repayment plan, but did not know the dates. His IRS tax \ntranscripts show a refund due in 2008 was credited toward taxes owed in 2003 and 2005. \n(GE 3)  A tax refund due in 2009 was credited for taxes owed in 2002. Applicant testified \nthat negligence on his part resulted in this situation. He is making installment payments \nfor his Federal income tax debts, and he has an installment plan to pay his state tax debt. \nAs to the SOR tax filing allegations, he admitted that he did not file tax returns as \nalleged, but testified that he filed 2008 to 2016 tax returns in 2018, and that the 2017 and \n2018 returns were filed on time. His 2010 tax return has yet to be filed. Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony as to filing dates was contradicted by the tax returns submitted after the \nhearing. Also, Applicant testified that he filed his 2019 tax return, but did not pay the tax \nowed because he did not know whether he would have a job after the November \nelections, despite having about $25,000 in savings. Applicant testified that he started \nusing an accountant in 2018 or 2019, to assist him with his tax return submissions. \nApplicant testified that he agreed to a Federal installment repayment plan in \nOctober or November 2018. However, in his post-hearing submission, he provided an \nIRS letter showing his agreement to a Federal installment agreement beginning in \nOctober 2019. (AE F) Applicant\u2019s IRS installment agreement statement dated September \n23, 2020, shows that he owes Federal taxes for 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2018. (AE A) He \ntestified that he also owes about $4,000 for unpaid 2019 taxes. Applicant\u2019s agreement \nwith the IRS was to pay $250 per month. He provided evidence that he made inconsistent \nFederal tax payments under the plan in November 2019 (three payments totaling $500); \nJanuary \u2013 March 2020; August 2020; September 2020 (two payments totaling $500); and \nOctober 2020. (AE E) He testified that from June to November, he only made two \npayments because his work hours were reduced from February to June 2020 due to \nrolling furloughs. However, he lost only two weeks of pay during that period, totaling about \n$2,400. \nApplicant\u2019s state tax delinquencies date from 2002 through 2009, and 2011. He \nmade payments toward state taxes owed in 2004, 2011, and 2019. (GE 3) Applicant \ntestified that his state \u201cA\u201d tax returns were filed in 2018, and that he has a balance of \napproximately $25,000. No documentary evidence was submitted showing when his state \ntax returns were filed. Applicant did not volunteer his tax delinquency with State \u201cA\u201d during \nhis personal subject interview. In fact, made a point of noting to the investigator, that his \ntax delinquencies involved \u201cjust Federal taxes as [state \u201cB\u201d] does not have state taxes.\u201d \n(GE 2) \nAs of July 21, 2020, Applicant owed the state $6,967 in tax, $2,552.51 in penalties, \n$15,489.18 in interest, with a balance of $25,007.69. (AE B) He made a payment under \na state installment plan in June 2020, and another payment in September 2020. He noted \nthat he has not made regular monthly payments under the plan. After the hearing, \nApplicant secured a new payment plan dated December 1, 2020, requiring payments of \n$200 per month for 12 months, starting on December 30, 2020. This payment plan will \npay $1,103.33 toward his current total balance due, but does not resolve the total tax \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndebt. (AE F) He noted in his testimony that he missed state tax payments so that he can \nmake federal tax payments. \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided Federal tax returns showing his \n2019 return was filed on December 1, 2020, and he owes $4,638. Applicant\u2019s submission \ndoes not show when the 2018 return was filed. His 2017 return was filed on April 2, 2019, \nand his 2012 through 2016 tax returns were filed in March 2019. (AE F) These \nsubmissions contradict Applicant\u2019s testimony as to when he filed his delinquent returns, \nand his claim that the 2017 (and maybe 2018) Federal tax returns were filed on time. \nApplicant testified that by 2014 or 2015, his financial life improved to allow him to \ncatch up on debts, taxes, and savings. Although he was aware that he owed tax debts, \nhe was fearful of using his savings to pay debts. He decided to accumulate savings rather \nthan address his tax debts. In June 2018, he completed his SCA, but failed to disclose \nthat he failed to file tax returns, or owed Federal and state taxes. He testified that he was \naware of his debts, but did not know how much he owed because he had not filed returns. \nDuring his November 2018 interview by a Government investigator, he volunteered \u201cthat \nhe does have a few years of taxes that he needs to file, which weren\u2019t listed due to error,\u201d \nand stated that \u201che needs to file 4 or 5 years\u2019 worth of taxes since he\u2019s been in [state \u201cB\u201d].\u201d \nGE 2) \nApplicant testified that he traveled on vacation to Antigua, Canada, and England \nin 2017, and again to England in 2018 or 2019. He also travels to Las Vegas, but does \nnot gamble. He owes about $100,000 in a recreational vehicle debt (current) and student \nloans (deferred until December 2020). In 2014, he testified that he had delinquent student \nloans and medical debts, but he is now current. He stated that he hoped to pay his tax \ndebts by 2021. \nApplicant has about $25,000 in a savings account, $500 to $1,000 in a checking \naccount. He has about $40,000 in a 401k retirement plan, and just before the hearing, he \ntook out a loan for $20,000. Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income in 2018 was $93,727 and \n$118,624 in 2019. He testified that he expected to make about $100,000 in 2020. \nApplicant testified that despite the availability of funds, he did not plan to pay his taxes \nuntil 2021, because he believed it to be more valuable to have savings. He also testified \nthat he hoped to hire legal counsel to assist him in not paying the total tax debts that he \nowes. He has not had financial counseling. \nApplicant submitted credit agency scores and a character letter from a work \nsupervisor who noted Applicant was one of his best employees, dependable, talented, \noutstanding, and self-directed with no disciplinary issues or infractions. Finally, Applicant \nincorrectly claimed in his post-hearing submission that the government investigator \nconcluded in Applicant\u2019s subject interview summary stating that Applicant\u2019s background \ncannot be used to blackmail or coerce him. As a matter of practice, Government \ninvestigators do not make conclusions or evaluations of the interviewee\u2019s security status \nin the subject interview summaries. Rather, statements such as this typically denotes an \nApplicant\u2019s summarized response to a related question. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held: \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. ISCR Case No. 14-\n04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016); Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union, \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 \n(1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests that an applicant \nhas a problem with abiding by well-established government rules and \nregulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for \nprotecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). Someone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nApplicant\u2019s long history of failing to fulfill his Federal and state tax obligations \nshows a history of financial irresponsibility. His financial problems have been \nlongstanding and remain a current concern. A debt that became delinquent several years \nago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a \ncontinuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nAlthough Applicant has filed most of his delinquent tax returns (except 2010), and \nhas recently begun to reignite his Federal and state installment plans, he has shown an \ninability or unwillingness to make consistent payments on those plans, and did not begin \nto address his tax issues until he was interviewed by a Government investigator in \nNovember 2018, with the late filing of tax returns beginning in the spring of 2019. His \nactions appear to be in response to his desire for security eligibility, rather than a legal \nand moral obligation to abide by Federal and state laws and regulations. His newfound \ninterest in complying with the law amounts to too little, too late. I am not convinced that \nsimilar behavior will not recur, and he continues to carry a substantial debt to the IRS and \nstate tax authorities despite his personal savings and substantial income. Despite \nknowing of the Government\u2019s concerns from his personal subject interview, SOR, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterrogatories, and hearing, Applicant testified that he chose to keep a substantial \namount of cash in his savings account, and did not intend to use it to pay his tax debts. \nAlthough failure to pay Federal taxes when due was not alleged in the SOR, it is \nappropriate to consider it: \n(a) to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate his evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether \nhe has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a \nparticular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to \nprovide evidence for whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006).  \nOverall, I believe Applicant preferred to ignore his tax obligations while enjoying \npersonal travel and a substantial savings account. Based on the record presented, I am \nunable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control or are unlikely to \nrecur. Applicant is credited for eventually filing most of his outstanding tax returns and \nentering into IRS and state tax repayment plans. However, that mitigating credit does not \neliminate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s overall financial irresponsibility as it \nrelates to meeting Federal and state income tax obligations when required. He has not \nestablished a reliable track record of addressing his tax obligations when due, and he has \nnot participated in any financial counseling. I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to voluntarily abide by \ngovernment rules and regulations. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant did not disclose his long history of failure to file or pay taxes as required, \non his SCA, despite being fully aware of the matter. The Appeal Board has cogently \nexplained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). The record evidence establishes that Applicant intentionally \nfalsified his 2018 SCA. The evidence shows that Applicant clearly was aware of the \nexistence of the tax debts and unfiled tax returns when he completed his SCA, although \nhe may not have been aware of the total amount of taxes he owed. Applicant discussed \nhis failure to file tax returns with the government investigator during his PSI, but did not \nvolunteer that he owed a substantial amount to state \u201cA\u201d in delinquent taxes, interest, and \npenalties. Although his failure to disclose his state tax status in his subject interview was \nnot alleged in the SOR, it may be considered for the purposes as previously stated under \nGuideline F. AG \u00b6\u00b616(a) and (b) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nMitigating conditions \u00b6\u00b6 17 (a) and (e) are applicable to Applicant\u2019s circumstances, \nhowever I am concerned about the degree of his egregious, intentional falsification of his \nSCA. Applicant was well aware of his long-standing history of tax deficiencies, but failed \nto disclose them, ostensibly because he did not know how much he owed. This knowing \nand willful behavior is strongly disfavored in security eligibility determinations. There are \nno possible grey areas to hide behind in this regard. \nApplicant ignored fully and truthfully answering such a clear and unambiguous \nquestion, likely in an attempt to avoid disclosing the extent of his tax problems. His later \nadmission of having a \u201cfew years\u201d of taxes to file does not fully mitigate the prior conduct. \nIn addition, I am considering that he did not voluntarily disclose the extent of his tax-\nrelated debts to State \u201cA\u201d in his subject interview in my evaluation of Applicant\u2019s credibility, \nmitigation, rehabilitation, and whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Overall, \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment status and performance, past financial difficulties, arrangements \nto pay his taxes, and efforts to late-file his tax returns. However, I remain unconvinced of \nhis overall financial responsibility and ability, intent, and desire to meet his tax obligations \nin the future, and willingness to report his financial circumstances when required. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December 9, 2019, detailing national \nsecurity concerns under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations).

In his \nAnswer, he admitted 10 of the 11 allegations set forth in the SOR. He provided no details \nexplaining how he became indebted or the steps he has taken to resolve his debts, except \nthat he claimed one debt was paid in January 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and the amount of another \ndebt had been reduced by $4,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \nOn March 30, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \nin a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which included 11 documents identified as Items \n1-11. On April 13, 2020, the FORM and the 11 attachments were sent to Applicant. He \nreceived the documents on December 14, 2020.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to most of the SOR \nallegations, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant, age 50, is divorced, and presently cohabitates with his fianc\u00e9e.

The \ndebts listed in the SOR and the relevant evidence in the record are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, Unfiled Federal and State Income Tax Returns for 2017. Applicant \nvolunteered in the Interview that he had not filed his 2017 tax returns due to \nprocrastination. In 2017, he was self-employed for the first nine months of the year. He \nintended to file the returns with his 2018 returns, but he admitted the allegation of the \nunfiled 2017 returns in his January 21, 2020 Answer. This financial obligation is not \nresolved. (GE 2 at 1.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, Judgment Entered in the Amount of $8,542. On October 15, 2018, a credit \nunion obtained a judgment against Applicant on a debt arising from a car loan. He opened \nthis account in April 2014 and defaulted on the loan in September 2017. In the Interview, \nhe blamed his default on the loan and failure to pay the judgment on problems with his \nfood-truck business. He has made no payments on this debt. This debt is not resolved. \n(GE 4 at 7; GE 5 at 1; GE 9 at 3.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, Judgment Entered in the Amount of $11,524. On May 15, 2018, a financial \ncompany obtained a judgment against Applicant on a debt-consolidation loan that was in \ndefault. Applicant was unable to pay this debt due to problems with his food-truck \nbusiness. The creditor garnished his wages, and as the date of the Interview, it had \ncollected about $6,000 of the debt. The balance due at that time was about $14,000. In \nhis January 21, 2020 Answer, Applicant wrote that the amount of the debt had been \nreduced to $7,157. The balance due as of the most recent credit report in the file, dated \nMarch 30, 2020, was $4,846. This debt is not yet resolved. (GE 4 at 5; GE 6 at 1; GE \n9 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, Judgment Entered in the Amount of $1,152. On October 25, 2017, a credit \nunion obtained a judgment against Applicant on a credit-card account that was in default. \nApplicant was unable to pay this debt due to problems with his food-truck business. This \naccount was opened in July 2014. Applicant defaulted on the payments in January 2017. \nHe has made no payments on this judgment since then. This debt is not resolved. (GE \n4 at 5-6; GE 7 at 1; GE 9 at 3-4; GE 10 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, Judgment Entered in the Amount of $2,000.

This credit-card debt is the same \ndebt that was subsequently converted into a judgment and is the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.d, \ndiscussed above. The record evidence reflects that Applicant only had one credit-card \naccount with this credit union. This debt is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. (GE 4 at 5-6; GE 9 at 3; GE 10 at 2; GE 11 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, Collection Account in the Amount of $422. Applicant defaulted on a credit \ncard and the account was referred to a collection agency. In his Interview, he attributed \nhis failure to pay the credit card to his problems with his food-truck business. He has \nmade no payments on this debt. This debt is not resolved. (GE 4 at 6; GE 9 at 2-3; GE \n10 at 2; GE 11 at 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, Unpaid Bank Overdraft Expense Charged Off in the Amount of $390. \nApplicant failed to repay an overdraft on a bank account and the institution charged off \nthe debt. The debt was first listed on a June 2019 credit report in the record. It was not \nlisted on the Government\u2019s original investigative credit report so the report in the record \nsummarizing the Interview makes no mention of this debt. In the March 2020 credit report \nin the record, the debt is shown as unpaid. This debt is not resolved. (GE 9 at 3; GE 10 \nat 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, Unpaid Bill for Medical Services in the Amount of $131. Applicant has an \nunpaid medical bill. As of the March 2020 credit report in the record, this debt remains \nunpaid. This debt is not resolved. (GE 4 at 6; GE 9 at 2; GE 10 at 2; GE 11 at 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j, Unpaid Bill for Medical Services in the Amount of $100. Applicant has a \nsecond unpaid medical bill.

(GE 4 at 6; GE 9 at 2; GE 10 at 2; GE 11 at \n5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k, Collection Account in the Amount of $376. Applicant has an unpaid bill \nwith an internet or cellphone provider. In his Interview, Applicant reported that he was \nunaware of this debt and that he had an active account with the same creditor at the time \nof the Interview. As of the March 2020 credit report in the record, the debt remains unpaid. \nThis debt is not resolved.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required, \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Six of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts remain unpaid, are frequent, and are likely to recur. They cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He suffered a setback \nwith his failed food-truck business. His problems were compounded by the final illness of \nhis fianc\u00e9e\u2019s father. Both were conditions beyond his control. Rather than address his \ndelinquent business debts, Applicant merely walked away from them. He has not acted \nreasonably under the circumstances. Also, he has not obtained financial counseling or \ntaken any steps to begin repaying his debts in good faith. He disputes one debt claiming \nit was paid, but failed to provide documentation to support his claim. Lastly, he has not \nsubmitted any evidence showing that he filed his 2017 tax returns. None of the above \nmitigating conditions have been established. \nApplicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing. In light of the record as a whole, Applicant failed to carry his burden to \nestablish mitigation of the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as to Applicant=s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the applicable \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis indebtedness. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g through 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate financial concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a \nsensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 26, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 6, 2020, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

Allegedly, the listed delinquent debts in the SOR remain \nunresolved and outstanding. \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom approximately 1980 to approximately 2015 and (b) used marijuana with varying \nfrequency while holding a security clearance from approximately 2010 until \napproximately 2015. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use involved the illegal use of \ncontrolled substances and raises questions about her reliability and trustworthiness. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations without \nexplanation. \nHer answers, as such, reflect unqualified admissions that require no \nprobative evidence of the facts alleged. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year-old production control planner for a defense contractor \nwho seeks continuation of her security clearance.

(Item 4) Offered an opportunity by the OPM investigator to \nprovide additional information about her delinquent accounts and her payment progress \nwith the debt consolidation service and its successor, Applicant failed to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s drug activities \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency (roughly twice a year) from \napproximately 1980 to approximately 2015. (Item 4) Between approximately 2010 and \napproximately 2015, she used marijuana with varying frequency while holding a security \nclearance. (Item 4) She estimated to have used marijuana between 2010 and 2015 \napproximately 10 times, mostly at parties, concerts, and with others in social gatherings. \nShe has received no counseling or treatment for drug abuse. \nSince 2015, Applicant has not used marijuana. Nor has she socialized or \nassociated with persons that use marijuana or any other illegal drugs since 2015. (Item \n4) Applicant assured she will not use marijuana or any other illegal drugs in the future \nbecause she does not want to \u201cjeopardize her career.\u201d (Item 4) \nThe administrative record does not include any documentation to challenge \nApplicant\u2019/s post-2015 drug-free assurances. Considering all of the circumstances \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s past history of marijuana use, her assurances that she has \nremained drug-free since her last use in 2015 are accepted. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n                                           \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must \nbe considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n Financial Considerations \n \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying \nconditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for financial considerations apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s \nuse of marijuana, both before and after she acquired a security clearance. \nFinancial concerns \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create  \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 at 3 (App. Bd.

While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23, 2016; ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with her delinquent debt accruals raise \nconsiderable concerns over her ability to manage her finances in a responsible and \nreliable way. \nExtenuating circumstances do not appear to have played any cognizable role in \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt accumulations. She reported consistent employment with \nthe same employer since 1989. She provided no persuasive explanations, however, as \nto (a) why she allowed her accounts to become delinquent; (b) why she has failed to \ntake any documented steps to address her delinquent accounts; and (c) what plans she \nhas to address them. \nDrug-use concerns \n \nSecurity concerns are raised as well over Applicant\u2019s possession and use of \nmarijuana and her continued use of marijuana after being granted a security clearance \nin 2010. On the strength of the evidence presented, three disqualifying conditions of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for drug involvement apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), \u201cany substance misuse\u201d; 25(c); \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia\u2019; and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access \nto classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana with varying frequency (regularly but \nmostly infrequently) over a 35-year period before abandoning her use of marijuana \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naltogether in 2015. Between approximately 2010 and approximately 2015, she used \nmarijuana with the same varying frequency while holding a security clearance. (Item 4) \nShe estimated to have used marijuana between 2010 and 2015 approximately 10 times, \nmostly at parties, concerts, and with others in social gatherings, and has received no \ncounseling or treatment for drug abuse before or since her last use in 2015. \nBased on a review of the administrative record in this case, several mitigating \nconditions under the drug involvement guideline are available to Applicant. DC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; and 26(b), \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, \nincluding, but not limited to: (1) dissociation from drug-using associates and contacts \nand (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are used,\u201d apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, while of a lengthy duration extending over \na 35-year period, was generally infrequent and mostly practiced in social situations at \nparties, concerts, and with others in social gatherings. She has since given up all use of \nmarijuana and no longer attends or participates in parties and social gatherings where \nmarijuana is used. With over five years of observed abstinence from illegal drug use, \nsafe predictions can be made at this time that she will not return to marijuana use in the \nforeseeable future \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her accrued delinquent debts and her failure to address them \nheretofore are otherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a security \nclearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for her contributions to the defense \nindustry, her efforts are not enough at this time to overcome her accumulated \ndelinquent debts and her lack of a good track record for dealing with them. Because her \nuse of marijuana (including her continued use while holding a security clearance) is \naged (over five years) and unlikely to recur, drug involvement concerns are mitigated by \nthe passage of time. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that while drug involvement \nconcerns are mitigated, financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1-rri:                           Against Applicant \n \nGUIDELINE H (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):        FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:  \n \n   For Applicant \n \n \n        \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n1  Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems, which are unresolved and ongoing. I have reviewed all of the \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and conclude none are fully applicable. \nApplicant has done little to help himself, as shown by the lack of documentation in his \nanswer to the SOR or his reply to the FORM. There is no reliable documentation to \nshow that he has initiated a realistic plan to address the numerous delinquent debts. In \nparticular, his claims that he has a law firm helping him and has been in a monthly \nrepayment plan since June 2018 are unproven beyond his statements. Likewise, his \nattribution to his former girlfriend consists simply of his claim without any corroborating \ninformation. \n4 \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant began using marijuana sporadically in college, at first about \nonce every four or five months or so. (Tr. p. 27) From 2015 until mid-2016, he used \nmarijuana weekly. By 2016, toward the end of college, he was using it on a monthly \nbasis. He did not use it again until March 2017 when he used it on a weekly basis until \nNovember 2018 when he stopped. (Government Exhibit 1.) \n \nIn March 2017, Applicant was hired by his current employer as a Facilities \nEngineer.  At that time, Applicant was given a company handbook that set forth the \nrules and regulations prohibiting illegal drug use.  Applicant also understood that all \nemployees were subject to random drug testing.  Despite receiving this information, \nApplicant continued to use marijuana from March 2017 until November 2018.  He \ntestified that he used marijuana to relax and for recreation because he enjoyed it.  (Tr. \np. 22.)  He also described an ankle surgery he had in August 2017 where he obtained a \nmedical marijuana card in order to purchase it.  He contends that he purchased \nmarijuana legally from marijuana dispensaries.  He normally used marijuana at his \nresidence with apartment mates while playing video games.  (Tr. p. 23.)  Applicant \ntestified that he continues to associate with his friends who use marijuana.  (Tr. p. 24.) \nHe currently lives with his best friend who uses marijuana in their apartment several \ntimes a week.  When other friends come over to Applicant\u2019s home, they use marijuana \nwith Applicant\u2019s roommate in Applicant\u2019s presence.  (Tr. p. 26.)

On \npage 35 of the same questionnaire, Applicant explained that he intends to use \nmarijuana in the future because it is now legal in the state where he resides. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) \nIn November 2018, Applicant met with an OPM investigator and was asked about \nhis future intent to use marijuana. \nApplicant initially told the investigator that he \nintended to continue using and purchasing marijuana in the future. (Government Exhibit \n2.) \nApplicant stated that he changed his intent during the interview when the \ninvestigator told him that although marijuana use is legal in his state, it remains illegal \nunder Federal law. Applicant testified that he now has no intent to use or purchase \nmarijuana in the future due to the fact that his job requires a federal security clearance. \n(Tr. p. 22.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue  such misuse. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant has used marijuana, \nfrom April 2011 to about November 2018. He used it before being hired by a defense \ncontractor, after being hired by a defense contractor, and even after applying for a \nsecurity clearance, disregarding DoD policy, company policy and Federal law. Although \nhe claims that he did not know its use was illegal under Federal law, he knew or should \nhave known that by applying for a Federal security clearance, he is subject to Federal \nlaw. Although he states that he discontinued his use of marijuana in November 2018, \nApplicant continues to associate with people who use marijuana, specifically his current \nroommate, allowing marijuana to be used in his presence, and in his home. Applicant is \na college-educated man whose actions show immaturity and poor judgment that is \ninexcusable. \nHe does not show the requisite good judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live his life to his \nconvenience, and has disregarded the law. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant does not show the requisite character or judgment of someone who has the \nmaturity, integrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. At this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to \nclassified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. While holding a security clearance one is \nexpected to show responsibility and good judgment. Applicant has not demonstrated \nthe level of maturity needed for access to classified information. \nThis is not an \nindividual with whom the Government can be confident to know that he will always \nfollow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. He is \nnot qualified for access to classified information. \nApplicant does not meet the \nqualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

National security eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 23, 2018, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA). The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on September 25, 2019, setting forth nine allegations under \nGuideline F and two allegations under Guideline B. The DoD CAF acted under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 23, 2020, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR (Answer). She \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On March 2, 2020, a member of DOHA\u2019s staff emailed Applicant \nadvising her that a package containing the Government\u2019s evidence was sent to her along \nwith other procedural instructions for her hearing. On March 11, 2020, the case was \nassigned to me. The hearing on the case was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \nApplicant was contacted by a Department Counsel on May 7, 2020, updating her on the \nscheduling of her hearing. On May 16, 2020, Applicant acknowledged receiving this email \nthread, which included the March 2, 2020 email from DOHA\u2019s administrative personnel. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 1, 2020, scheduling the hearing for October \n27, 2020. \nImmediately before the commencement of the hearing, Applicant represented that \nshe had not received the Government\u2019s evidence, notwithstanding the earlier \ncommunications. Department Counsel provided additional copies of its evidence to \nApplicant, and the hearing was delayed 30-40 minutes to give Applicant time to review \nthe Government\u2019s evidence. Once the hearing commenced, Department Counsel \npresented six proposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. I \nmarked the email thread with correspondence dated March 2, 2020; May 7, 2020; and \nMay 16, 2020 as Hearing Exhibit I. I marked Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit list as Hearing \nExhibit II. Department Counsel also submitted a Request for Administrative Notice with \nrespect to country conditions in the Philippines.  \nI gave Applicant additional time during the hearing to review GE 2, which is the \nsummary of her January 11, 2019 background interview. Applicant offered no \ndocumentary evidence at the hearing, but requested additional time to submit proposed \nexhibits after the hearing. I granted her request and gave her a deadline of November 10, \n2020. On November 5, 2020, she sent two emails to DOHA with two proposed exhibits, \nwhich I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B. I also marked Applicant\u2019s two emails \nas Hearing Exhibits III and IV. In Hearing Exhibit IV, she wrote that she was waiting for \ncorrespondence from another, possibly more, creditor(s). She made no further \nsubmissions and did not request additional time. Accordingly, the record closed on \nNovember 10, 2020. (Tr. at 13-16, 67.) \nAbsent any objections, I admitted all exhibits into the record. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on November 4, 2020. \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nApplicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s Request for Administrative \nNotice of facts about the country conditions in the Philippines. I have taken administrative \nnotice of the certain facts contained in the request that are supported by source \ndocuments, which are official U.S. Government publications. These facts are summarized \nin the Findings of Fact, below. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer to all of the SOR \nallegations, her testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 52, is employed by a U.S. Government contractor as a quality \nsupervisor. Her 2018 SCA is her first application for a security clearance. She has worked \nfor this contractor continuously since 2007. In 1985, she earned a high school diploma in \nthe Philippines, where she was born. In 1993, she married a man who was also born in \nthe Philippines. Prior to their marriage, her husband had immigrated to the United States. \nHe sponsored her immigration visa, and she entered the United States in 1998. Applicant \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2005. They have three adult children. The two oldest were born \nin the Philippines, and the youngest was born in the United States. All three children are \nU.S. citizens. They are now grown, and live on their own without any support from their \nparents. (Tr. at 25, 31; GE 2 at 8.) \nApplicant and her husband have owned their home since 2012. Applicant\u2019s mother \nhas lived with them since 2008. Her mother was also born in the Philippines and \nimmigrated to the United States. She became a U.S. citizen in 2018 or 2019. Applicant \nhas a brother who resides with his wife and children in the Philippines. (Tr. at 75-77.) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant and her husband together earn about $164,000 per year. Neither of them \nincurred a job loss at any time in recent years. Applicant testified that her husband\u2019s \nincome in some years was less than usual, which is about $100,000 annually, due to \nchanges in his work schedule and loss of overtime. Her husband works for the U.S. \nmilitary overseas as a civilian. He is away from home much of the time. The couple largely \nkeep their finances separate with the exception of a joint savings account with a balance \nof about $9,000. (Tr. at 27-29, 31-32; 55.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that much of her financial problems were due to \nher overspending on her credit cards. She also had a child in college. These \ncircumstances caused some financial difficulties. The debts alleged in the SOR relate to \nher credit-card debts. In January 2016, Applicant obtained a loan in the amount of about \n$50,000 that she used to pay off some of her credit cards. In or about February 2017, she \ndefaulted in repaying this loan. The Government\u2019s credit report at that time also revealed \nthat she defaulted on eight credit-card accounts, which are listed in the SOR. All of the \ncredit cards are solely in her name. (GE 1 at 41-42, 43-49, 73; GE 3 at 4-5.) \nIn her January 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had consolidated her credit-\ncard debts with a debt-consolidation company. She wrote that her financial problems \nbegan in March 2017. She testified that she saw an advertisement on TV for a business \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat provided debt-consolidation services. She contacted the company and entered into \nan agreement with it. She understood the company would contact her creditors and pay \nthem out of funds she paid to the company. She stopped paying her creditors directly. \nShe subsequently realized that this debt-consolidation plan was a mistake because her \ncreditors continued to contact her and pressure her to pay her debts. She terminated her \ncontract with the company, and decided to pay her creditors directly. (Tr. at 32-34.) \nThe history and current status of Applicant\u2019s nine admitted debts listed in the SOR \nare as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, Credit-Card Account in the amount of $8,654. This account was opened in \n2011 and became delinquent in or about April 2017. The creditor has charged off this \ndebt and transferred this account to a collection agency. Applicant has made no payments \non this account since it became delinquent. She is hoping the creditor will contact her with \na settlement offer. She will then negotiate an affordable settlement. This debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. at 35-36; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 1 \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, Credit-Card Account in the amount of $5,938. This account was opened \nin July 2016 and became delinquent in or about March 2017. The creditor charged off this \naccount in September 2017. The creditor filed a lawsuit and obtained a garnishment of \nApplicant\u2019s wages. She presently owes about $217, and it will be fully paid off in the near \nfuture. This debt is being involuntarily resolved by a court-ordered garnishment. \n(Tr. at 36; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, Credit-Card Account in the amount of $5,767. This account was opened in \nDecember 2017 and became delinquent in or about May 2018. The creditor transferred \nthe account to a collection agency. Applicant testified that she spoke with the new creditor \nabout two weeks prior to the hearing. She is waiting to receive from the creditor a \nsettlement offer so that she can begin paying this debt. This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, Credit-Card Account in the amount of $4,204. The credit reports in the \nrecord do not list the date when this collection account was opened with the original credit-\ncard issuer. The reports reflect that the account became delinquent in or about February \n2017. Applicant recently received a settlement offer to pay $263 per month on a reduced \namount of about $3,100. She spoke with the creditor by phone two months ago and has \nmade one or two payments on the settlement. The Government\u2019s most recent credit \nreport in the record, dated October 22, 2020, reflects a balance due of $3,264, about $940 \nless than the original amount of the debt. After the hearing, Applicant provided AE A from \nthe creditor, which reflects a payment of $527 on or about October 21, 2020, and an \noutstanding balance of $2,636. The evidence suggests that she has made payments of \nabout $500 to $900 under this settlement. Her next payment of $236 was due on \nNovember 15, 2020. This debt is being resolved with a payment plan. (Tr. at 38-39; \nGE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; AE A.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, Credit-Card Account in the amount of $3,954.

Applicant testified that she has been paying $234 per month since \nMay or June 2020 under a payment plan to settle this debt in the amount of $3,264. She \nbelieves that she now owes about $1,600 on this account. Government Exhibit 6, dated \nOctober 22, 2020, reflects a balance due of $3,690. After the hearing, Applicant provided \nAE B from the creditor, which reflects a payment of $235 on October 27, 2020, and an \noutstanding balance due of $3,009. This debt is being resolved with a payment plan. \n(Tr. at 39-41; GE 4 at 2; GE 6 at 2; AE Y.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f, Credit-Card Account in the amount of $3,651. This account was opened in \nNovember 2002 and became delinquent in March 2017. The account has been charged \noff and transferred to a collection agency. Applicant claims that about two weeks prior to \nthe hearing, she accepted a settlement offer from the creditor in the amount of $1,700 to \nbe paid in its entirety or in unknown monthly amounts over time. She is waiting to receive \nconfirmation of the terms in the mail. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 42-43; GE 3 at \n5; GE 4 at 2; GE 6 at 5; AE Z.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, Loan Account in the amount of $49,431. This debt is the January 2016 \ndebt-consolidation loan in the amount of $50,000 that Applicant used to pay off some of \nher credit cards. She testified that she was experiencing financial difficulties in 2015. She \nresponded to an offer from a commercial lender of a credit-card consolidation loan to pay \noff her credit cards. The loan terms required that she pay $800 per month. Applicant \ntestified that the original amount of the loan was only $35,000. She could not explain how \nthe loan became $50,000, as the Government\u2019s credit report reflects. She defaulted on \nrepaying the loan about one year later. Applicant testified further that she has been \nrepaying this debt for the last two years under a payment plan that requires her to pay \n$600 per month for five years for a total amount of $39,000. She does not know the \namount of the current balance of this debt. She testified that she could provide emails \nafter the hearing to show \u201call the payments.\u201d She failed to produce any documentation \nsupporting her testimony regarding a payment plan or her payments thereunder. \nGovernment Exhibit 3 lists this debt as reported by Experian. The Government\u2019s three \nmore recent credit reports are from Equifax and do not reflect this debt. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence is insufficient to support a conclusion that this debt is being resolved. \n(Tr. at 43-47; GE 3 at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, Credit-Card Account in the amount of $3,636. Applicant opened this \naccount in December 2016. The account became delinquent in March 2017. The creditor \ncharged off the account in September 2017. She testified that she has not paid anything \non this account since then. In September 2020 she made an offer to the creditor to resolve \nthis debt with a payment of 30% of the balance. She is waiting to receive a response. She \nprovided no documentary evidence to support her testimony. This debt has not yet been \nresolved. (Tr. at 48-49; GE 3 at 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, Credit-Card Account in the amount of $3,147. Applicant opened this \naccount in December 2002. She became delinquent on this account in March 2017. The \naccount was charged off in the amount of $5,245 and was transferred to a collection \nagency. Applicant testified that this debt was settled in 2017 or 2018 by her debt-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsolidation company.

(Tr. at 64-65; GE 3 at 5; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 \nat 4.) \nIn addition to the above debts, Applicant has a credit-card account with a balance \nof about $21,856. The credit limit is $22,100. This account is current. Applicant pays about \n$438 per month to keep the account current. She no longer uses her credit cards as she \nonce did. She offered no evidence, however, that she has any credit cards with any \nunused credit. She admitted she used to shop excessively. Now she controls herself, and \nher spending has \u201cchanged a lot.\u201d In addition to her joint savings account with her \nhusband, she has a 401K retirement account with her employer with about $154,000 in \ninvestments. She was promoted to a supervisory position in 2020 and makes about \n$73,000 annually. Her \u201ctarget\u201d is to pay off her debts in 2021. (Tr. at 8, 55-57, 73-74). \nForeign Influence \nApplicant testified that her mother has lived in the United States with Applicant \nsince 2008 and is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. Her mother supports herself with Social \nSecurity Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. Applicant also testified that her brother \nis a laborer in the Philippines and has a wife and children. In the past, Applicant has \nhelped support her brother and his family with cash payments. She has also paid for the \ncost of educating her nephews and nieces. In the first ten months of 2020, she has given \nher brother about $400-$500. In the past, she has given him and his family as much as \n$1,200 in a year. Applicant talks with her brother on the phone about once per week. \nApplicant last traveled to the Philippines to visit her brother in 2016. She has a close \nrelationship with her brother. (Tr. at 59-63, 75-77.) \nThe Philippines \nThe U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution \nwhen traveling to the Philippines due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. The State \nDepartment advises that there is considerable risk of terrorism in the country. Terrorist \norganizations and criminal gangs operate throughout the country. Some groups are allied \nwith the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, also known as ISIS. The organizations and \ngangs conduct bombing attacks and kidnappings against foreigners, civilians, \ngovernment institutions, and security forces. \nThere are significant human rights problems in the Philippines, including unlawful \nand arbitrary killings by security forces, vigilantes, and insurgents. Other human rights \nconcerns \nraised \nby \nactions \nof \ngovernment \nrepresentatives \ninclude \nforced \ndisappearances, torture, arbitrary detention, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, \npolitical detentions, killings and threats against journalists, official corruption, and abuse \nof power. Law enforcement agencies are engaged in a nationwide counter-narcotics \ncampaign that has resulted in a sharp increase in violence between police and individuals \nsuspected of involvement in the drug trade. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR response and testimony, and the documentary \nevidence in the record, establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts, \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \nAG \u00b6 19(e): consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or \nirresponsible spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, \nor other negative financial indicators. \nApplicant has had significant financial issues for at least the past three years. She \nhas a history of spending on credit cards beyond her ability to pay her debts. Those facts \nare sufficient to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate them. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Four of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Some of her financial problems may have been \nthe result of her husband\u2019s temporary loss of income at some point in time. This would be \na reason beyond her control. She did not present evidence to show that her defaults on \nher debts occurred at times when her husband\u2019s income was reduced. Even if she had \nshown that the debts were caused by her husband\u2019s temporary loss of income, she has \nnot shown that she acted responsibly under the circumstances by reducing her credit-\ncard spending at such times.  \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant sought counseling and assistance \nfrom the credit-consolidation company, but terminated the agreement when she learned \nthat the company had made excessive promises it did not keep. In the weeks and months \nbefore the hearing, Applicant has made some efforts to resolve two of her debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.e), but those efforts are insufficient to demonstrate that her financial problems \nare being resolved.  \n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent and frequent. She \ncurrently has unresolved, credit-card debts totaling $21,708 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, and \n1.h) and a bank loan of about $50,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), for which she provided no \ndocumentary evidence of any payments or a payment plan. These debts occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur and cast doubt upon her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. The key requirement of this mitigating condition is a \nshowing of a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to repay creditors. Applicant resolved one debt in good \nfaith through her debt-consolidation company. (SOR \u00b6 1.i) Her payment of a debt pursuant \nto a garnishment (SOR \u00b6 1.b), however, does not qualify as being made in good faith \nbecause the payments were involuntary. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s last-minute attempts to set \nup payment plans just before the hearing (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) when her application for \na security clearance was pending adjudication does not show a good-faith effort to resolve \nher debts. Applicant offered no explanation why she did not start to resolve her debts \nshortly after they became delinquent, largely in 2017, or at least after she submitted her \nSCA in January 2018. Applicant\u2019s most significant debt, her $50,000 debt-consolidation \nloan, had no apparent effect of reducing her credit-card debt. Moreover, she claims that \nshe has been paying this debt every month for about two years. When given the \nopportunity after the hearing to provide documentation to substantiate this claim, she \nfailed to do so, even though she provided documentation (AE A and B) showing recent, \nsmall payments on two minor debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). The absence of supporting \ndocumentation on her large loan strongly suggests that Applicant was unable to provide \ncritical evidence to back up her testimony on her most significant debt. \nOverall, Applicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by her past misuse \nof credit cards by taking significant, responsible steps to repay her creditors. Paragraph \n1 is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6, as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR response and testimony, and the documentary \nevidence in the record, establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 8 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Three of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nThe findings above regarding the country conditions in the Philippines support a \nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s brother in the Philippines creates a heightened risk and raises \nsecurity concerns. I cannot conclude under AG \u00b6 8(a) that it is unlikely that Applicant will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of her brother and the \ninterests of the United States. The fact that Applicant\u2019s brother is a laborer reduces that \nrisk significantly, but it does not eliminate the risk. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) has been fully established. Although Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty and \nobligation to her brother cannot be characterized as minimal, she has established that \nshe has deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. Her \nhusband and three children are U.S. citizens and residents. Both she and her husband \nwork to support the U.S. military and earn a significant combined income. They own a \nhome in the United States, and they raised and educated their children in this country. \nShe has been a U.S. resident since 1998 and a U.S. citizen since 2005. She brought her \nmother from the Philippines to live with her in the United States in 2008. Her mother is \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnow a U.S citizen and is supported by U.S. Government benefits. Applicant has a \nsignificant investment in her 401K retirement fund. As a result of these deep ties to this \ncountry, she can be expected to resolve any conflicts of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. She has mitigated all security concerns raised by her relationship with her \nbrother, a citizen and resident of the Philippines. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s relationship with her brother is close and \nshe has weekly conversations with him and his family by telephone. These facts do not \nsupport a conclusion that those contacts are so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that the contact and communications could create a risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s has established that her circumstances fully mitigate security \nconcerns under Guideline B. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and B in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has not established \nthat she has made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts or that future indebtedness is \nunlikely to recur. She has established that her brother\u2019s citizenship and residency in the \nPhilippines does not create a potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude that while Applicant has mitigated security \nconcerns raised by her foreign contacts, she has not mitigated security concerns raised \nby her indebtedness. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

She is 34 years old, single, and \nhas a minor child. (Tr. at 87; GE 1) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2005. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2011 and a master\u2019s degree in 2020. She worked as an administrative assistant for a \nstate government until February 2011, when funding for her position ceased and she \nwas unemployed until January 2012.

(Tr. at 5-6, 38-40, 72-73, 97-99, 115; GE 1, 2; AE O) \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent consumer debts totaling $29,674 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.h) and two delinquent medical debts totaling $1,141 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.i). \nThe debts are established by credit reports from 2018, 2019, and 2020. She also \ndiscussed them during her 2019 background interview. The SOR also alleges that \nApplicant falsified her November 2018 security clearance application (SCA) by \ndeliberately failing to disclose, in response to section 26, her delinquent debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.i. (GE 1-5; AE A) \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to her youth, financial illiteracy, and \nlimited income. She earned between $45,000 and $52,000 from 2012 to 2014, and \n$65,000 to $68,000 from 2014 to 2018. She started regaining control of her finances in \n2016. As of the date of the hearing, she paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i \nand she was in the process of resolving SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.h. (Answer; Tr. at 37-103, \n115-122; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $15,630 charged-off auto account for a car Applicant bought in \n2008 and timely paid until the car was stolen in 2013. She bought another car believing \nthe account for the stolen car would be written off as a total loss. The stolen car was \nfound shortly thereafter and she became delinquent on the account for the stolen car \nbecause she could not afford to pay for two cars. A lien was placed against her. She \nremained in contact with the creditor and made minimal payments that she could afford. \nShe received approximately $45,000 from her father\u2019s estate in September 2019, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $4,533 charged-off furniture rental account for a bedroom set \nApplicant rented in 2014, with the expectation that she would eventually own it. She \nmade 10 to 11 payments of approximately $128 monthly. She returned the furniture in \n2015 after several pieces broke, and she assumed she was no longer required to pay \nthe account. She did not learn about the delinquency until an unrecalled date when it \nappeared on her credit report. She obtained a store return receipt in January 2020 and \nbelieved she no longer had an outstanding balance. Her efforts to verify her zero \nbalance with the store were unsuccessful, due to the store\u2019s limited hours as a result of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. She intends to continue to contact the store to verify that this \naccount is resolved; if she has an outstanding balance, she intends to pay it. (Tr. at 43-\n50, 106-109; GE 4; AE A, B, E, U) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $724 dental bill in collection. Applicant believed her health \ninsurance paid for this bill. She did not learn that it was outstanding until after she \nreceived the SOR. She called the dentist\u2019s office and was told that the bill was due to a \nsubmitting code error. After the dentist\u2019s office resubmitted the bill with the proper code, \nher insurance paid the outstanding balance. She disputed this debt in June 2020 \nbecause she believed it was paid. Her credit report from August 2020 reflects that the \naccount has a zero balance. (Tr. at 50-52, 110, 115; AE A, B) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a $544 charged-off credit card. Applicant became delinquent \ndue to her limited income. She contacted the creditor in 2017 to try to resolve it and the \ncreditor offered to transfer her outstanding balance to another credit card.

(Answer; Tr. at 16-37, 39-40, 94-; GE 1; AE S, T) \nPolicies \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under \nher circumstances. She began to regain control of her finances in 2016. She enrolled in \na credit counseling program in August 2019, before she received the SOR. She paid \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i and she was in the process of resolving SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.h. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe guideline notes the following potentially applicable condition that could raise \ntrustworthiness concerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor at hearing, and find that she credibly testified \nthat she misunderstood section 26 of her SCA. She did not deliberately omit her \ndelinquent debts, as she believed she was only required to list them if they stemmed \nfrom gambling, drug use, alcoholism, and other illegal activities. She discussed her \ndelinquent debts during her subsequent background interview. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

(Tr. 33) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial problems developed over several years, and coincided \nwith the unexpected birth of triplets in 1998, his wife\u2019s disabling back injury in 2002, and \nseveral years of unemployment or underemployment in the 2010s. Applicant\u2019s employer \nthat laid him off in 2013 re-hired him in 2018. Applicant has been working for this employer \ncontinuously since then. This steady employment coincided with an improved financial \noutlook. By March 2021, Applicant had satisfied the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.b \nand 1.c, and by June 2021, he had negotiated a payment plan to satisfy the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.a. He has made two payments, consistent with the plan. \nApplicant maintains a budget and has ample discretionary income. In that two of his \nchildren are partially independent and his wife is working both a full-time and a part-time \njob, he no longer has the amount of financial demands that he had when he was laid off in \n2013. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nUnder these circumstances, the following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUpon considering this case in the context of the whole-person concept, particularly \nwith respect to the surrounding circumstances, the presence of rehabilitation, and the \nminimal likelihood of recurrence, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Criminal History Assault Arrests Applicant, 43, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting company since April 2018. He completed a security clearance application, his first, in May 2018, disclosing derogatory information about his criminal history and past use of illegal drugs. The ensuing investigation revealed that Applicant has been arrested nine times between 2007 and 2019; that he attended a court-ordered substance-abuse program in April 2018; and that he is currently on unsupervised probation until April 2021. The investigation also revealed that he continued using illegal drugs after completing his 2017 security clearance application and while participating in a substance-abuse program. Applicant was charged with assault twice in July 2011. On the first occasion, he was charged with first-degree assault after an altercation with the tenant renting his 3 basement. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 5.a) The charge was not prosecuted. Days later, Applicant was arrested and charged with second-degree assault (SOR \u00b61.h, 5.a).

Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his history of illegal drug use, alcohol abuse, \nand resulting criminal history. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 11, 2019, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the criminal conduct, drug involvement and substance misuse, \nalcohol consumption, and financial consideration guidelines. The Agency acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. \nBased on the available information, DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and \nrecommended that the case be submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(DOHA) administrative judge to determine whether to grant or deny his security \nclearance. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing.

He provided his written response on September 27, 2020. \n(HE II) He did not object to the amendments. Accordingly, the SOR is amended as \nfollows: \n1. The Government amended the criminal conduct guideline to add four allegations: \n1.g. In June 2007, Applicant was charged with an open container violation that \nwas nolle prossed; \n1.h. In July 2011, Applicant was charged with assault. He was convicted. \n1.i. In January 2019, Applicant was charged with speeding. He pleaded guilty \nand received one year of probation before judgment beginning April 2019; and \n1.j. In May 2019, Applicant was charged with speeding. He pleaded guilty and \nreceived six months of probation before judgment beginning July 2019. \nApplicant admitted each allegation. \n2. The Government amended the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline to add two allegations: \nApplicant used cocaine on various occasions between January 2000 and \nAugust 2018, not August 2017 as alleged in the December 2019 SOR; and \n2.c. Applicant tested positive for cocaine in August 2018 while participating in a \ncourt-ordered substance-abuse program. \n2 \n 2.a. \n\nApplicant admitted each allegation. \n3. The Government amended the alcohol consumption guideline to add two \nallegations: \n3.b. Applicant tested positive for alcohol in July 2018 while participating in a \ncourt-ordered substance-abuse treatment program; and \n3.c. In June 2007, Applicant was charged with an open container violation that \nwas nolle prossed. \nApplicant admitted each allegation. \n4. The Government withdrew all allegations under the financial considerations \nguideline. \n5. The Government amended the SOR to add concerns under the personal conduct \nguideline, specifically: \n5.a. The conduct alleged under the criminal conduct guideline (1.a \u2013 1.j), and the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse (2.a \u2013 2.c) guideline; and \n5.b. Applicant deliberately falsified his September 2019 responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories when he reported that he last used cocaine in August 2017, not \nAugust 2018. \nApplicant admitted each allegation. \nFindings of Fact \nCriminal History \nAssault Arrests \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant, 43, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting \ncompany since April 2018.

The details of the \nincident are unclear from the record, but he was convicted and sentenced to probation \nbefore judgment for one year. (Tr. 64-65; GE 2, 9, 11, 67) \nThe SOR also alleges two arrests stemming from Applicant\u2019s interactions with his \nex-wife, to whom he was married from 2007 to 2011. Applicant maintains contact with \nher because they share custody of their two minor children. Applicant was arrested in \nAugust 2011, and charged with assault on a family member (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 5.a). \nAccording to the police report, Applicant punched his ex-wife on the forehead during an \naltercation between him, his ex-wife, and his then girlfriend, who is the mother of \nApplicant\u2019s third child. The fight occurred when Applicant picked up the children from his \nex-wife\u2019s home for his scheduled visitation. Applicant testified that the police report was \nincorrect. According to Applicant, his girlfriend admitted to the responding officers that \nshe assaulted Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. Applicant maintains that the police officer chose \ninstead to believe his ex-wife\u2019s accusations against him, which were corroborated by \nher parents who witnessed the altercation. Applicant entered an Alford plea on the \nassault charge; however, his sentence is unclear from the record. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife \nobtained a protective order in September 2011, requiring him to stay a minimum of \n5,000 feet away from her and prohibiting him from having any contact with her. The \ncourt also ordered the couple to execute visitation through a supervised exchange \nprogram.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b61.d, \n5.a) The court determined that Applicant violated the protective order and extended it to \nMarch 2017. Applicant described his relationship with his ex-wife as contentious. He \ntestified that she tried, without success, to have the protection order extended on at \nleast four other occasions.

However, in the September 2018 subject \ninterview, Applicant told the investigator that he intentionally hid the item in his shopping \ncart to avoid paying for it. Applicant adopted the contents of the subject interview in his \nSeptember 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories. Although Applicant made some \ncorrections to the subject interview summary, he did not make any corrections to the \nparagraph recounting the incidents of the October 2016 arrest. Applicant pleaded guilty \nto theft less than $100. (Tr.57-58; Answer; GE 1-2, 6) \n4 \n\n \nAlcohol and Drug Related Arrests \nBetween 2007 and 2018, Applicant was arrested three times for conduct related \nto alcohol or illegal drug use. In June 2007, Applicant was charged with having an open \ncontainer of alcohol in a parking lot where he was socializing with his friends. The \ncharge was not prosecuted. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 3.c, 5.a) In August 2017, Applicant was \ncharged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) on cocaine, after he fell asleep while \ndriving and hit a street sign. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.b, 5.a). At the hearing, Applicant stated that \nthe night of the accident, he took Xanax, not cocaine. Although Applicant admits that the \nblood test administered after the accident tested positive for cocaine, he maintains that \nhe used the drug the weekend before the accident, which occurred on a Sunday. The \ncourt found Applicant guilty of DWI \u2013 first offense. The court restricted Applicant\u2019s \ndriving privileges for 12 months, ordered him to attend a substance-abuse program, and \nrequired the installation an interlock device on his vehicle. The court also placed \nApplicant on unsupervised probation for three years to end in April 2021. (Tr. 53-57, 66, \n84-85; GE 1, 2, 5, 10; AE B-C) \nFifteen months later, Applicant was cited for DWI - alcohol while transporting a \nminor, his daughter, and exceeding the speed limit. (SOR \u00b6 1.a, 3.a, 5.a) The traffic \nstop occurred at 1:30 a.m. At the hearing, Applicant explained that the night before he \nwas stopped, he consumed alcohol at a friend\u2019s home. He took a nap before driving \nhome with his daughter and girlfriend, the child\u2019s mother. Applicant explained that while \nhe slept, his girlfriend continued to drink. Applicant believed that the alcohol the officer \nsmelled in the vehicle emanated from his girlfriend and not him. Applicant passed the \nfield sobriety tests, but refused to take a breathalyzer test. The court found Applicant not \nguilty on the DWI-alcohol charge and dismissed the related charge regarding the \ntransportation of a minor while impaired. The court convicted Applicant of speeding for \ndriving 81 miles per hour (mph) in a 55 mph zone.

(Tr. 72-73; GE 12-13) \nAlcohol and Substance Abuse History \nDuring the background investigation and at hearing, Applicant discussed his \nhistory of alcohol and illegal drug use. During his twenties, Applicant consumed alcohol \nfive times per week. Although he drank heavily, his drinking did not adversely impact his \nlife. During his marriage from 2007 to 2011, Applicant testified that his alcohol \nconsumption decreased to three nights per week, but that he was regularly drinking to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintoxication. He testified that his drinking habits changed significantly after the 2017 \nDWI. He now consumes alcohol on average twice per month. (Tr. 89-95) \nApplicant reported that he first used cocaine in January 2000. He purchased the \ndrug from an acquaintance and used it recreationally without issue until his August 2017 \ncar accident and resulting DWI conviction. As a result of his arrest and subsequent \ndetainment, Applicant failed to report to work and lost his job. Applicant explained \nduring his July 2018 subject interview that his cocaine use adversely effected his ability \nto sleep and interfered with his ability to take care of his family. Applicant reported \nduring his subject interview and in his September 2019 response to DOHA \ninterrogatories that he last used cocaine in August 2017. In both statements, Applicant \nstated that he had no intention of using the drug in the future because doing so was \nincompatible with his personal and professional responsibilities. (Tr. 37-38, 85; GE 1-2, \n5) \nAs part of his sentence for the 2017 DWI conviction, Applicant was ordered to \nparticipate in a substance-abuse program, which he did from April to September 2018. \nAt each session, Applicant submitted to urinalysis. According to the program provider\u2019s \nreport, Applicant tested positive for alcohol in July 2018. (SOR \u00b6 3.b) Five weeks later, \nin August 2018, more than 12 weeks into the program, he tested positive for cocaine. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.c) Applicant admitted that he continued to use alcohol even though he was \nordered by the court to abstain. He denied using cocaine during the program, testifying \nthat the counselor alerted him to the positive urinalysis result, but told Applicant that the \nresult was inconclusive. The treatment record does not support this statement, but it \ndoes not appear that Applicant experienced any repercussions from the court for the \npositive urinalysis results. According to the treatment record, Applicant completed the \n20-hour substance abuse program as required, participating in 15 group sessions, and \n5 individual counseling session. The treatment notes do not contain a diagnosis or a \nprognosis. Applicant does not participate in any sobriety management program. (Tr. 38-\n39, 73; Answer) \nDespite the program notes establishing that Applicant tested positive for cocaine \nuse in August 2018, he maintains that he has not used cocaine since his DWI arrest in \nAugust 2017. He believes that he accurately reported his illegal drug use on his security \nclearance application and in response to DOHA interrogatories. When asked why he \nadmitted the amended SOR \u00b6 2.a that he used cocaine from 2007 until August 2018, he \ntestified that he did so on the advice of counsel. (SOR \u00b6 5.b) (Tr. 38-39, 73; GE 2; \nAnswer) \nApplicant testified that his difficult past is behind him. He has developed better \nand less contentious relationships with his children\u2019s mothers. Applicant also attributed \nhis lifestyle change to moving to another town. He began attending church in \nSeptember 2018 and is now in a relationship with another parishioner. Most of his \nfriends are people he met through church. When he is not working, Applicant spends his \nfree time with his daughter, age eight, of whom he shares custody. He also spends time \nexercising and participating in church activities. Applicant\u2019s current girlfriend describes \nhim as the \u201cmost responsible person she knows.\u201d Applicant\u2019s supervisor described \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant as trustworthy and reliable. Both recommended Applicant for eligibility for \naccess to classified information. (Tr. 18-30, 33-35, 43-45, 95-96, 98-103) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the criminal conduct, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct \nguidelines. The government has established a prima facie case under each. \nCriminal Conduct \nAn individual\u2019s criminal conduct creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, criminal conduct also calls into \nquestions a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations. \n(AG \u00b6 30). The record establishes that Applicant has a history of criminal conduct, \nranging from minor infractions, such as speeding, to more serious crimes, such as \nassault and driving while intoxicated. Applicant\u2019s conduct has resulted in two \nunprosecuted cases, one acquittal, one dismissed charge, and seven convictions. As a \nresult of a conviction on a 2017 DWI charge, Applicant is on unsupervised probation \nuntil April 2021. Accordingly, the following criminal conduct disqualifying conditions \napply: \nAG \u00b6 31(b) Evidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and, \nAG \u00b6 31(c) The individual is currently on parole or probation. \nNone of the criminal conduct mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a long \nand recent history of criminal conduct that shows a disregard for rules and regulations, \neven while under court supervision. Applicant\u2019s criminal history continues to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . that cause physical or mental \nimpairment . . . raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because \nit raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). Applicant admits to a history of recreational cocaine use, \nfrom 2007 to 2017. However, the record establishes that he continued to use cocaine \nuntil at least August 2018, when he tested positive for the drug while participating in a \ncourt-ordered substance-abuse program. Applicant\u2019s conduct requires the application of \nthe following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) Any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25 (b) Testing positive for an illegal drug. \nNone of the relevant mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s last use of cocaine \noccurred less than three years ago. He continued to use the drug after his 2017 DWI \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconviction and sentencing, and during the present security clearance adjudication. \nApplicant used cocaine one month after his July 2018 subject interview in which he \nacknowledged the negative consequences and promised that he would not use illegal \ndrugs in the future. These choices continue to reflect negatively on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. His decision to use illegal drugs while under court-\nsupervision and while participating in a court-ordered substance abuse program also \nindicates an unwillingness to abide by laws, rules, and regulations. \nThese concerns are not mitigated by Applicant\u2019s satisfactorily completion of the \ncourt-ordered substance-abuse program. Applicant presented no evidence of a \nfavorable diagnosis and prognosis. Neither are the concerns mitigated by the lifestyle \nchanges he has made to support sobriety. These actions are recent and have not been \nin effect long enough to establish their effectiveness, or to overcome his long history of \nillegal drug use and subsequent poor decisions. \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21) The record establishes the three alcohol-\nrelated events alleged in the SOR: that applicant was arrested for DWI \u2013 alcohol in \nNovember 2018; that he was charged with having an open container of alcohol in 2007; \nand that he tested positive for alcohol during a court-ordered substance abuse program \nin August 2018. The following disqualifying conditions apply: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) Alcohol-related incidents away from work . . . regardless of the \nfrequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has \nbeen diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(g) Failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \nThe 2007 and 2018 charges, while disqualifying, do not negatively reflect on \nApplicant\u2019s current security worthiness. Both incidents were nolle prossed. The 2007 \nincident was a minor violation. Based on the information in the record, it is not clear that \nApplicant was actually driving under the influence of alcohol, leading the court to \ndismiss that particular charge. These allegations merit the application of: \nAG \u00b6 23(a) So much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur, or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. \nHowever, this does not mitigate the overall security concerns regarding \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of alcohol. Applicant\u2019s continued use of alcohol while participating in \na court-ordered substance abuse program that required abstinence, continues to cast \ndoubt on his current security worthiness. This conduct is not mitigated because he did \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot face any legal consequences for his actions. Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior is \nanother example of his intentional disregard for the court-imposed orders and \nrestrictions. \nPersonal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring national security investigative or adjudicative processes. (AG \u00b6 15) \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories by intentionally failing to disclose his August 2018 cocaine use. Applicant \ndenies the allegation, maintaining that he last used cocaine in August 2017. However, \nthe program treatment notes clearly state that his urinalysis tested positive for cocaine \nin August 2018. Applicant did not provide a credible explanation for the discrepancy. \nApplicant agrees that the treatment notes are otherwise accurate. There is nothing in \nthe record to suggest that the notation regarding Applicant\u2019s cocaine use was a mistake. \nThe fact that the program director chose not to report Applicant\u2019s positive urinalysis to \nthe court does not mean that his drug use did not occur. Based on the information in the \nrecord, I find that Applicant intentionally falsified his answer to the DOHA \ninterrogatories. The evidence supports the application of the following personal conduct \ndisqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe Government cross-alleges under the personal conduct guideline, all of the \nconduct alleged under the criminal conduct, drug involvement and substance misuse, \nand alcohol consumption guidelines. Applicant\u2019s conduct is independently disqualifying \nunder each of the alleged adjudicative guidelines; however, when considered in its \ntotality, Applicant\u2019s conduct establishes a negative whole-person assessment that \nshows a history of questionable judgment, unreliability, untrustworthiness, lack of \ncandor, and unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations that indicate the \nhe may not properly safeguard or classified or sensitive information. \nThis negative whole-person assessment is not mitigated by Applicant\u2019s favorable \nreputation at work or the other good character information in the record. Security \nclearance decisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during \nduty hours; off-duty conduct can be considered in evaluating an applicant's security \neligibility. (Appeal Board Decision in ISCR 99-0068 (November 30, 1999)) In his \npersonal life, Applicant has repeatedly engaged in conduct that shows a disregard for \nthe law: illegal drug use, driving a car while under the influence of cocaine, theft, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nviolation of a protective order, and continued drug and alcohol use while participating in \ncourt-ordered substance abuse treatment. Applicant continued to engage in unlawful \nconduct while on unsupervised probation and after making promises to the government \nthat he would not do so in the future. None of the personal conduct mitigating conditions \napply. \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current \nsecurity worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but \nrather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that \nperson's past conduct and present circumstances. (Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528-29 (1988.)  Applicant\u2019s conduct establishes that he will not modify his \nbehavior to conform to the law or to existing court orders. Furthermore, his inability to \nhonor his own promise to abstain from illegal drug use suggests that he has difficulty \nwith self-regulation or that he has a blatant disregard for rules and regulations. \nAccordingly, Applicant lacks the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required \nof those granted access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Alcohol Consumption \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.c \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Financial Considerations \nWITHDRAWN \nParagraph 5, Personal Conduct \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 5.a \u2013 5.b \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 40-year-old subject-matter expert who installs communications upgrades on ships. He has been employed by a federal contractor since July 2004. He received a security clearance in July 2007. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1998 to December 2000 and received an honorable discharge. Applicant married in October 2000, separated in December 2013, and divorced around 2018. (Tr. 15.) He has lived with a cohabitant since March 2015. He has two children, ages 22 and 15, who live with their mother. (GX 1 at 16, 19-20.) The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling about $26,000, including the $71 medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which was withdrawn. The debts are reflected in credit reports from April 2017 (GX 2), April 2019 (GX 3), and April 2021 (GX 4). The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. SOR \u00b6 1.a: car lease charged off for $17,410. This debt was incurred when Applicant terminated a car lease early. (Tr. 53-54.) The April 2019 credit report reflects that the account was opened in May 2014, became delinquent in January 2017, and was paid off in February 2020. (GX 4 at 5.)

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on December 5, 2016. On \nDecember 16, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 11, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

Applicant testified but did \nnot submit any documentary evidence or present the testimony of any other witnesses. I \nkept the record open until May 11, 2021, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. \nAt his request, I extended the deadline for submitting additional evidence to May 31, 2021. \nHe timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted without \nobjection.

I granted the motion. (Tr. 7-8.) \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old subject-matter expert who installs communications \nupgrades on ships. He has been employed by a federal contractor since July 2004. He \nreceived a security clearance in July 2007. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy \nfrom October 1998 to December 2000 and received an honorable discharge. \n \n \nApplicant married in October 2000, separated in December 2013, and divorced \naround 2018. (Tr. 15.) He has lived with a cohabitant since March 2015. He has two \nchildren, ages 22 and 15, who live with their mother. (GX 1 at 16, 19-20.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling about $26,000, including the $71 \nmedical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which was withdrawn. The debts are reflected in credit reports \nfrom April 2017 (GX 2), April 2019 (GX 3), and April 2021 (GX 4). The evidence \nconcerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: car lease charged off for $17,410. This debt was incurred when \nApplicant terminated a car lease early. (Tr. 53-54.) The April 2019 credit report reflects \nthat the account was opened in May 2014, became delinquent in January 2017, and was \npaid off in February 2020. (GX 4 at 5.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $9,300.

The debt is not reflected in the April 2021 credit report. \n(GX 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: utility bill placed for collection of $36. Applicant testified that he paid \nthis debt. (Tr. 41.) The debt is reflected in the April 2019 credit report but not reflected in \nthe April 2021 credit report. (GX 3 at 2; GX 4.) Applicant continues to receive utilities from \nthe same provider. His most recent bill reflects that the account is current. (AX D.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: cellphone bill placed for collection of $79. Applicant testified that he \npaid this debt. It is reflected in the April 2017 credit report, but it is not reflected in the \ncredit reports from April 2019 or April 2021. Applicant testified that he still has service with \nthe same provider, and his monthly statement reflects that the account is current. (AX C; \nTr. 50.) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to a lengthy marital breakup over a period \nof about four years. He testified that he paid a divorce lawyer about $4,000 in 2015, and \nthe lawyer disappeared after taking his money. (Tr. 15, 32.) He and his wife owned two \nhomes, living in one and renting the other. When they separated, Applicant was working \noverseas, and his wife moved out of the former family home. They began renting both \nhomes and had difficulty paying two mortgages when their tenants failed to pay their rent. \n(Tr. 29-30.) Applicant was able to dispose of both properties by short sales around 2017 \nand avoid any delinquencies related to them. (Tr. 31.) \nApplicant has not sought or received financial counseling. (Tr. 47-48.) Regarding \nthe debts alleged in the SOR, he testified that he \u201cbuckled down,\u201d saved as much money \nas he could, worked as many hours as possible, and was able to resolve all his delinquent \ndebts. (Tr. 37-38.) He testified that he is working on reducing his financial obligations and \nhas paid down the balance on a credit card (not alleged in the SOR) by about $6,000. (Tr. \n13.) The April 2021 credit report reflects a credit-card account with a credit limit of \n$22,000; a balance of $15,233; and monthly payments of $308, which are current. (GX 4 \nat 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay is about $6,000 per month. He has invested about \n$3,000 in cryptocurrency. He has an average of about $2,000 in his checking account. \nHe rents his home for $1,700 per month, including utilities. He owns one vehicle, a high-\nperformance car that he bought to indulge his hobby of competitive driving. He bought it \nafter resolving the debts associated with his divorce. He and his 15-year-old son spend \ntime together watching car races, motocross bikes, and rally cars. (Tr. 23-24.) The April \n2021 credit report reflects that he borrowed $50,651 in May 2020; his monthly payments \nare $859; the balance is $44,745; and the payments are current. (GX 4 at 2.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by \nknown sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result \nfrom criminal activity, including espionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant admitted the $170 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he was unable \nto identify it at the hearing. The SOR and the credit report on which it was based do not \nset out an account number, the name of a medical provider, the date it was incurred or \nreferred for collection, the name of a collection agency, or any other information \nidentifying the debt. SOR \u00b6 1.c falls short of the specificity required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3, \nwhich is intended to enable an applicant to respond an SOR. I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.c \nfor Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing constitute \nsubstantial evidence sufficient to establish SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f and raise two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The evidence regarding SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f is sparse. SOR \u00b6 1.e is reflected only in the April 2019 credit report, and \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is reflected only in the April 2107 credit report. Applicant continues to receive \nservice from the providers alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, and his billing statements from \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nboth providers show that the accounts are current. The fact that they are not reflected in \nthe April 2019 credit report tends to support his testimony that they were paid, because \nthey are too recent to have \u201caged off\u201d his credit record under the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct. In any event, the amounts of these two debts are too small to have security \nsignificance. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, numerous, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s marital breakup, the failure of his tenants to \ntimely pay their rent, and the thievery by a divorce attorney were circumstances largely \nbeyond his control. He acted responsibly by selling the rental properties and paying or \nsettling his debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant resolved the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, totaling $26,710. He submitted circumstantial evidence that the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, totaling only $115, were resolved. He has a credit-card \naccount and a car loan, both of which are current. An applicant is not required to be debt-\nfree. An applicant is required to act responsibly under the circumstances and develop a \nreasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d evidencing a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan. ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017).

Applicant was candid, sincere, and \ncredible at the hearing. He has worked as a federal contractor since 2004 and held a \nsecurity clearance since 2007, apparently without incident. His history of financial \ndelinquency did not begin until his marriage fell apart in 2013. He has gained control of \nhis financial situation. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

The Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on \nNovember 25, 2019, detailing national security concerns under Guideline I (Psychological Considerations). The DoD \nCAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), \nas amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective within DoD  on June 8, 2017. \n \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in writing in an answer, dated February 11, 2020, in which \nhe admitted parts of the Government\u2019s allegations with detailed explanations and denied other parts. (Answer). He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nNovember 12, 2020, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 16, 2021, \nscheduling the hearing for March 10, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented three proposed exhibits, marked \nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. I marked Department Counsel\u2019s March 20, 2020 discovery letter, \nwhich lists the Government\u2019s exhibits, as Hearing Exhibit I. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Government offered a \nfourth exhibit, marked GE 4. (Tr. at 8, 77.) \nApplicant\u2019s counsel introduced a number of exhibits at the hearing, which she designated as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through G. She also provided a substitute Exhibit List, which I marked as Hearing Exhibit II. She \nrequested that I keep the record open until March 24, 2021, to give her the opportunity to submit additional exhibits. I \napproved her request. Applicant\u2019s counsel emailed three exhibits on March 24, 2021 (Hearing Exhibit III) and the \nrecord closed. She identified the supplemental exhibits as AE H, I, and J. In the absence of any objections, I admitted \nall of the exhibits of both parties into the record. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 19, 2021.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his \nAnswer, his testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old and married in 2016. He and his wife have no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s of \nscience degree in 2011. He is currently enrolled in a master\u2019s program, which is scheduled to finish in the fall of 2022. \nHe and a friend co-founded a business that serves as a subcontractor for a U.S. Government contractor. (Tr. at 11-14.) \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s graduation in 2011, his employer at the time sponsored him to apply for a security \nclearance. He was granted an interim secret clearance while his application was pending. The DoD CAF required that \nApplicant provide written answers and documents in response to interrogatories relating to his past treatment for \nmental-health disorders.

(Tr. at 15-17.) \nJune \n \n2019 \n \nMental \n \nHealth Evaluation \n \n \nIn May 2016, Applicant reapplied for a clearance. In March 2019, the DoD CAF requested that Applicant voluntarily \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipate in an independent psychological\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevaluation. He agreed to do so, and on June 20, 2019, a licensed clinical psychologist \n(the LCP) conducted an evaluation. The next day, she prepared a nine-page summary of \nher psychological evaluation (June 2019 Report) and attached her eight-page CV, to \nestablish her credentials. \nThe LCP concluded that Applicant\u2019s diagnostic profile is the following: \u201cBipolar II \nDisorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n(predominantly inattentive type), Alcohol Use Disorder (in sustained remission), Cannabis \nUse Disorder (in sustained remission), and Nonadherence to Medical Treatment (by \nhistory).\u201d She noted that he continues to experience anxiety daily. She wrote that \u201cthe risk \nof future mood disturbance seems moderate\u201d and that \u201cit can be mitigated through \ntreatment compliance\u201d and other ongoing efforts. She concluded, however, that: \n[Applicant] currently presents with several conditions and a behavioral \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth history that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand/or trustworthiness concerning classified information. Although \n \n \n \n \n[Applicant]\nreported \nhaving \n\u201cvery\ngood \njudgment \nunder \nmost \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances,\u201d he continues to struggle with behavioral and emotional \n \nregulation on a daily basis. Furthermore, questionable treatment \n \n \n \ncompliance points to a guarded prognosis. \nSOR Allegations \n \nThe SOR contains the following three allegations: \n1.a. Mental-health treatment in 2004 at an addiction and recovery facility. \n \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Attention Deficit Disorder. SOR \u00b6 1.a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalso alleges that he missed appointments and failed to follow his treatment plan. \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn his Answer, Applicant denies that this allegation is factually correct. He was \ntreated for substance abuse at the identified facility in 2004 when he was 19 years old. \nHe claims he was never diagnosed with any mental disorders during his treatment for \naddiction. (Answer at 3-4.) \nApplicant testified at the hearing that at that time, he was self-medicating his \ndepression and anxiety with marijuana and alcohol. His father encouraged him to seek \nhelp, and Applicant attended 12 weekly group sessions on an out-patient basis at the \naddiction recovery facility identified in the SOR. Applicant also received medication. The \nfacility did not provide mental-health services and provided no diagnosis of his mental-\nhealth condition. He clarified that when he was 18 he was hospitalized for two weeks and \nreceived a formal mental-health diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder. (See discussion under \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, below.) At that time, he was also suffering from a serious problem with suicidal \nideation. A few years earlier, when he was 14 or 15, he was diagnosed with depression. \nApplicant has established that this allegation in the SOR identified the wrong facility, but \nis otherwise correct. (Tr. at 22-24, 45, 54-55, 64, 75.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that after his substance-abuse treatment, he did not fully comply with his \nmental health treatment plan, which was established in the earlier 2003 to 2004 period. In January 2005, \nhe ceased all treatment and medication. At the time of his 2019 Government-requested psychological \nevaluation and at the hearing, Applicant attributed his decision to a number of factors, but primarily to a \n \n \n \n \n \nlack of maturity. He did not understand the importance of his treatment and the positive impact that \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntreatment had on his life. (Tr. at 22-24, 56-57; GE 2 at 4.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.b. Treatment at a mental-health facility from December 2003 to January 2005. A licensed \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nsocial worker diagnosed Applicant as suffering from Bipolar II Disorder and Chronic Mood Disorder. In \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nJanuary 2005, he stopped his treatment and refused any further treatment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation based upon the same facts discussed above. \n \n \n \n \n \nHe attributed his failure to adhere to treatment recommendations to his lack of maturity at a time when he \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nwas 18-20 years old. He provided additional reasons for his behavior. Initially, he was pressured to \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelocate to the native country of his then-girlfriend. He moved with her and lived there for about one year. \n \n \nHe returned to the United States and attended college. He wrote that he could not study while being \n \nmedicated for anxiety. He ultimately graduated from college in 2011. His first job required that he apply for \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na security clearance. As noted above, he failed to respond to the Government\u2019s interrogatories \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nduring the processing of his earlier security clearance application. He \u201cdeferred\u201d his mental health \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nneeds until May 2019, a period of 14 years since he stopped treatment in 2005. He is now committed to \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nliving a life that prioritizes the treatment of his mental-health disorders. (Answer at 4-6.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing provided additional details about this period of his life. He \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreported that when he was 18 he was hospitalized for two weeks and was given his first diagnosis by a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmental-health professional. He did not take his treatment plan seriously and failed to take his medication \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas required. While living abroad, he had no health care. He experienced severe anxiety and emotional \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nswings associated with Bipolar Disorder. He took no medication during the 14-year period from 2005 to \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2019, with the brief exception of taking tranquilizer medication during part of his college years. When he \n \n \n \n \n \nfirst applied for a security clearance, he was experiencing severe anxiety and depression. He attributed \nhis failure to respond to the Government\u2019s interrogatories in 2013 to his mental-health condition at that \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntime.

He provided more historical detail about his \nmental-health conditions. He was ultimately diagnosed by a licensed social worker with Bipolar II Disorder and \nChronic Mood Disorder in 2003. During the years 2005 through 2019, Applicant elected to forego any counseling or \nmedication to address his mental-health disorders. He acknowledged that, even after submitting his SCA in May \n2016, he was still in denial about his need for mental-health treatment. After the DoD CAF\u2019s request for a \npsychological evaluation in March 2019, Applicant decided to seek mental-health treatment again. He testified that \nthis decision was made before his June 2019 psychological evaluation. In her June 2019 Report, the LCP noted that \nApplicant had only seen his new therapist once and could not recall the therapist\u2019s name or the medication \nprescribed by the therapist. Applicant emphasized at the hearing that his decision to begin mental-health \ntreatment three years after his submission of his second SCA was based upon his desire to address his \ncondition. (Tr. at 20-22, 35, 62-63; GE 2 at 4; GE 4.) \nApplicant began seeing a licensed clinical social worker in May 2019. The last session with that therapist \nwas in the first part of 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic began. He only attended four sessions with her. \nStarting in November 2019, he has been under the care of a psychiatrist, who monitors his medication. Over time, \nApplicant has scheduled appointments with his psychiatrist less and less frequently. He only sees the psychiatrist \nwhen he needs to adjust his medications. He last saw his doctor in August 2020. Applicant\u2019s primary therapy is \nparticipating in group counseling, which he began in June 2019. That counseling started out as weekly group \nsessions, but the therapy has more recently been reduced to about once every three or four weeks. He is committed \nto taking all necessary steps to continue to maintain sound mental health. (Tr. at 35, 38-39, 41, 68-70; AE A at 3.) \nApplicant testified that he has engaged in consistent, effective therapy and has been extremely compliant \nwith his medication, which he listed in AE B. He believes that he is supported by a social network that he calls a \n\u201csafety net\u201d of individuals who are fully familiar with his mental-health issues. He feels he has the support of his \ntherapist in the event of any emotionally difficult experiences. He testified that even with his medication, he \nexperiences anxiety symptoms, although this happens infrequently. He testified candidly that he experiences \nhypomanic episodes as part of his Bipolar II Disorder in which he has \u201cdays of incredibly intense anxiety.\u201d He \ntestified that he has been open and forthcoming about his condition in his dealings with Government security \nofficials.

In his Answer, he wrote: \u201cI believe that a repeat evaluation by a licensed psychologist would \nconclude that my current course of treatment is effective and that my prognosis is extremely good.\u201d (Answer at 3.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted \u201cVerifications of Treatment\u201d from his psychiatrist, dated January \n21, 2020, and March 5, 2021; and from both his therapist and group-counseling therapist, both dated January 8, 2020. \nNone of the verifications provide a diagnosis, though the two therapists wrote that his prognosis is \u201cvery good\u201d \nwith continued treatment. The verifications set forth limited factual statements describing Applicant\u2019s treatment \nplan and his compliance with it. The most detailed information was provided by Applicant\u2019s group-counseling \ntherapist, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (the LCSW), in a one-paragraph statement. In January 2020, she wrote \nin relevant part: \n[Applicant\u2019s] progress has been excellent and he is very conscientious about following through \non treatment recommendations and homework.

She updated that letter in a post-hearing \nsubmission, dated March 7, 2021 (AE H), in which she wrote: \nIn summary, I believe [Applicant] has made great progress in managing his care. Although mental \nhealth will always be an aspect of his life that will need to be controlled, I feel he is more than \ncapable of addressing any situation that may arise successfully. \n \nApplicant testified sincerely that he is highly motivated to continue his compliance  with his treatment plan because it \n \nis only by doing so that he avoids painful daily anxiety.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe describes himself as \u201cfunctional\u201d but \u201cnot neurotypical.\u201d He said that he has no intention to ever use \nmarijuana again because it only makes his anxiety worse.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for there to be a concern under this \nguideline. A duly qualified mental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted when \nevaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, \nincluding prognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the standards in this \nguideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG & 28 contains five potentially disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. Four of the \nconditions apply to the facts found in this case: \nAG  \u00b6 28(a):  behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not \ncovered under any other guideline and that \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited \nto, \nirresponsible, \nviolent, \nself-harm, \nsuicidal, \nparanoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, \ndeceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition \nthat may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness; \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \nAG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed psychological/ \npsychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but \nnot limited to, failure to take prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling \nsessions. \nAG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from psychological \nconditions.

The most recent evidence in the record from a mental-health professional is \nthat of Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist, dated March 5, 2021. The psychiatrist is not employed by the U.S. Government, and \nthere is no evidence in the record that he is acceptable to, or has been approved by the U.S. Government. Unlike the \nLCP, who provided an impressive eight-page CV with her evaluation, the record contains no information about the \ncredentials or expertise of Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist. The recent evidence from Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist is also a \n\u201cVerification of Treatment.\u201d It consists of four sentences with minimal information, none of which is relevant to the issue \nof whether Applicant\u2019s condition is under control or in remission or whether there is a low probability of recurrence or \nexacerbation. The doctor merely concluded with a factual statement that Applicant \u201cconsistently participates in \ntherapeutic activities.\u201d \nThe two \u201cVerifications of Treatment\u201d from Applicant\u2019s other therapists are dated more than one year prior to the \nclose of the record. Neither of the earlier \u201cVerifications of Treatment\u201d in the record address the two factors listed in this \nmitigating condition, i.e., that Applicant\u2019s previous condition is \u201cunder control\u201d and that there is \u201ca low probability of \nrecurrence or exacerbation.\u201d The most relevant statement was written by the leader of Applicant\u2019s group-therapy \nsessions, who asserted that \u201cwith continued treatment and proactive use of therapeutic techniques, [Applicant\u2019s] \nprognosis is very good.\u201d This could be viewed as stating that Applicant\u2019s previous condition is \u201cunder control.\u201d She \nqualifies the favorable prognosis, however, with the critical unknown in this analysis, which is whether Applicant will \ncontinue his treatment and proactively use therapeutic techniques in the future. \nI cannot predict Applicant\u2019s future involvement in therapy any more than the therapist can. His past history of \n14 years of noninvolvement in therapy raises significant concerns, as noted by the Government\u2019s LCP, given the \nestablished long-term nature of his diagnosis. Applicant has been in therapy now for less than two years. He sincerely \ntestified that he is committed to continuing his treatment plan, and his wife has strongly supported his commitment. His \nactions, however, undercut his words. He has only seen his therapist on four occasions since May 2019. He last saw \nhis psychiatrist in August 2020 and then only for medication management. The critical component of his treatment plan \nis the group therapy. This treatment focuses on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, which has been very \nhelpful to Applicant. He has, however, reduced his participation in the group status to about every three or four weeks. \nOverall, the record evidence does not support full application of this mitigating condition. Applicant\u2019s \ncommitments in words to his therapy does not appear to be matched by his actions. With less than two years in \ntherapy, it is too soon to conclude that he will continue to receive the therapeutic help he needs to manage his mental-\nhealth conditions with consistent success. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d) is not established. The evidence supports the conclusion that Applicant\u2019s condition \ninvolves a lifelong struggle to overcome his Bipolar II Disorder and his Anxiety Disorder. In his testimony, he candidly \nexplained that he struggles on a daily basis to control his anxieties. Under these circumstances, I cannot \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s disorders have been resolved and that he no longer shows indications of emotional \ninstability. \nFor the same reasons, AG \u00b6 29(e) is not established. Applicant readily admits that he has a current problem. \nIn light of the record as a whole, Applicant failed to carry his burden to establish mitigation of the security \nconcerns raised by his psychological conditions. A significant gap in his mitigating evidence is the absence of an \nopinion of a mental-health professional who has recently evaluated Applicant and provided an unqualified \nopinion that persuasively rebuts the opinion of the Government\u2019s LCP, who evaluated Applicant in June 2019. \nWithout such evidence, Applicant\u2019s relatively brief period of successful therapy and treatment does not fully \nmitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. \nWhole-Person \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person \nconcept. In applying the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances and \napplying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) \nthe \nnature, \nextent, \nand \nseriousness \nof \nthe \nconduct; \n(2) \nthe circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and \nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;(8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional comments are warranted. Applicant\u2019s whole-person evidence is impressive. He has \ndemonstrated that he is a highly functional person, who happens to also have been burdened from an early age \nwith serious mental-health disorders. He is to be applauded for his courageous decision in May 2019 at age 33 to \nseek help, notwithstanding the fact that the instigation for that decision may have been the DoD CAF psychological \nevaluation request in March 2019. He faced a risk that he would be deemed ineligible to work in his chosen field of \nnational security after that evaluation. Now, at age 35, Applicant\u2019s experience with serious and potentially \ndebilitating mental-health disorders is ongoing.

He is a retired master gunnery sergeant (E-9) in the Marine Corps. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, 15, and 17; Applicant Exhibit C at 4-5; Tr. 39-40.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant denied all the allegations in both SOR 1 and SOR 2. He also submitted additional information to support the granting of national security eligibility. Specifically, the Government alleged in SOR 1 that Applicant had not filed his 2011 through 2018 Federal tax returns as of the date of the SOR, May 14, 2020. Applicant denied this allegation, stating in Answer 1 that he had filed all of the subject returns in 2019. Applicant retired from the Marine Corps in 2011 and began working overseas as a contractor. All or most of the salaries of Americans who are working and living full-time overseas are exempt from Federal taxes. The maximum Foreign Earned Income Exclusion rose from $92,900 in 2011 to $103, 900, which covered all of his post-retirement income from the defense contractor, as shown in his tax documents.

Applicant\u2019s dilatoriness was due to confusion regarding rules on Americans working \noverseas, rather than an intent to avoid taxes. Resulting security concerns were \nmitigated. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 18, 2018.

(Answer 2.) \nThe Government was ready to proceed on July 31, 2020. The case was assigned \nto me on August 11, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na notice of hearing on March 17, 2021. The hearing was convened as scheduled on April \n12, 2021. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection.

Applicant requested the record remain open for \nreceipt of additional information. On April 28, 2021, Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibit \nC, which was also admitted without objection. The record then closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 54 years old and separated. He has a high school education and is \nemployed by a defense contractor as a Site Manager. He is a retired master gunnery \nsergeant (E-9) in the Marine Corps.

Applicant \ndenied this allegation, stating in Answer 1 that he had filed all of the subject returns in \n2019. \nApplicant retired from the Marine Corps in 2011 and began working overseas as a \ncontractor.

Even though his wages were \nnot taxable, Applicant\u2019s employer withheld Federal taxes at the zero exemptions rate, \nwhich meant that the largest amount of withholding would be withdrawn. Applicant \nmistakenly believed that the fact his wages were not taxable meant that he did not have \nto file a return. Applicant discussed this erroneous belief with a Government investigator \nfrom the Office of Personal Management (OPM) on June 25, 2019. He later testified, \u201cI \nkind of looked at it as a savings account, to be honest with you. When I needed it, I could \nget it.\u201d (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 25-27.) \nOn September 12, 2019, Applicant was contacted by a Department Counsel (DC) \nfrom DOHA. That DC asked Applicant if he had filed his tax returns from years 2011 \nthrough 2017. Subsequent to that initial email DC and Applicant continued to \ncommunicate through the remainder of 2019. In an email dated September 16, 2019, DC \nstated, \u201cBecause it appears OPM may have given you some inaccurate information \nregarding this issue [Applicant\u2019s unfiled tax returns]. I\u2019m going to delay further processing \nof your file for a brief period to permit you to address the situation.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A.) \nApplicant subsequently stated to DC in an email dated November 20, 2019, that \nhe had filed all the required returns. The last email that Applicant had in his possession \nis dated December 17, 2019. In that email he stated to DC, \u201cI have been checking on my \nstatus at least every other day and all that I can tell you is that I was told that it could take \n6 weeks before I hear anything back since I had to do a paper return.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit \nA.) \nGovernment submitted two subsequent emails between Applicant and DC. \nApplicant emailed DC on December 30, 2019, stating that he still had not received any \nnew information from the IRS, but he had filed all the required tax returns. DC responded \non December 31, 2019, asking Applicant to scan and email him all of the documentation \nApplicant had sent to the IRS. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant stated that he never \nreceived this email. (Answer 2; Tr. 15-16.) \nTurning to the specific tax years at issue: \nIRS records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant\u2019s 2011 Federal tax return \nwas \u201creceived for processing\u201d on December 30, 2019. Those records further show that \nafter applying various credits Applicant had no balance owed for that year. This \ndocumentation also resolves the allegation in SOR 1.b that Applicant owed $805.31 for \nthat tax year. (Applicant Exhibits B at 1, C at 6-7; Tr. 23-24, 27-28.) \nIRS records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant\u2019s 2012 Federal tax return \nwas \u201csecured\u201d on December 30, 2019. Those records further show that after applying \nvarious credits Applicant had no balance owed for that year. In fact, the records show \nApplicant received a refund.

Those records further show that after \napplying various credits Applicant had no balance owed for that year. (Applicant Exhibits \nB at 4, C at 12-13; Tr. 31.) \n \nIRS records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant\u2019s 2014 Federal tax return \nwas \u201csecured\u201d on January 2, 2020. Those records further show that after applying various \ncredits and transfers Applicant had no balance owed for that year. This documentation \nalso resolves the allegation in SOR 1.d that Applicant owed $1,255.50 for that tax year. \n(Applicant Exhibits B at 5, C at 16-17; Tr. 32-33.)  \nIRS records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant\u2019s 2015 Federal tax return \nwas received for processing on December 27, 2019. Those records further show that after \napplying various credits Applicant had no balance owed for that year. In fact, Applicant \nreceived a refund for that year. (Applicant Exhibits B at 6, C at 18-19; Tr. 31.) \nIRS records dated March 20, 2021, show that Applicant\u2019s 2016 Federal tax return \nwas received for processing on November 25, 2019. Those records further show that after \nthis return was examined and various credits applied Applicant had a credit balance owed \nto him of $8,216, for that year. According to Applicant he has yet to receive this money. \n(Applicant Exhibits B at 7, C at 20-21; Tr. 30, 33.) \nIRS records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant\u2019s 2017 Federal tax return \nwas filed on January 6, 2020. Those records further show that Applicant had a credit of \n$7,837 for that year transferred out to his 2012 taxes. (Applicant Exhibits B at 8, C at 22; \nTr. 33-35.) \nIRS records dated April 14, 2021, show that Applicant\u2019s 2018 Federal tax return \nwas filed on December 30, 2019. Those records further show that Applicant had a credit \nof $7,287 for that year transferred out to his 2012 taxes. (Applicant Exhibits B at 9, C at \n24-25; Tr. 33-35.) \nApplicant has been in discussions with the IRS about his 2019 and 2020 taxes. \nApplicant stated that he is ready and able to file those tax returns once the IRS has \nconcluded their work with his old tax returns and finished sending him any money that is \nowed to him, which the IRS stated would be by the end of May 2021. He also stated that \ndealing with the IRS has been difficult because of the pandemic. Applicant further \nindicated that he believed he would receive a substantial refund for 2019 and 2020. \nFinally, Applicant stated that he would sure to timely file his returns in the future so as to \navoid this confusion.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns, as required, for tax years \n2011 through 2018. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant had been delinquent in filing his tax returns due to confusion over the \nrequirement to do so since he lived and worked overseas. Applicant also had a good-\nfaith, but mistaken, belief that if he did not owe taxes he did not have to file a tax return. \nAs stated, Department Counsel contacted Applicant in September 2019 and informed him \nof the requirement to file his past tax returns, and that he might have received improper \ninformation from OPM. At that point Applicant got to work and filed all of his delinquent \ntax returns by the end of 2019. Through a breakdown in communication Applicant did not \nforward the information to DC. The facts show that Applicant had filed all of his tax returns \nmonths before the date of the SOR. Once his current situation with the IRS is concluded \nand he has received all the money he is owed, Applicant indicated a credible intent to not \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nallow this situation to recur in the future. Applicant fully mitigated the concerns over his \nincome tax return issues. Guideline F is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided sufficient \nevidence to show that he has resolved his tax issues, and that they will not recur in the \nfuture. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has been resolved. Overall, the \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Before coming to the United States, he spent 22 \nyears as a local employee at a United States consulate in India. He has lived in the U.S. \nsince 2008 with his family and been a U.S. citizen since 2013. He has held a position of \npublic trust for several years as a State Department contractor. He now seeks access to \nclassified information. The foreign influence security concerns about Applicant\u2019s family \nconnections to both India and Pakistan are mitigated through the overwhelming \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s long service to the U.S. Government, his long and well-\nestablished family ties to the United States, and his strong, whole-person character \nwitness evidence presented by several senior U.S. diplomats and other State \nDepartment employees. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 4, 2017. \nOn December 16, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n\n \n2 \n \n \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder foreign influence. The DOD CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 11, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). The case was assigned to me on August 18, 2020. On September 18, 2020, \nDOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for October 15, 2020.  \n \nOn September 23, 2020, I issued a Case Management Order to the parties by e-\nmail. It largely concerned procedural matters relating to the health and safety of the \nhearing participants due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The parties were ordered to \nsubmit their proposed exhibits in advance of the hearing, and they did so. \n \nBefore the hearing, Applicant provided the names and contact information for ten \ncharacter witnesses, one of whom would testify live (and did so), and nine of whom \nwere available to testify by phone. All of Applicant\u2019s proposed witnesses also provided \nletters of reference (AE B). All of them were also current or former diplomats, Foreign \nService officers, or other employees of the U.S. Department of State. Each proposed \nwitness would attest to Applicant\u2019s character largely on the basis of their professional \nrelationship with him. Sua sponte, I requested that Applicant limit the number of his \ncharacter witnesses on the grounds that some of the testimony would likely be \ncumulative. (HE III; Tr. 16-20) \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1-2 were \nidentified and admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C were also identified and admitted without objection. AE D was marked but \nwas not admitted as it did not relate to Applicant. (Tr. 36-41) AE A was attached to \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR. Applicant and one other witness testified live. Five \ncharacter witnesses testified by phone. I held the record open after the hearing to allow \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional evidence. On October 23, 2020, he \nsubmitted several documents, all concerning his finances, along with a narrative \nstatement in his e-mail. I marked the e-mail and documents as AE E, and the exhibit \nwas admitted without objection. The record closed on October 30, 2020. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) the same day.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nThe Government submitted written requests that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts about India and Pakistan. (Administrative Notice (AN) I and AN II) Without \nobjection, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts contained in the requests \nthat are supported by source documents from official U.S. Government publications. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nWhere appropriate, I have taken notice of updated and current information from the \nState Department website, consistent with my obligation to make assessments based \non timely information in cases involving foreign influence. ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) (\u201cDecisions in Guideline B cases should be made to the \ngreatest extent possible in the context of current political conditions in the country at \nissue.\u201d) These facts are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the Guideline B allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) and \nincluded a narrative statement with his Answer. His admissions and other comments \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is now 53 years old. He was born in India. He graduated from high \nschool in India in 1987, and attended two years of college there, earning an associate\u2019s \ndegree. (Tr. 42, 56-57; GE 1) He and his wife have three grown children. His wife and \nchildren are now U.S. citizens and residents.  \n \n \nFrom 1986 until 2008, Applicant was employed at a United States consulate in \nIndia as a local employee. He started working in the mailroom and later became a \ncontracting agent. (Tr. 51) He was not a U.S. State Department employee, and does not \nreceive a State Department pension for this work. He receives a minimal pension of \nabout $20 a month through an Indian insurance company. (Tr. 42-43, 45, 54-55, 59-61, \n111-112) This was confirmed by Mr. H, Applicant\u2019s character witness, a retired State \nDepartment employee. (Tr. 117-118) \n \nIn 2008, Applicant was granted a Special Immigrant (SI) Visa by the U.S. \nAmbassador to India. Several witnesses testified that granting of such a visa is rare and \nis a testament to Applicant\u2019s character and value to the United States. (Tr. 42-43, 45, \n54, 123-124) SI Visas are granted to those who have been \u201cexceptionally loyal and \n[who] would have provided exceptional service to the U.S. Government.\u201d (Tr. 120)  \n \nApplicant and his wife married in India in 1991. (Tr. 58) Their three children are \nall in their 20s. They were all born in India. (GE 1) They immigrated to the United States \nin 2008. Applicant testified that he came to the United States \u201cfor the betterment of my \nchildren.\u201d (Tr. 62) His children all live at home. His son works in information technology. \nOne daughter recently graduated from college and is now a teacher. His younger \ndaughter is in college. (Tr. 46-48, 58-59; GE 1) \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 2013. He is not a dual citizen, though as a \nnative of India, he maintains an Indian overseas identification card. (Tr. 62-65).  \n \nFrom 2008 until 2011, Applicant worked at a large retailer and later at a \npharmacy in the U.S. Since 2011, he has worked for State Department contractors as a \nproject manager. (Tr. 65-67, 102-104; GE 1) In 2015, he was granted eligibility for a \n\n \n4 \n \n \nposition of public trust and eligibility for access to sensitive U.S. Government \ninformation, as Department Counsel confirmed after the hearing. (Answer, Tr. 67, 102; \nHE 3) Applicant now seeks a security clearance. (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father worked for 35 years (1951-1986) as a local employee at the \nsame U.S. consulate in India where Applicant later worked. (AE A) Applicant\u2019s father is \nnow deceased. Applicant\u2019s widowed mother, age 84, lives in India. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) She \nnever worked outside the home. She receives a pension from the U.S. Government due \nto her husband\u2019s career at the consulate as a State Department employee. (Tr. 35-43, \n45, 49, 52-53, 56, 73-74, 110-112) (Mr. H testified that State Department regulations \nchanged in the 1980s, which is why Applicant\u2019s father was considered a retired State \nDepartment employee entitled to a U.S. Government pension, while Applicant is not). \nApplicant testified that he talks to his mother by phone about once a week. He sends \nher about $500 a year. (GE 1; Answer; Tr. 74-75)  \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b concerns two of Applicant\u2019s brothers (B1 and B2) and three of his \nsisters (S1, S4, and S5). All of these siblings are Indian citizens, and all but one of them \nreside there.  \n \nB1 is a citizen and resident of India. He works for an oil company. He is married \nand has children. Applicant talks to B1 about once or twice a month. (Tr. 75-76; GE 1) \nB2 is an Indian citizen, but he lives in Dubai, where he works as a mechanic. Applicant \nspeaks with B2 a few times a year, on religious holidays. (Tr. 77, 107-108; GE 1) \n \n \nS1 (born in 1960) lives in a large city in India. She is widowed. Applicant speaks \nwith her on about a quarterly basis. (Tr. 77-78; GE 1) \n \nS4 is a citizen and resident of India. In 1965, when S4 was born, her mother was \ntravelling in Pakistan, and was unable to return to India, as the two countries were then \nbriefly at war. S4 is not a citizen of Pakistan. S4 is widowed. Applicant speaks to her \nquarterly. (Tr. 78-80, 107) \n \nS5 is a housewife in a large city in India. Her husband works in construction. \nApplicant speaks to S5 about every few months. (Tr. 80-81; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant has two other sisters, both of whom are citizens and residents of \nPakistan. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) S2 (born in 1962) and S3 (born in 1964) were born in India, but \nare now citizens and residents of Pakistan because they married two Pakistani brothers \nwho were friends of the family of Applicant\u2019s father in Pakistan. Applicant contacts S2 \nand S3 about every six months. One of their husbands works as contractor at a \nshipyard. The husband of the other sister is deceased. (Tr. 82-87, 107-108; GE 1) \nThere is no indication in the record that Applicant has ever travelled to Pakistan to visit \nthem. (Tr. 94) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant provides about $1,600 in annual financial \nsupport to some of his family members in India and Pakistan. Applicant testified that he \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhas also sent some money to his wife\u2019s family members when they have been out of \nwork in the past. (Tr. 87-93) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant has \u201cseveral friends and associates who are \ncitizens of India.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.d does not describe or suggest any specific person or any \nbond of affection or obligation (or even a level of contact Applicant might have with such \na person that might suggest such a bond). Nor is it alleged that any of these unspecified \npersons are currently residing in India. Applicant \u201cadmitted\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.d in his Answer but \ndid not specifically address any such \u201cfriends and associates\u201d either in his Answer or in \nhis testimony other than to note that he has Indian friends who worked with him at the \nconsulate. (Tr. 50-51) \n \n \nSince coming to the United States in 2008, Applicant has returned to India twice. \nIn 2014, he travelled there with his wife and children after his mother-in-law passed \naway. He also travelled to India with his family in 2019. He saw (and stayed with) his \nmother and his siblings in India. He did not travel to Pakistan. (Tr. 93-94, 98-100) \n \n \nDuring the period when he worked as a local employee at the U.S. consulate, \nApplicant was subject to routine background investigations. On occasion, like other \nsuch employees, he was harassed by local entities. At the time, the Indian state where \nthe consulate was located was subject to Communist influence. According to Mr. H, this \nis no longer the case. (Tr. 95-98, 108-109) Applicant disclosed these incidents of \nharassment and attempts at exploitation and duress to embassy authorities, as he had \nbeen trained to do. (Answer; Tr. 97-98) Mr. H testified the consulate had a system in \nplace to protect its local employees from local harassment. (Tr. 126) \n \n \nApplicant has a $73,000 annual salary. (Tr. 104; AE E) He and his wife own their \nhome, which they purchased in 2017, and they have ample financial assets in the U.S. \n(Tr. 69-72) He holds no assets in India. (Tr. 67) His wife owns two undeveloped parcels \nof property outside of the city in India where she grew up. They have little value. (Tr. 68-\n69, 105-106; GE 1; AE E) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses included a current United States ambassador \nand two former U.S. consul generals, as well as several other current and former U.S. \nForeign Service officers and State Department employees. All of them knew or worked \nwith Applicant at the U.S. Consulate in India when Applicant worked there as a local \nemployee. Some of them have maintained more recent contact with Applicant. \n \n \nMr. H is retired from the State Department after 42 years of service. He is now a \nState Department contractor. (Tr. 115-116; AE B) Mr. H worked at the consulate in India \nfrom the early 1990s to 2001 and supervised Applicant there. He attested that he and \nthe Applicant\u2019s character witnesses were \u201cwithout exception\u201d impressed by his loyalty \nand integrity and that Applicant was universally held in high regard, and was highly \ntrusted. (Tr. 119-125) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nMr. H also testified that any local employee is subject to a background check with \nlocal police forces and through U.S. intelligence. There are also stringent reporting \nrequirements, as well as a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for all local embassy employees. \nApplicant followed all reporting rules appropriately when he was at the consulate. (Tr. \n127) Mr. H. closed his testimony by affirming that, \u201cIf I did not believe absolutely in \n[Applicant\u2019s] judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability, I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d (Tr. \n128) \n \nW1 is a current State Department employee. She knew Applicant at the \nconsulate (2005-2008). She has had some contact with him at State Department \nheadquarters in more recent times. She offered a strong endorsement of Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter and loyalty, while recognizing that Applicant cares for his family in India. (Tr. \n131-138; AE B) \n \n \nW2 is retired from both the State Department and the U.S. Navy. He worked with \nApplicant at the consulate from 2002 to 2005. (AE B) He attested to Applicant\u2019s \nattention to detail and dedication to the United States. He said Applicant\u2019s \u201coverall \nperformance and his overall attitude was one that I wish others would emulate. . . . I \ndon\u2019t think you could ask for a more trusted person to be doing what he\u2019s doing.\u201d (Tr. \n138-143) \n \n \n \nW3 was the consul general at the consulate in India (the senior U.S. foreign-\nservice officer on post) during a period when Applicant was there. She attested to \nApplicant\u2019s diligence, competence, and trustworthiness under difficult circumstances. \nApplicant provided valuable service to the U.S. mission in India in getting information on \nthreats in the region at the time. W3 stated that \u201cthere are few persons in the greater \nuniverse of the U.S. Mission throughout India who deserved a Special Immigrant Visa\u201d \nand she strongly endorsed Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. (Tr. 143-147; AE B) \n \n \nW4 was also a consul general at the consulate in India during the period when \nApplicant was there. W4 remains employed by the State Department as a \u201cDiplomat in \nResidence.\u201d He testified that Applicant was one of the best employees at the consulate. \nHe maintained a positive attitude, and was always thorough and diligent. He was a \nleader among the Muslim employees at the consulate and worked to ensure a \nharmonious relationship among local religious groups there (Christian, Hindu, and \nMuslim). Applicant is a dedicated family man, and his family connections in India and \nPakistan do not detract from his loyalty to the United States. (Tr. 148-153; AE B) \n \nApplicant\u2019s final witness, W5, is a current U.S. Ambassador. He testified by \nphone from his post overseas. He is a career State Department foreign-service officer. \nHe knew Applicant at the consulate, and they have kept in casual touch since their time \nthere. W5 noted that Applicant\u2019s judgment, conduct, and suitability were never in \nquestion during the time they worked together. He offered a strong recommendation. \n(Tr. 169-174; AE B)  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nI also considered the reference letters of the character witnesses who testified at \nthe hearing, as well as the letters from those who did not. They all offered similar, and \nstrong, endorsements of Applicant\u2019s character, value to the United States, judgment, \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and overall suitability to hold a clearance. (AE B) \n \nRepublic of India (India): (AN I) \n \nThe Republic of India (India) is a multiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy \nwith a bicameral legislature. The president is the head of state, and the prime minister is \nthe head of government. India has a history of economic and industrial espionage \nagainst the United States. In its administrative notice filing, the Government provided \nseveral examples of criminal cases brought in recent years by the U.S. Department of \nJustice concerning export enforcement relating to India.  \n \n \n \nThe State Department has issued a \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d warning (Level 4) for India \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a warning that travelers to India should \u201cExercise \nIncreased Caution\u201d (Level 2) due to \u201ccrime and terrorism.\u201d \n \n \nIndia continues to experience terrorist and insurgent activities that may affect \nU.S. citizens directly or indirectly. Anti-Western terrorist groups, some on the U.S. \ngovernment's list of foreign terrorist organizations, are active in India, including Islamist \nextremist groups such as Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami, Harakat ul-Mujahidin, Indian \nMujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Lashkar-e Tayyiba. Past attacks have targeted \npublic places, including some frequented by Westerners, such as luxury and other \nhotels, trains, train stations, markets, cinemas, mosques, and restaurants in large urban \nareas. Attacks have taken place during the busy evening hours in markets and other \ncrowded places, but could occur at any time. Attacks are usually more frequent around \nmajor holidays. The Maoists (also known as \u201cNaxalites\u201d) are the most active insurgent \ngroup in India. The Naxalites typically attack Indian government officials, but have also \nderailed trains, targeted government buildings, such as police stations, and conducted \nother criminal activity.  \n \n \nAccording to the U.S. Department of State, the most significant human rights \nproblems in India during 2019 included unlawful and arbitrary killings, extrajudicial \nkillings perpetrated by police; torture by prison officials; arbitrary arrest and detention by \ngovernment authorities; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners \nin certain states; restrictions on freedom of expression and the press; frequent reports \nof widespread corruption at all levels of government; violence and discrimination \ntargeting minorities based on religious affiliation or social status; and forced and \ncompulsory labor including bonded labor. A lack of accountability for official misconduct \npersisted at all levels of government, contributing to widespread impunity. Corruption is \npresent at all levels of government. \n \n \nUnder a mass electronic surveillance data-mining program, Indian governmental \nagencies can monitor electronic communication in real time without informing the \nsubject or a judge. The program gives Indian agencies centralized access to the \n\n \n8 \n \n \ntelecommunications network and the ability to hear and record phone calls, read private \ne-mails and text messages, and track geographical locations of people in real time.  \n \nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan): (AN II) \n \n \nPakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. The prime minister is head of \ngovernment, and the president is head of state. The country has endured direct military \nrule for nearly half of its time as an independent nation. The United States has had \ndiplomatic relations with Pakistan since Pakistan\u2019s creation in 1947. Their relationship \nhas been guided by their common interests in a peaceful, stable, and prosperous \nregion. \n \nThe U.S. State Department advises American citizens to reconsider travel to \nPakistan (Level 3) due to COVID-19, the risk of terrorism, and sectarian violence. The \nUnited States remains concerned about the continued presence of terrorist and other \nextremist groups in Pakistan. Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Pakistan. A \nlocal history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of violence by extremist \nelements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as local military and \npolice targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation \nhubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist \nlocations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. Terrorists \nhave targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past. \n \n \nThe State Department\u2019s most recent human-rights report on Pakistan reflects the \nreported commission of human rights violations by elements within Pakistan and the \nPakistani government. The most serious human-rights problems in Pakistan include \nextrajudicial and targeted killings, disappearances, torture, the lack of rule of law, and \nsectarian violence. Government corruption is a serious problem, and the lack of \naccountability and failure to prosecute these abuses has led to a culture of impunity. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n10 \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. It denotes a risk \ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \ngovernment or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family \nties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and several siblings are citizens and residents of India, and he \nhas two sisters who live in Pakistan. The serious, human-rights issues, the ongoing \nthreat of terrorism there, and the governments\u2019 inability to stem corruption in both India \nand Pakistan all create a \u201cheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d They also create a potential conflict of interest. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \n \n \nIt is not disqualifying under Guideline B for an Applicant to send money to foreign \nfamily members, even though doing so may be evidence of a familial bond. SOR \u00b6 1.e \nis therefore found for Applicant.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant has \u201cseveral friends and associates who are \ncitizens of India.\u201d No specific person is identified, nor is it alleged that such persons \neven reside in India. Even though India is established as a \u201cheightened risk\u201d country, \nSOR \u00b6 1.d does not describe or suggest any specific person or any bond of affection or \nobligation (or even a level of contact Applicant might have with such a person that might \nsuggest such a bond). Having unspecified friends or associates in a heightened-risk \ncountry is not disqualifying. SOR \u00b6 1.d is found for Applicant, as no disqualifying \nconditions are sufficiently alleged or established. \n \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n\n \n11 \n \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \n \nApplicant has several immediate family members who are citizens and residents \nof India and has two sisters in Pakistan. In light of the administratively noticed facts \nabout those countries and the heightened risk shown, AG \u00b6 8(a) has limited \napplicability.  \n \n Applicant has frequent contact with his mother and fairly regular, though less \nfrequent, contact with his siblings. It cannot be said that his relationships with his \nimmediate family members are casual. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply.  \n \nThe evidence in support of AG \u00b6 8(b), however, is overwhelming. Applicant, like \nhis father before him, served as a valued and trusted local employee at a U.S. \nconsulate in India for many years. He was subjected to harassment from local \ninfluences, and by all accounts acted properly, reporting any such contacts to \nappropriate embassy authorities. Even before becoming a U.S. citizen, he had \nestablished a long track record of trustworthiness and acting in the best interests of the \nUnited States. It was for this reason that he was granted a SI visa in 2008 by the U.S. \nAmbassador. Applicant and his family subsequently immigrated to the U.S. to afford \nthem a chance at a better life. He began working as a State Department contractor in \n2011, even before becoming a U.S. citizen in 2013.  \n \nApplicant has held a position of public trust as a State Department contractor, \naffording him eligibility for access to sensitive information, since 2015. While this is not \ndispositive, it is nonetheless a significant fact in Applicant\u2019s favor, as there is nothing in \nthe record to suggest a substantive change of circumstance that warrants denial of \naccess to classified information now. \n \nApplicant also presented significant and strong whole-person character evidence \nthrough his witnesses and their reference letters (including from those who did not \ntestify). Those witnesses conveyed and communicated their strong trust in Applicant to \n\n \n12 \n \n \nact in the best interest of the United States. Their testimony and evidence serves to \nbolster Applicant\u2019s years-long track record of acting in that fashion.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor while \nhe testified. Applicant was an impressive and candid witness. Applicant presented a \nstrong case in mitigation and in support of his request for access to classified \ninformation. I also found his witnesses highly credible, and give significant weight to \ntheir testimony and their State Department backgrounds. After carefully weighing the \nevidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and considering the whole-person factors set \nforth in AG \u00b6 2(d), the foreign influence security concerns about Applicant\u2019s family \nconnections to both India and Pakistan are mitigated through the overwhelming \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s long service to the U.S. Government, his long and well-\nestablished family ties to the United States, and his strong whole-person character \nwitness evidence presented by numerous senior U.S. diplomats and other State \nDepartment employees.  \n \n \nThe record evidence therefore leaves me with no questions or doubts as to his \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \n \n                                               \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On November 21, 2019, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines D (Sexual \nBehavior), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of \nDefense on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on December 14, 2019, and \nrequested a decision without a hearing. On January 27, 2020, pursuant to \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.7 and \nE3.1.8 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, Department Counsel requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 27, \n2020. The case was reassigned from another judge to me on January 20, 2021. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on \nDecember 22, 2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 1, 2021. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits A through D, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He requested that the record be \nleft open for additional documentation. He submitted Applicant Exhibit E in a timely \nfashion and it was received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on February 17, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 59 years old, and married with three adult children. He has a high \nschool education with additional college classes. Applicant is employed by a defense \ncontractor as an Analyzer and is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for a security \nclearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 17.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he engaged in sexual behavior that reflects a lack of judgment, or may subject \nApplicant to undue influence or coercion. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the two \nallegations in the SOR under this guideline with exceptions and explanations, stating in \nhis Answer, \u201cI admit to a sexual relationship for 6 months, [approx.] 1989 to 1990.\u201d He \nalso submitted additional evidence to support his request for a finding of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant testified that he was sexually involved with his sister-in-law (Ms. One) \napproximately 20 to 50 times between 1993 and 1994. At that time she was 14 and 15 \nyears old, being born in 1978. Applicant was in his late 20s at the time of their involvement \nand in the Navy. With regard to the relationship, Applicant stated, \u201cIt was wrong. It was \ntotally wrong. I have no excuses.\u201d I have compared Applicant\u2019s testimony of the \nrelationship with the statements of Ms. One to local and Naval authorities. Many of the \nclaims made by Ms. One appear to be exaggerations, particularly about the number of \ntimes they had sexual intercourse. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4; Tr. 19-21, 40-46.) \nIn May 1995 Ms. One\u2019s parents found out about her sexual relationship with \nApplicant and reported it to the local police. The local police coordinated with the Naval \nauthorities and Applicant was arrested and charged with Unlawful Sexual Intercourse, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.b and 3.c. Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management on June 20, 2017. A Report of Investigation (ROI) was prepared \nby the investigator, which Applicant certified to be accurate on September 28, 2019. The \ninvestigator prefaces the discussion about the above events as follows, \u201cHe [Applicant] \noffered the following detailed information to the best of his memory: in approximately 1985 \n(exact date not recalled) he was in the navy [sic] and was stationed in Redding, CA.\u201d The \nROI goes on to state that Applicant became involved with Ms. One in 1985 (when she \nwould have been eight years old). The ROI reports that Applicant further stated that the \nrelationship lasted six months or less. These statements are factually incorrect. \n(Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 33-39.) \n \n \nApplicant was extensively questioned about the differences between the \nstatements in the ROI and the facts as presented by other exhibits, and agreed to by \nApplicant in his testimony. Applicant adamantly stated he simply could not remember the \nexact years things happened when he was questioned in 2017, or when he prepared his \nOral Copulation of a Person Under 16, and Lewd Act Upon A Child. From the available \nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony, it appears he pled guilty to Lewd or Lascivious \nActs With a Child 14 or 15 Years of Age, and Sexual Intercourse With a Child 14 or 15 \nYears of Age. He was sentenced to one year in the county jail. He ended up serving eight \nmonths on work release. Applicant also served probation successfully. He has had to \nregister yearly as a sex offender since that time as required by state law. Applicant has \nbeen consistent in fulfilling his legal responsibilities. (Government Exhibits 5, 6, and 7; Tr. \n21-27, 29-31, 40.) \nDuring the time he was incarcerated Applicant was separated from the Navy for \nmisconduct with a General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions), as supported by his \nDD Form 214. (Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 27-28.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant\u2019s conduct alleged under \nParagraph 1 was also criminal activity that creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, such conduct calls into question Applicant\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant denied this allegation. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. In his Answer, \nApplicant denied all three subparagraphs under this guideline. \n \n3.a. The Government alleged in this subparagraph that Applicant\u2019s sexual \nrelationship with Miss One, as set forth above, was also cognizable under this guideline. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, wife and oldest son wrote letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nThey all acknowledge the \u201cunfortunate situation that involved both of my daughters.\u201d They \nall say he has paid a severe price over many years and has learned from his mistakes. \n(Applicant Exhibits A, B, and C.)  \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be \nused in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nAnswer. He particularly stated that he did not have access to the exhibits presented by \nthe Government, which contained accurate dates. Applicant testified, \u201cI\u2019ve never denied \nany wrongdoing.\u201d When asked by Department Counsel if he was downplaying what \nhappened between himself and Ms. One he testified, \u201cNo. I would never downplay this. \nIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s taken lightly at all. I would never take this lightly. So, I would \nnever downplay anything. Like I said, I would rather get it right the first time instead of \nhaving to reopen this over and over again. But, I will if I have to.\u201d (Tr. 36-39.)  \nMitigation \nPolicies \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n4 \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for sexual behavior are set out in \nAG \u00b6 12, which reads in pertinent part: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person . . . \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply to the facts of this case under \u00b6 13: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern or compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant was sexually involved with his minor sister-in-law in 1993 and 1994. \nApplicant was arrested in connection with that involvement, pled guilty, and served his jail \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsentence, including probation. He registers every year with his state as a sex offender. \nAll of the above disqualifying conditions apply to the facts of this case. \nThe following mitigating conditions have been considered in this case under AG \u00b6 \n14: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the security significance of his misconduct. \nThe evidence of record, including letters from his wife, son and mother-in-law, show that \nthis behavior no longer serves as a basis for any coercion. While Applicant is not proud \nof his conduct, he does not hide the fact that it happened. The misconduct happened over \n25 years ago and he has not been involved in any other type of misconduct, sexual or \notherwise, since that time. While he has to register as a sex offender, that fact is not \ndeterminative, as further discussed below. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. One condition applies: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAs stated, Applicant was arrested, charged and convicted of sexually-related \noffenses in 1995. He pled guilty and successfully fulfilled his sentence, including \nprobation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns. Two are applicable to the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs stated, it has been over 25 years since Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. He fulfilled \nall of his sentencing requirements, and has not had any recurrence of criminal conduct \nsince that time. His family, with intimate knowledge of his misconduct, state that he has \ngrown since this incident and that there is no chance of recurrence. Paragraph 2 is found \nfor Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are applicable under AG \u00b6 16: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information, or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law when she was a minor. \nThis resulted in criminal penalties as discussed above. The Government also alleged that \nApplicant falsified material facts when he was questioned by a Government investigator. \nAll of the cited disqualifying conditions arguably apply. \nThe following conditions are mitigating under AG \u00b6 17: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nTurning first to his sexual misconduct with his sister-in-law. As discussed above, it \nhas been over 25 years since this occurred, there were obviously unique circumstances, \nit has not recurred and it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith regard to his interview with an investigator from OPM, it must first be \nremembered that a statement being wrong does not necessarily mean it was made with \nthe intent to deceive. There is the possibility it could just be an error. That is so in this \ncase. It is important to note that in the ROI the investigator indicates that Applicant was \ngiving information \u201cto the best of his memory.\u201d The investigator also states that Applicant \nwas giving information about times when \u201cexact date not recalled.\u201d The Government was \nput on notice that Applicant was speaking from memory, which is fallible. There is \ninsufficient evidence to find that he \u201cdeliberately\u201d provided false information during the \ninterview. \nDepartment Counsel noted the possible applicability of the DOHA Appeal Board \ndecision in ISCR Case No. 09-03233 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2010), which held that the \nadministrative judge erred in a Guideline J case in her evaluation of contrary evidence \nconcerning that Applicant\u2019s activities. That case is distinguishable. As noted in footnote 2 \non page 3 of the Appeal Board decision, that case was an administrative decision, where \nthe judge did not have an opportunity to question the Applicant or observe his testimony. \nIn this case Applicant was extensively questioned by Department Counsel and myself \nabout the discrepancies noted in the SOR. I was able to determine his demeanor and the \noverall positive credibility of his testimony and other positive evidence of record. He was \nobviously mistaken, but not actively trying to deceive the Government. \nI have also considered the fact that Applicant is required to continue to register as \na sex offender more than 25 years after the incidents in question. In this case that fact is \nmitigated by his decades-long history of non-involvement with law enforcement, along \nwith the positive recommendations of his mother-in-law and wife, who are intimately \nrelated to Applicant and his victim and knowledgeable of the facts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his sexual and criminal misbehavior with regard to his then-minor \nsister-in-law, Miss One, and his personal conduct with regard to his mistakes about dates \nin his interview. He established a solid record of lawful behavior, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment over the past 25 years, and minimized any potential for coercion or duress. \nOverall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present \nsuitability for national security eligibility, and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 30, 2017, Applicant completed and signed his security clearance \napplication (SCA). On November 25, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations).

He admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 2.a, \nand he denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.e. He also provided notice that he had obtained the services \nof an attorney. On May 14, 2021, I e-mailed Applicant\u2019s counsel to schedule Applicant\u2019s \nhearing. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the hearing notice \non June 17, 2021, setting the hearing for June 30, 2021. The hearing proceeded as \nscheduled on the Defense Collaboration Services video-teleconferencing system. \nDepartment Counsel submitted three documents, which I admitted into evidence \nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1, 2 and 3, without objection. Department Counsel \nsubmitted a request for administrative notice of facts concerning the nations of Somalia \nand Kenya, with supporting documents. I accepted the entire packet as Administrative \nNotice (AN) I, without objection. Applicant testified and submitted five documents that had \nbeen submitted with his SOR response, which I admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough E, without objection.

I granted the \nrequest with no objection. (Tr. 8; AE A) \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries and supporting documentation for \nadministrative notice concerning foreign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to Somalia and Kenya. Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice \nof facts concerning Somalia and Kenya, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion.  \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts: \nSomalia \nIn 2012, Somalia was established as a federal parliamentary republic. The United \nStates formally recognized the Federal Government of Somalia in January 2013. U.S. \nforeign policy objectives in Somalia are to promote economic and political stability, \npromote democratic reforms, oppose international terrorism, and alleviate humanitarian \ncrisis caused by conflict and poor weather conditions. \nThe United States supports the success of the African Union Mission in driving Al-\nShabaab, a terrorist organization, out of strategically important population centers.

Violent crime \nsuch as kidnapping, bombings, indirect fire attacks, murder, assassinations, armed \nrobbery, carjacking, and illegal roadblocks by armed individuals in uniforms occur \nthroughout Somalia, including in Mogadishu. The U.S. government cannot provide \nconsular services to U.S. citizens in Somalia. \nThe terrorism situation in Somalia remains unstable and dangerous. No area in \nSomalia is immune from violence; the potential exists throughout the country for hostile \nacts, either targeted or random, against foreign nationals at any time. \nKenya \nKenya is a republic with three branches of government: a president, who is directly \nelected by the people; a bicameral parliament; and a judiciary. After an election which \nwas disputed in Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, President Kenyatta took office on November 20, \n2017. The United States and Kenya have partnered in counterterrorism efforts. \nThe State Department advises to exercise increased caution when traveling in \nKenya due to crime, terrorism, health issues, and kidnapping. Violent crime, such as \narmed carjacking, mugging, home invasion, and kidnapping, can occur at any time. Local \npolice are willing but often lack the capability to respond effectively to serious criminal \nincidents and terrorists attacks. \nIn 2018, the most significant human rights issues in Kenya continue to include: \nunlawful and politically-motivated killings, forced disappearances, torture, and harsh and \nlife-threatening prison conditions; impunity, arbitrary arrest and detention; an inefficient \njudiciary; arbitrary infringement of citizens\u2019 privacy rights; restrictions on press freedom \nand freedom of assembly; lack of accountability in many cases involving violence against \nwomen, including rape and female genital mutilation/cutting; and criminalization of same-\nsex sexual contact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old.

(Tr. 20-22, 47, 75-77; GE 1, GE \n2, GE 3) \nForeign Influence: \nApplicant has three sisters. Two of his sisters are naturalized citizens and residents \nof the United States, and the third sister is a citizen of Sweden currently residing in the \nUnited Kingdom. He also has four brothers. Three of his brothers are naturalized citizens \nand residents of the United States, and his fourth brother is a citizen and resident of \nSomalia. This brother had previously been incarcerated in the United States for drug-\nrelated offenses, but in the Fall of 2020, he was deported to Somalia. Applicant saw his \nbrother during his trip to Somalia in late 2020, after the death of his father. Applicant does \nnot have a good relationship with this brother, and he does not want anything to do with \nhim, to include continuing contacts or providing financial support. Applicant\u2019s two sisters \nand three brothers residing in the United States intend to remain in the United States, and \nthey have no future intentions to visit Somalia. (Tr. 32-34, 53-56, 79-80; GE 1, GE 2, GE \n3) \nApplicant has numerous cousins who are citizens and residents of Somalia. \nApproximately four of these cousins receive financial support from Applicant and his \nfamily members about two or three times a year. It is usually related to a relief effort, and \nthey have collectively sent much more money than $3,650 since 2013, as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. The two or three times a year Applicant contributes money for his cousins usually \nrange between $100 and $200 per occurrence.

For example, seven months may \ngo by without any communication, and then all of a sudden, they may talk two-to-three \ntimes, followed by several months of no contact. Both of these friends are unaware that \nhe is in the process of applying for a DOD security clearance, and neither of them are \nemployed by the Somalian government.

On one occasion in 2017, while \nApplicant was staying with his friend during a trip to Somalia, his friend\u2019s father asked \nApplicant to come with him and visit two foreign embassies. He wanted Applicant\u2019s \nassistance in the event he needed English translation while conducting business at the \nembassies.

Since 2011, he and his spouse \nhave provided approximately $25,000 in financial support to them. Applicant testified that \nhis mother-in-law is in the U.S. as a permanent resident. She is currently employed in a \nchildcare facility. Applicant and his spouse do not always need to provide financial support \nto her because of her employment. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen and remains a \nresident in Kenya.

In 2016, his \nfriend\u2019s father, mentioned above, had a mining business in Kenya that needed to be \nreopened. Applicant and his friend were offered employment to resurrect the mining \nbusiness. Applicant looked into this business prospect and was willing to relocate his \nfamily to Kenya if the business venture looked profitable. After evaluating the business, \nhe realized that it did not have a favorable outlook and discarded the offer of employment. \n(Tr. 23-24, 44-46, 67-70, 82, 84; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) \nApplicant traveled to the United Kingdom, Somalia, and to Kenya twice in 2012. \nHe traveled to Sweden for four months to visit his sister, the United Kingdom, Somalia, \nand to Kenya twice in 2013. In 2016, he traveled to Somalia and made two trips to Kenya, \nand in 2017 he traveled to Somalia and made two trips to Kenya once again.

(AE B, AE C, AE D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise security \nconcerns, and the following are potentially applicable in this case: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThere is a threat of terrorism and human rights violations in Somalia and Kenya. \nApplicant has ongoing connections with his father-in-law, cousins and friends, and he \nprovides financial support to family members in both countries.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere are widely-documented safety issues for residents of Somalia and Kenya \nbecause of terrorists and insurgents. The mere possession of close family ties with one \nor more family members living in these countries is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B; however, if an applicant has a close relationship with even one relative \nliving in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See \nGenerally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0424 (App. Bd.

The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must \nbe made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, the government ignores the rule of law including widely accepted civil \nliberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the \ngovernment is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a substantial amount of \ndeath or property damage, or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection \noperations against the United States. The relationship of Somalia and Kenya with the \nUnited States, and the hostile and dangerous situation in both countries place a \nsignificant, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that \nhis and his spouse\u2019s relationships with family living in Somalia and Kenya do not pose a \nsecurity risk. \nApplicant has limited contact with his foreign cousins and friends, and he does not \nhave any contact with his brother in Somalia. He maintains regular contact and financial \nsupport to his father-in-law in Kenya. Applicant\u2019s spouse did not prove the absence of \ncontacts with her father living in Kenya. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have ever \nserved in or been employed by the Somalian or Kenyan government or military. It is \nunlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests \nof foreign family members and the interests of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \nApplicant has lived in the United States for 25 years, including the entirety of his \nprofessional career and married life. He has been employed as a translator for many \nyears. One of his professional associates praised his dedication, work performance, work \nethic, and exemplary character. His wife has established her career as a registered nurse \nin the United States, and Applicant\u2019s two children are U.S. citizens by birth, currently \nattending school in this country. Applicant and his wife are fully acclimated to the \nAmerican lifestyle. The majority of his siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens living in the \nUnited States. There is no conflict of interest given Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding \nrelationships in the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s cousins and friends in Somalia since the contact \nis casual and infrequent, and there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. It does not apply to Applicant\u2019s father-in-law in Kenya. \nBased on the overall circumstances of Applicant\u2019s lengthy and deep connections \nto the United States and limited connections to Kenya and Somalia, I conclude foreign \ninfluence security concerns are mitigated. \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The SOR alleges \ndefaulted student loan accounts totaling $44,000. Applicant obtained these loans for his \ncollege education. He understood he was legally responsible to repay the loans. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \nconditions is required. \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. \nApplicant\u2019s only delinquent debt involves his defaulted student loans that have \nbeen delinquent for a number of years. He is current on all of his other financial \nobligations. The facts show that Applicant traveled extensively overseas, he provided \n$3,500 for a failed business venture, and he has provided, and continues to provide, \nfinancial support to foreign family members. He has not made a single voluntary student \nloan payment in the last decade. In 2019, he and his wife made over $150,000 in annual \nincome. During the pandemic in 2020, they made approximately $117,000. Applicant \nstated that he does not have enough income to repay his student loans, and recently, he \ntestified that he was unable to find his student loan creditor when he tried to re-establish \ncommunication. \nIn light of his travels, business investment, and ongoing financial support to family \nmembers, I find that repaying his student loans has not been a priority for Applicant. This \nsix-figure income the last two years illustrates Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so. He has failed to show that he has dealt with his student \nloan creditor responsibly, or that he established a good-faith effort to repay his financial \neducation obligation. There is no evidence in the record that the problem is being resolved \nor addressed. Applicant\u2019s promises to pay his student loans at some point in the future, \nwithout further confirmed action, fail to remove the lingering doubts that remain whether \nhe has demonstrated the judgment, reliability, and willingness to abide by well-\nestablished rules and regulations that are required for granting a security clearance. I find \nthat Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B and Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) \nfactors in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships in the United States sufficiently \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns raised from connections with family \nmembers and associates in Somalia and Kenya. He failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. The primary concern in this instance is that Applicant \nfailed to take responsible action over a number of years to address his defaulted student \nloans, and while he offered some explanations for his conduct, those explanations do not \nadequately justify his long period of inaction. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility.

Since January 2010, they have lived with his wife\u2019s family \nfree of charge, taking care of his elderly father-in-law, who is an alcoholic and incapable \nof caring for himself. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is deployed overseas in support of U.S. \nforces as a linguist. During a counterintelligence screening interview in July 2018, \nApplicant explained that he was unemployed because he lost his certificate of \nnaturalization in January 2010 while moving to another state, could not afford the fee to \nobtain a replacement copy, and was embarrassed to ask for money so that he could pay \nthe fee for a replacement. He did not provide any evidence of the cost of a replacement \ncertificate, but it would have been relatively expensive. The current fee for a replacement \ncertificate is $555. (www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees.) In April 2018, a friend gave \nApplicant the money to replace the certificate of naturalization, enabling him to obtain his \ncurrent job in June 2018. (GX 4 at 6; GX 5 at 3.) \nBetween March 2007 and September 2018, Applicant was involved in several \nincidents of criminal conduct, which are alleged in reverse chronological order in the SOR. \nThe evidence concerning these incidents is summarized below. \nSOR 1.f: In March 2007, Applicant uttered an insufficient-funds check, was \ncharged with a felony bad-check offense, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He has \ngiven several somewhat different explanations of the circumstances surrounding his \nuttering an insufficient-funds check. During the counterintelligence screening interview in \nJuly 2018, he stated that he cashed a $1,200 check at a casino so that he could pay a \nutility bill. (GX 5 at 10.) In a personal subject interview (PSI) in August 2018, he told a \nsecurity investigator that he gave the check to his wife for delivery to her father. (GX 4 at \n12.) In his response to the FORM, he stated that he wrote the check to pay a utility bill, \nnot realizing that he had insufficient funds to cover the check. (FORM Response at 7.) \nApplicant agreed to repay the bad check over a six-month period, but failed to do \nso. (GX 5 at 10.) In September 2011, after he had moved to another state, he was stopped \nfor a traffic violation, the outstanding warrant was discovered, and he was arrested. At his \ntrial, adjudication was deferred, conditioned on restitution and good behavior. He \ncompleted paying the restitution in October 2014 and the charge was dismissed. (GX 11.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: In January 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with burglary \nafter stealing diabetic test strips from a retail store, intending to sell them because he \nneeded money. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of shoplifting and was sentenced to \nconfinement for 10 days, payment of fines and restitution totaling $1,140, and ordered to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave no direct or indirect contact with the retail store. He spent five days in jail. The court \nrecords reflect that Applicant had made no payments on the fines or the restitution \nrequirement as of February 7, 2020. (GX 12.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: In July 2012, Applicant was charged with felony possession of \nmethamphetamine. He gave two explanations for this incident: (1) that he was alone and \ndisposing of his wife\u2019s methamphetamine pipe after she had abstained for two years \n(FORM Response at 6; GX 4 at 13); and (2) that he was walking with his wife, they were \nstopped by a policeman for jaywalking, and he took the pipe from his wife to shield her \nfrom being charged (GX 5 at 9). He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of drugs \nand was sentenced to imprisonment for three days, credited with time served, and \nrequired to attend drug-education classes. (GX 10.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: In July 2012, Applicant was charged with petit larceny for stealing \ndiapers from a store. The purpose for stealing diapers is unclear, because his only child \nwould have been 14 years old at the time. (GX 3 at 23.) He pleaded guilty and was ordered \nto attend drug counseling and to stay out of trouble for six months. (GX 9.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: In July 2013, Applicant was charged with domestic battery. His wife \nand intoxicated father-in-law were arguing, and his father-in-law was shouting and \ncursing. Applicant pushed his father-in-law while trying to keep his wife and his father-in-\nlaw separated, and his wife called the police. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated \nthat that he declined to press charges against his father-in-law and that his father-in-law \ndid not press charges against him. During the counterintelligence screening interview, he \ntold the investigator that the charges were dismissed because his father-in-law was too \ndrunk to appear in court. (GX 5 at 10.) However, the court records reflect that a criminal \ncomplaint was filed against Applicant, an arrest warrant was issued, he was taken into \ncustody, and a public defender was appointed. On request of the defense, he was \nreleased on his own recognizance, on the condition that he could not live in the same \nhouse as his father-in-law. In August 2013, the charges were dismissed \u201cper \nnegotiations.\u201d (GX 8.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: In September 2018, after Applicant submitted his SCA and had \nundergone his counterintelligence screening and a PSI, he was charged with felony \nlarceny, after stealing a music compact disc worth about $25 from a store. In his answer \nto the SOR, he stated that he intended to give the compact disc to his wife as a birthday \ngift. In his response to the FORM, he stated that he tried to return the compact disc to the \nstore for store credit so that he could buy personal necessities. He pleaded no contest to \nmisdemeanor petit larceny and was sentenced to confinement for 60 days, suspended; \nfined $500, satisfied by transfer of cash bail; and ordered to have no contact with the \nstore. (GX 7; Response to FORM, AX D.) \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income \ntax returns and owes federal and state taxes. The evidence concerning each allegation \nis summarized below. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a (federal tax debt) and 2.d (failure to timely file returns for 2006, \n2007, and 2008). When Applicant submitted his SCA in July 2018, he disclosed that he \ndid not file any income tax returns after he was laid off in November 2007, and that he \nbelieved he owed about $1,200 in state or federal income taxes. (GX 3 at 36-37.) During \nhis counterintelligence screening interview, he stated that he visited an IRS office in \nFebruary 2018 and was informed that his tax debts for 2006, 2007, and 2008 had been \ncharged off as bad debts and were treated as income. (GX 5 at 16.) It is likely that \nApplicant misunderstood the IRS employee, because the IRS subsequently informed him \nthat he owed $49,637 for tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008. \nOn February 27, 2018, Applicant made an installment agreement with the IRS to \nresolve his tax debt by paying $50 per month beginning in April 2018 (GX 4 at 18; GX 13; \nAX H.) In his answer to the SOR, he submitted an Annual Installment Agreement \nStatement from the IRS reflecting payments between July 2018 and July 2019, reflecting \ntwo payments of $100 and $350. (Answer at 6-8.) He also submitted copies of 14 money \norders, two of which were illegible. They were issued between January 2018 and \nNovember 2019. All are for $50, except one for $82 that was issued in April 2018. The \ncopies do not reflect the payee, except for the one dated June 23, 2019, on which he \nwrote \u201cUnited States Treasury.\u201d (Answer at 9-11.) Finally, he submitted copies of his bank \nstatements reflecting eight payments to the U.S. Treasury between April and December \n2019, in amounts varying from $20 to $100. (Answer at 15-37.) In his response to the \nFORM, he submitted an e-file signature authorization (IRS Form 8879) dated June 1, \n2020, for a 2019 federal tax return reflecting taxes of $540 withheld and claiming a refund \nof $540. (AX H.). \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b (failure to timely file state income tax return for 2006) and 2.c \n(state tax debt of $2,595). Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax return for \n2006, incurring a delinquent tax debt of $2,595. In January 2019, he submitted a request \nfor an installment agreement providing for monthly payments of $250. (GX 14.) In his \nanswer to the SOR, he submitted copies of his bank statements reflecting six $250 \npayments to the state tax authority between March and November 2019. (Answer at 15-\n36.) In his response to the FORM, he submitted evidence that he made $250 payments \nin September 2020, October 2020, and December 2020. (AX G.) He also submitted \nphotocopies of money orders for $250 purchased in March, April, June, September, and \nOctober 2020, but the photocopies do not reflect the payees for those money orders. (AX \nH.)  \nIn July 2020, Applicant completed a computer-based course of instruction on \nfinancial management developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. (AX K.) \nIn November 2020, he submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) dated November \n20, 2020. It reflects net monthly income of $5,100, debt payments of $525 ($250 to IRS, \nwith a balance of $49,000; $250 to state tax authority, with a balance of $14,000; and $25 \nto a credit-card account with a balance of $1,000).

They strongly support his application for a security clearance. His two \nlinguist supervisors, an Army major and an Army lieutenant colonel, also strongly \nrecommend that Applicant receive a security clearance. (AX B.)... \nA friend of Applicant, who has known him for 35 years, is now serving at the U.S. \nEmbassy in Kabul, Afghanistan and holds a top secret clearance, submitted a letter \nstrongly supporting Applicant\u2019s application for a clearance. He has reviewed the SOR and \ndoes not believe that the allegations are reflective of Applicant\u2019s character, patriotism, or \nwillingness to protect classified information. To the contrary, he believes that Applicant is \na hardworking, honest, and reliable person who should be granted a clearance. (AX C.) \nThis friend is the person who gave Applicant the money to obtain a replacement for his \nlost naturalization certificate. (GX 5 at 3.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM are sufficient to raise the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior began in March 2007, \nwhen he wrote a bad check for $1,200. He promised to redeem the check but did not \nkeep his promise until he was arrested and convicted in September 2011. His \nirresponsible behavior continued when he failed to file his federal income tax returns for \n2007 and 2008. He was convicted of shoplifting in January 2011, drug possession in July \n2012, and petit larceny in July 2012. He failed to timely file his 2012 federal tax return and \ntook no action to resolve his federal and state tax debts until January 2018.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct in September 2018 occurred after he submitted his \nSCA and was interviewed by a security investigator and the counterintelligence agent. \nWhile there were significant temporal gaps between his bad-check offense in March 2007, \nhis arrest in January 2011, and his arrest in September 2018, he continued to ignore his \ntax obligations during the periods between his arrests. His overall pattern of irresponsible \nconclude casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the charge of domestic battery in July 2013. The \nevidence reflects a domestic disturbance instigated by Applicant\u2019s alcoholic father-in-law, \nwhich Applicant was trying to quell. Once the facts were established, the charges were \ndismissed. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 (d) is not established. The evidence submitted by Applicant\u2019s supervisors \nin Afghanistan reflect that he has distinguished himself by his skill, work ethic, composure, \nand dedication. However, he has been working in a controlled military environment since \nFebruary 2019, and insufficient time has passed to show that he will not revert to his \nprevious pattern of irresponsible conduct when he returns from Afghanistan. \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the bad-check \noffense alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, the failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.d, and the federal and state tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \nand 2.c. I conclude that the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are \nestablished: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nAG \u00b6 19(d) (\u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as . . . check fraud\u201d) is not \napplicable because the bad check uttered in March 2007 was alleged only under \nGuideline J and not under Guideline F. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s tax problems are long-standing, ongoing, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when he \ncashed an insufficient-funds check in March 2007, while he was still employed. He has \nnot established that cashing the check, failure to redeem it, and his conviction in \nSeptember 2011 were the result of conditions largely beyond his control. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from December 2007 until he was hired by his current \nemployer was a condition beyond his control. It was exacerbated by his loss of his \ncertificate of naturalization in January 2010, which also was a condition beyond his \ncontrol. \nHowever, Applicant has not established that he acted responsibly. He has not \nsubmitted any evidence of efforts to obtain employment from December 2007 to January \n2010, before he lost his certificate of naturalization. He is a well-educated adult with \nconsiderable business experience, and it is difficult to believe that he could not find any \nemployment, even if it was a part-time or intermittent job or underemployment for which \nhe was over qualified. He did not replace his certificate of naturalization until June 2018, \na period of more than eight years, because he was too embarrassed to ask his family or \nfriends for financial help in obtaining a replacement for his certificate of naturalization. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant enrolled in and completed an online money-\nmanagement course, and his federal and state tax problems appear to be under control. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are established for Applicant\u2019s federal and state tax debts, \non which he appears to be making regular payments.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines J and F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his failures to timely file federal and state tax returns and pay the taxes due, but \nhe has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.c-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F (Financial Considerations) FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

DOHA received the hearing transcript on June 24, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He is a high school graduate and has earned some \ncollege credits. He married in 2008. His wife had a child that he adopted, and they also \nhave two other children. Their ages are 26, 20 and 18. Applicant has worked for his \ncurrent employer since 2018. (Tr. 15-18) \nIn 2015 Applicant had a motorcycle accident and was severely injured. He had two \nsurgeries on his back, and he was unable to work for about three years. His job involved \nmanual labor. He was working at the time and was later terminated. He was cleared to \nresume work in late 2017 or early 2018. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his \naccident and being unable to work. His wife was working during this time and continues \nto work, but her income was insufficient to cover all of their family\u2019s expenses. Applicant \nalso acknowledged that he had some debts prior to his accident that he had difficulty \npaying. (Tr. 18-22, 34-36, 45-47) \nInitially, Applicant attempted to contact some creditors to negotiate settlements or \nrepayment plans, but was unable to do so because they either demanded the full amount \nbe paid or the payment plans were more money than he could afford. More recently, \nApplicant has contacted some creditors, but the debts had been sold to third-party \ncollection companies, and they wanted full payment of the debts. He has been unable to \nmake payments on any of his delinquent debts due to the amounts owed. (Tr. 22-23, 39\u00ad\n42) \nThe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, statements to a government investigator, and credit reports from August \n2019, February 2020, and May 2021. A review of the May 2021 credit report shows that \nthe accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g and 1.k were resolved by dispute. (GE 1 through 6) \nApplicant\u2019s son attends college and receives a scholarship for his tuition, but \nApplicant pays for his room and board, which is about $5,000 a semester. His older \ndaughter is independent, and his younger daughter lives at home. He and his son have \ncars. One is paid for and the other is financed. His wife drives a car that is leased. \nApplicant also owes about $50,000 for student loans. These loans are in deferment, which \nApplicant indicated expires sometime at the end of this year. He anticipated his payments \nto be approximately $250 a month.

He would like to consolidate his debt when he is able. He estimated \nhis annual salary is about $27,000 and his wife\u2019s is about $23,000. Over the three years \nhe was unable to work, he estimated his out-of-pocket medical expenses were about \n$10,000. He lost his medical insurance when he lost his job after his accident. He used \ncredit cards to help pay his expenses and at times had difficulty paying his rent and \nproviding for his family. His parents helped them out. Applicant currently lives paycheck \nto paycheck. (Tr. 25, 29-35, 49-50) \nApplicant stated that he used Credit Karma to dispute some of his delinquent debts \nto have them removed from his credit report. He had questions about the amounts owed \nand believed there were inaccuracies on his credit report. He did not provide any \nsupporting documents. (Tr. 47-53) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that remain unresolved. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a motorcycle accident he had in 2015. \nHe had surgeries and lost his job and medical insurance. He was unable to pay his debts. \nThese were conditions beyond his control. He testified that he contacted creditors in the \npast to resolve his debts, but he has been unable to do so because he does not have the \nmoney. His debts remain unresolved. He stated that he disputed some debts to have \nthem removed from his credit report. I have given him credit for those accounts that are \non his latest credit report that note they were resolved. He did not provide any documents \nto substantiate other disputes or actions to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, \nbut Applicant did not provide evidence that he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. His debts are recent and ongoing. There is insufficient evidence to fully \napply any of the above mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant was in a serious accident in 2015. He was unable to pay his bills at the \ntime. He is unable to meet the creditors\u2019 demands to resolve his delinquent debts. At this \njuncture, he has an unreliable financial track record, and he has not met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.j \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Tod D. Stephens, Esq. \nDecember 10, 2020 \nDecision \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding his sexual behavior and \ncriminal conduct. Based upon a review of the pleadings, the documentary evidence, and \nthe testimony presented at the hearing, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 25, 2018, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA). The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 28, 2019, detailing allegations \nunder Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), which were cross-alleged under Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), \nas amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neffective for all adjudicative decisions within the Department of Defense on or after June \n8, 2017. \nOn January 20, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer). He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On April 28, 2020, the case was assigned to me. The scheduling of the hearing \nwas delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic safety concerns. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on October 1, 2020, scheduling the hearing for October 28, 2020. An amended \nhearing notice, issued on October 23, 2020, changed the starting time for the hearing to \naccommodate a scheduling conflict. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented seven \nexhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 and an exhibit list, which I \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant offered eight exhibits, which were marked as \nApplicant Exhibits A through H. Absent any objections, I admitted all exhibits into the \nrecord. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 10, 2020. \nSOR Amendment \nAt the conclusion of Applicant\u2019s testimony, Department Counsel moved to amend \nthe SOR by adding new allegations under Guidelines D and J to conform the allegations \nto the evidence. The amendment reads as follows: \n1.c. While travelling in Mexico, in approximately 2004, you engaged in \nsexual activity with a prostitute; and \n2.a. That information as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a though 1.c, above. \nApplicant and his attorney were invited to seek additional time to respond to the \namendment. After consultation with his attorney, Applicant decided not to oppose the \nmotion to amend and not to seek additional time to respond to the amendment. \nAccordingly, I granted the motion to amend to conform the SOR allegations to the \nevidence presented. (Tr. at 45-49, 76-77, 84-89.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions, his testimony and that of his two \ncharacter witnesses, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant, 53, is employed by a U.S. Government contractor as a manufacturing \nengineer and as a quality assurance engineer. He began this job in April 2018. He is \nrequired to have a security clearance to maintain his position. His June 25, 2018 SCA is \nhis first application for a security clearance.

He was separated from \nhis family in 1979 due to an assault by Communist forces on the people in his home area. \nApplicant, his uncle, and his cousins escaped to a neighboring country. Five-to-six \nmonths later, Applicant was reunited with his parents and siblings. In 1980, his family \nimmigrated to the United States with the help of the American Red Cross. He learned \nEnglish in school and attended college courses in his new home country. He did not earn \na degree. (Tr. at 19-21, 23, 58, 60; GE 2 at 8.) \nAfter immigrating to the United States, Applicant met his future wife. In January \n1992, they married pursuant to their culture in their native country. They have not been \nmarried pursuant to U.S. civil law. He has no reason for not marrying his wife legally in \nthis country. They have five children, who are now 8, 18, 25, 26, and 28 years old. \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2010. He became a U.S. citizen 30 years \nafter his arrival in the United States because citizenship was a requirement for his \nemployment at that time. His wife has never become a U.S. citizen. Applicant worked \nhard, sometimes working at two full-time jobs. He purchased a home for his family in \n2017. (Tr. at 21-24, 58-61; GE 1 at 10.) \nApplicant has strong connections to his \u201ccommunity,\u201d immigrants from his native \ncountry who are part of a minority population there. The community is made up of \nimmigrants that entered the United States in 1979-1980. On January 1, 2014, Applicant \nwas appointed a \u201cClan Leader\u201d of his community\u2019s U.S. non-profit organization. One of \nthe main purposes of the organization is to preserve the culture of this immigrant \npopulation. (Tr. at 40, 62; AE G.) \nSexual Behavior and Criminal Conduct \nIn 2006 to early 2007, Applicant began to communicate with others online in a chat \nroom. He did this because he was bored. His online activity became frequent, and he \nspent significant periods of time making friendships online. He \u201cchatted\u201d with many \nwomen and some developed into discussions involving sexual flirtations. He was on the \ninternet \u201call the time, even during working hours because I was the only one there.\u201d He \nwas living a \u201cdouble life.\u201d He developed an online friendship with a person who \nrepresented that she was a 13-year-old girl named \u201cJamie.\u201d Jamie was in fact an \nundercover vice police officer. The two chatted at length over a period of six or seven \nmonths. They frequently chatted about meeting and their online conversations became \nexplicitly sexual. Applicant twice agreed to meet Jamie in her home town, but he failed to \nshow up. A third time in January 2007, they agreed to meet at a train station and planned \non spending time together, which they discussed would include having sex and drinking \nalcohol. Applicant decided to meet Jamie at the train station. When he arrived he was \narrested. (Tr. at 25, 30, 50-52, 63-64; GE 2 at 2-3; AE B at 20.) \nApplicant initially told the police that he had made a mistake. At one point in his \ninterrogation, Applicant was nervous and tried to lie about his reason for being at the train \nstation. He then decided to tell the truth and admit his true intentions. He was charged \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith one felony account of Luring and Meeting a Child for Sexual Interest and three \nmisdemeanor counts of Luring a Child for Sexual Interest. On the advice of his attorney, \nApplicant pleaded guilty to all four charges in 2008. He was fined $4,000 and sentenced \nto ten days in jail and three years of probation. He successfully completed his probation \nin July 2011. One of the terms of his probation was that he receive a psychiatric \nevaluation. He complied, but he did not provide a copy of the evaluation as evidence. He \nwas also unable to recall any of the details of the evaluation, except that he was not \ndiagnosed with an abnormality. There is no record evidence of the evaluator\u2019s diagnosis \nor prognosis. His probation terms also required that he annually register as a sex offender \nfor the rest of his life. He complies with this annual registration requirement. (Tr. at 27-28, \n65-66, 71-72.) \nIn 2008, Applicant entered a counseling program for individuals who had \nexperienced problems with having a sexual interest in children. He claimed that his \nparticipation in the program was voluntary and was not a part of his sentence or probation. \nThe minutes of the July 18, 2008 court proceeding of his sentencing states that Applicant \nis required to \u201ccooperate with Probation Officer in any plan for psychiatric, psychological, \nalcohol and/or drug treatment, or counseling.\u201d He provided no documentation from the \ncourt, probation officer, or the counselor confirming that his counseling was indeed \nvoluntary. He testified that his wife was supportive of his decision to seek counseling. (Tr. \nat 34, 37-41, 51, 68, 70-73; GE 5 at 14.) \n \nThe counseling program involved weekly one-hour group sessions and was \nsupposed to last 18 months. The focus of the group was persons who had sexual \naddiction involving minors. In this program, Applicant learned to identify situations that \ncreated a \u201chigh-risk\u201d for him to repeat his past behavior. He was \u201cbrutally honest\u201d with \nhimself because he wanted to change. Since his 2007 arrest, he has made \u201ca conscious \neffort to better [himself].\u201d Through his counseling, he has come to understand the \u201curges\u201d \nwithin himself that seeks gratification that are hard for him to resist. He learned \u201ctools\u201d \nthat will help him for the rest of his life avoid pursuing his urges. (Tr. 34, 37-41, 51-55, 77-\n78.) \nApplicant was active in the counseling program from 2008 to 2011, much longer \nthan 18 months. He ceased attending about the same time his probation terminated. He \ndid not receive a certificate of completion, however. He testified that he stopped attending \nthe counseling sessions because he was working two full-time jobs to support his family \nand his work schedule did not give him the necessary time to attend. He testified that the \ncompletion of the program was not a \u201cpriority\u201d for him. To obtain a certificate of \ncompletion, he had to complete 21 \u201ctasks.\u201d He only completed about 90 percent of the \ntasks. He offered no documentation from the program that provided a diagnosis or a \nprognosis. He has received no treatment, counseling, or an evaluation of any kind since \n2011. (Tr. at 51-53, 70-76, 82-83; AE B.) \nApplicant provided as evidence some random notes he prepared in his counseling \nsessions. The notes reveal that he intensively examined his sexual interest in and \ninteractions with Jamie. He sought understanding of the causes of his sexual interest in \nunderage girls, and the situations that he believed triggered that interest, which he labeled \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201chigh-risk factors.\u201d He acknowledged at the hearing that having his sons\u2019 attractive young \ngirlfriends\u2019 visits to his home was a high-risk factor. He also acknowledged that his sexual \ninterest in young girls was a significant problem for him and that he needed to take steps \nto control his impulses and avoid acting on those impulses. He testified that in his native \ncountry, it is typical that girls marry at the age of 15. His sexual interest in young girls is \nconsistent with his cultural upbringing. He testified that he enjoyed the flirtation of online \nchatting with Jamie and other woman and that he \u201ccan\u2019t resist,\u201d a phrase that he repeated \na second time for emphasis: \u201cI can\u2019t resist.\u201d In an essay he wrote as part of his counseling, \nhe commented that he would \u201cgroom\u201d underage girls in online chats in the hopes of having \nsex with them. He acknowledged that his sexual urges were \u201creally big and \nuncontrollable.\u201d(Tr. at 64-65, 69, 78; AE B at 20.) \nApplicant has not committed any crimes since his 2007 arrest. He no longer chats \nonline. His immediate family and a close circle of friends know about his criminal history. \nHis employer does not know that he is a registered sex offender, except that his facility \nsecurity officer has seen his SCA. Applicant does not know if his employer would have \nhired him had the employer known about his sex offender status. He has no formal \nsupport system in place to help him should he ever feel a strong temptation to act out his \nsexual impulses with respect to young girls. Moreover, he has not provided a recent \nevaluation of his psychological condition. (Tr. at 33, 35-36, 40, 44, 67-68; AE D, E.) \nIn addition to the above sexual conduct, Applicant also acknowledges other extra\u00ad\nmarital sexual behavior. In 2004 or 2005, Applicant travelled with several male relatives \nto a nearby foreign country. He paid for sex with a prostitute while he was there. He also \nengaged in a close, personal relationship with a 35-year-old female co-worker for about \na year. On one occasion, the woman performed oral sex on Applicant. Applicant recorded \nboth of these incidents in his counseling notes, and his wife learned about them by \nreading the notes. (Tr. at 45-49, 76-77; GE 2.) \nAt the hearing and in his Answer, Applicant expressed his sincere remorse for his \nactions with Jamie. He has refocused his energy on working hard, at times working two \nfull-time jobs, and on supporting his family, clan, and community. He was a clan \nrepresentative to his immigrant community association. He wrote in his Answer that he \nwould never meet a young girl or a woman alone. He values the United States as the \ncountry that offered him protection from the dangers in his native country and considers \nthe United States to be his \u201chome.\u201d (Tr. at 19, 29, 44.) \nCharacter Evidence \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s cousins testified as character witnesses. They both believe that \nApplicant has stepped up and accepted responsibility for his past actions and is a better \nperson for having done so. They testified that Applicant is remorseful for what he did in \nthe past. They do not believe that Applicant presents a future risk to minors. He is a family \nman who works hard to provide for his family. One cousin testified that Applicant is \u201ca \nproductive member of the community,\u201d referring to their immigrant community. The other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncousin commented that Applicant is \u201cactive\u201d in their community. Both live near Applicant. \n(Tr. 89-97, 99-106.) \nApplicant also offered two employment performance evaluations (2018 and 2019). \nThey reflect that Applicant meets expectations and has some room for improvement. His \nperformance is rated at 3 in 2018 and at 2.96 in 2019. The documents do not explain the \nscale or meaning of these numbers. He received bonuses in both years. (AE F.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12 as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \nAG \u00b6 13(b): a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; and \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 14 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from sexual behavior. Four of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; \nand \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal and other sexual \nbehavior occurred 13 or more years ago. His online contact with a person he believed to \nbe a 13-year-old girl was frequent and sexually flirtatious. Applicant\u2019s admitted sexual \ncontact with a co-worker and a prostitute was also long ago and infrequent. For the \nreasons discussed in the analysis of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 14(e) below, Applicant has \nnot, however, met his burden to establish that his criminal sexual behavior is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nAG \u00b6 14(c) is not established, except with respect to the co-worker and the \nprostitute. No one outside of Applicant\u2019s immediate family, including his cousins who \ntestified, knows about his conviction for sexual crimes, with the exception of his security \nofficer who had access to his SCA. Applicant does not know if he could keep his job if his \ncriminal history was known by his employer outside of his security officer. Given the highly \nsensitive and derogatory nature of Applicant\u2019s sexual misconduct, he is vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 14(d) is established with respect to Applicant\u2019s sexual activity with a \nprostitute. His actions were strictly private and consensual. \nAG \u00b6 14(e) is not established. Applicant did not successfully complete his program \nfor persons who are addicted to sexual activity with children and he is not currently \nenrolled in one. He testified that he has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the goal of his treatment program of avoiding any repeated criminal sexual behavior \nwith young girls. He also testified that he no longer chats online. He did not, however, \nprovide evidence of his specific treatment plan and whether he has complied with such a \nplan. Also, he has not provided evidence of a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental \nhealth professional indicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. As a \nresult of this evidentiary omission, the issue of whether Applicant might repeat his past \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehavior is left solely to this adjudication process. I conclude that he has not carried his \nburden of persuasion to mitigate the security concerns raised by his past conduct. His \ncurrent need to resist his urges in high-risk situations creates a risk of recidivism with the \nattendant risks to children and to the national security should Applicant\u2019s conduct be used \nto coerce or exploit him to act contrary to the interests of national security. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal sexual behavior, his failure to complete his counseling \nprogram, and the lack of a strong support system to help him successfully manage sexual \nimpulses place him in a high-risk of recidivism. Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show \nhis criminal sexual behavior is unlikely to recur. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate security concerns raised in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The security concerns raised in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c are mitigated because the incident occurred long ago, has not been repeated, \nand was private and consensual. Overall, Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions, his testimony, and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Two of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): There is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is partially established for the reasons set forth in the analysis under \nAG \u00b6 14(b), above. Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior with a prostitute occurred long ago, was \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ninfrequent and is unlikely to recur. He has not, however, established the critical elements \nof this mitigating condition -- that his criminal behavior with minors is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant\u2019s \nrequirement to give public notice by means of the sex offender registry has been \nrecognized by the Appeal Board as implying \u201ca real possibility of recidivism in the state\u2019s \nview.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-03233 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2010). In addition, Applicant\u2019s \noffenses impugn his trustworthiness and good judgment. Id. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is partially established. Applicant presented evidence of rehabilitation \nconsisting of the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, compliance with \nthe terms of his probation, a good employment record, and constructive community \ninvolvement. This evidence of rehabilitation is not conclusive, however, because the \nevidentiary record is insufficient to permit a conclusion that future criminal behavior with \nminors is unlikely to recur. \nOverall, the nature of Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior and his failure to complete his \ncounseling program; to provide a favorable prognosis; and to put in place a strong support \nsystem to help him successfully manage his actions in the future, creates a risk of \nrecidivism with respect to criminal conduct involving minors. Applicant failed to provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which are \ncross alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant has provided sufficient evidence to mitigate security \nconcerns raised in SOR 1.c. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under these Guidelines and evaluating all of the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his sexual behavior and criminal conduct. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b): \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a (\u00b6 1.c):  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired \nApplicant had significant past due child support and unfiled Federal and state \nincome tax returns. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has filed all of his delinquent tax returns, and is nearly current on his \npast-due child support. Applicant has demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. Financial Considerations is \nfound for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose his delinquent tax filings on his January 2019 SCA. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully \nApplicant made no prompt good-faith effort correct his falsehood regarding his \nFederal and state tax filings. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Personal \nConduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m and 1.n. He denied \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, and 1.l. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 43 years old. He served in the military from 1996 until he was \nhonorably discharged in 2000. He served in the Air Force Reserve from 2003 to 2007 and \nreceived an honorable discharge. He married in 1998 and has three children ages 27 and \ntwins age 14. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011, a master\u2019s degree in 2013, and is \npursuing a doctorate degree. Applicant\u2019s wife has been steadily employed since 2003. \nApplicant has been employed by the same federal contractor since 2006. (Tr. 17-21; GE \n1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, \n2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. He failed to timely file his state tax returns for \nthe same tax years, except 2018. Th SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to the federal \ngovernment for delinquent taxes in the amount of $3,043 for tax year 2013; $3,891 for tax \nyear 2014; $12,186 for tax year 2015; and $3,911 for tax year 2017. (GE 1, GE 2; AE B \nthrough AE I) \nIRS tax transcripts from August 2021 reflect that Applicant filed his 2012 federal \ntax return in August 2014 (he filed for an extension in April 2013); tax year 2014 was filed \nin November 2017; tax year 2015 was filed in November 2017; tax year 2016 was filed in \nAugust 2019; tax year 2017 was filed in August 2019; and tax year 2018 was filed in July \n2019. Applicant provided a copy of his 2019 federal tax transcript that reflects he filed his \nreturn in February 2021. Applicant testified that he has not yet filed his 2020 federat; \nincome tax return.

(Tr. 40-54; GE 2; AE \nB through AE I) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2017 security clearance application (SCA) he disclosed that \nhe failed to timely file and pay 2014, 2015, and 2016 federal income taxes. He anticipated \nhe owed $2,000 for each tax year. He stated: \nSpouse thought that entire process was automated and forgot to complete \nthe final documentation for processing. Discovered the last week of April. \nAppointment made with tax preparer to bring all filing information current. \n(GE 1) \nIn July 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of \nhis background investigation. He explained that he was aware of his tax situation. He \nexplained that there was a misunderstanding between him and his wife, each thinking the \nother had timely filed the tax returns for each year. He told the investigator that his wife \nhad never handled any of their financial matters in the past and was unfamiliar with the \nprocess. Both he and his wife are extremely busy with their own careers. As soon as \nApplicant was made aware of the tax situation he immediately called his accountant who \nhandled the filing of their tax returns and made arrangements with the IRS and his state \nto make monthly payments until the balances owed were paid in full. He had every \nintention of meet his financial obligations now and in the future. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified and affirmed that the reason he did not timely filing tax returns \nwas due to a miscommunication with his wife. He thought she filed the taxes, and she \nthought he did. He testified that they never discussed who was going to file the tax returns. \nIn the past, an accountant prepared their tax returns. Applicant normally was the person \nwho brought their tax information to the accountant for preparation of the return. He did \nnot do this for the delinquent tax years alleged.

He \nhas not discussed with her any actions she may have taken regarding their tax returns. \n(Tr. 21-37; AE B, AE C) \nThe SOR alleged other delinquent debts. Applicant testified that several \nwere paid and they became delinquent due to oversight and a mix up with mail because \nhis father has the same name. He did not have the documents to show which debts were \npaid and he could not remember them. He said the only thing he could do is obtain a new \ncredit report to show the accounts were paid. He did not provide a credit report in his post-\nhearing submissions. (Tr. 22-23, 55-57) \nApplicant has approximately $90,000 of deferred student loans.

The record was held open to allow him to provide \nsupporting documents. He did not. These debts are unresolved.

These debts are not resolved. (Tr. 60-61) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($712) is a charged off account. Applicant testified he \nattempted to contact the creditor about six months ago, but was unsuccessful. This debt \nis unresolved. Regarding the past due account in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($141), Applicant did not \nprovide evidence that he has resolved it. (Tr. 61-62) \nApplicant testified that he has post-traumatic stress disorder from his military \nservice. He did not seek treatment until this year. He stated many aspects of his life are \nimpacted by it. It placed a strain on his marriage. At one point, he was contemplating a \ndivorce. He stated that he had a tendency to not deal with his finances. He stated he \nignored his finances and hoped the issues would go away.

(AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns 2012, 2014, \n2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. He was indebted to the federal government for delinquent \ntaxes for tax year 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017. He has numerous delinquent debts that \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbegan accumulating in 2019 and are unresolved. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn his 2017 SCA, Applicant explained his failure to timely file his tax returns for \nnumerous tax years was because of a miscommunication between him and his wife, each \nbelieving the other had timely filed. Applicant had been responsible for filing returns for \npast years and admitted his wife had no experience. He has not discussed his tax issues \nwith his wife to find out if she took any action on their tax returns. I did not find his \nexplanations for failing to file timely for multiple years credible. After he completed his \nSCA, Applicant again failed to timely file his 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 federal tax \nreturns, showing even after he was on notice that there was a problem, he continued his \npattern of failing to timely file the returns. He has other delinquent debts that he failed to \nprovide documents to show they are resolved or being paid. His debts are recent and \nongoing. His financial delinquencies cast doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngood judgment. Insufficient evidence was provided to show his financial problems were \nthe result of behavior beyond his control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a) and 20(b) do not apply. \nApplicant provided tax transcripts to show his delinquent tax returns have been \nfiled. He owed federal taxes for multiple years. Applicant made some payments to the \nIRS that were applied to his delinquent tax debts. Although he had installment \nagreements in the past, they were canceled when he did not timely file subsequent tax \nyears returns. Applicant owes balances for tax years 2015, 2017 and 2018. He did not \nprovide documentation to show he has a current installment agreement with the IRS. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) has some application. \nApplicant testified that he attended financial counseling in 2018 and 2020. He \nfailed to provide evidence that he is resolving his numerous delinquent debts or has an \nactive installment agreement with the IRS. There are not clear indications that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are under control or being resolved. Although he has made some \npayments to the IRS, there is insufficient evidence that he is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay his tax debt and other overdue creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not \napply. \nApplicant stated that he had resolved several of the alleged debts in the SOR, but \nfailed to provide supporting evidence. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

He continues to owe federal income taxes for multiple tax years. He \nhas numerous delinquent debts that are not resolved. Despite some evidence of \nmitigation, it is insufficient to overcome his failure to timely resolve his tax issues and \nother delinquent debts. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

His failure to pay his other \ndelinquent debts remains a concern. Applicant has not established a reliable financial \ntrack record. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The hearing transcript was completed on November 23, \n2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 49-year-old aircraft painter for a defense contractor, employed since \n2015. Applicant graduated from high school in 1991. He was married in 1992 and divorced \nin 2009. He remarried in 2012 and was divorced in 2018. He has one adult child. His \nsecond spouse had a daughter that lived with them until 2018. Applicant currently has a \nsecret security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) that Applicant was arrested \nin January 2016 and charged with felony indecency with a child/sexual contact. He \npleaded guilty and is on community supervision until August 2024. The SOR alleges the \nsame facts under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nApplicant\u2019s second spouse had a 15-year-old daughter that suffered from Postural \nOrthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) caused by poor blood flow. This condition \napparently caused pain in her arms and legs. To relieve symptoms, Applicant often \nrubbed her arms, legs, and scalp, at her request and often in front of his spouse. On one \noccasion in December 2015, Applicant intentionally grazed the side of the girl\u2019s breast \nover her shirt while riding together in a truck. On another occasion in January 2016, \nApplicant stated he was alone with the girl and began rubbing her while she was in bed \nsleeping. During this occurrence, he used his hand to touch the bottom of her breast and \nbetween her legs several times. He did not penetrate her or pass over her breasts or \nvagina. Shortly thereafter, he was concerned about the criminality of his conduct, and \napologized to her. \nThe girl reported the incidents to her school authorities, and the police were \nnotified. A warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest and he turned himself into police on \nJanuary 20, 2016. Applicant was not indicted, but entered a guilty plea to an information \ncharging him with injury to a child with intent to commit bodily injury (injury to child), a \nthird degree felony. Applicant received a deferred finding of guilt, and was placed on \ncommunity supervision for seven years, known as deferred adjudication probation. The \nconditions of probation include inter alia, submission to a clinical assessment and \ntreatment program with a court-appointed sex offender treatment provider; complete \nclinical polygraph examinations as directed by the therapist; have no contact with children \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nunder 17 years old; submit a DNA sample; submit to alcohol and drug testing; permit a \nprobation officer access to his residence for examination of computers and electronic \nmedia; and refrain from access to pornography, certain places, and personal use of the \ninternet. Applicant\u2019s probation period ends in August 2024. \nApplicant began counseling with the court-appointed provider on January 19, \n2016. He completed 185 treatment sessions and one year of aftercare on August 2, 2020. \nHe will continue to attend one group session per month until 2024 when his probation \nends. Applicant was initially evaluated as having an \u201cexcellent chance of successfully \ncompleting treatment and community supervision,\u201d and had a \u201clow risk to re-offend.\u201d She \nnoted that from the beginning, he \u201ctook full responsibility for his actions and has been \ncompletely honest in all matters.\u201d Applicant complied with state standards for sex offender \ntreatment, and successfully passed several maintenance polygraphs throughout \ntreatment, the last in February 2020. The polygraphs are intended to measure the honesty \nand complying with conditions of treatment and supervision. Applicant also passed a sex \nhistory polygraph that indicated that he had no other victims or abhorrent sexual behavior. \nFinally, Applicant took a penile plethysmograph to assess his sexual arousal. The results \nshowed that Applicant \u201cdid not have any deviant sexual arousal.\u201d \nThe counselor noted that Applicant was the \u201cmost compliant client I have ever had \nin my 38 years of experience.\u201d She noted that it was very rewarding to work with such a \nmotivated client atypical of the majority of offenders she has treated. The counselor \nreported that Applicant has no other victims, was successfully rehabilitated, and \nrepresents an extremely low risk to re-offend. She noted that due to his openness and \nhonesty, he does not present a security risk. She stated that this was Applicant\u2019s first and \nonly offense, and there is no evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or \nemotional instability. (AE A, B, D) \nApplicant\u2019s probation officer noted that he is in full compliance of the conditions of \nprobation, successfully completed sex offender treatment, and has no concerns \npertaining to Applicant. (AE C, E) County policy requires Applicant to remain in \nmaintenance group sessions once per month until his discharge from probation on August \n23, 2024. (AE C) \nApplicant disclosed his conduct to his family and friends. After the incidents, the \nvictim\u2019s mother wrote a letter to the criminal court judge in support of Applicant to retain \nhis employment and avoid severe criminal penalties. She noted that Applicant had been \na \u201cwonderful father\u201d to her children, and that he is \u201ctruly remorseful\u201d and in unbearable \npain for his conduct. She divorced him two years later and she and her daughter live apart \nfrom him. His sister-in-law noted that Applicant made a mistake in judgment, expressed \nregret and remorse to the girl, and he has been \u201ccompletely honest and upfront about \nwhat has transpired with the courts, his family, and his counselor.\u201d Similar sentiments and \nsupport were expressed by Applicant\u2019s father, daughter, brother, brother-in-law, cousins, \nand friends. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant lives alone in a home located in a remote rural environment. He has no \ncontact with the victim or her family, and does not allow unaccompanied contact with \nchildren or personal internet access. The victim is now an adult attending college and \nApplicant has not had contact with her since the incidents. Applicant paid a $20,000 \nsettlement to her in exchange for a waiver of any claims. Applicant stated that he is well \nliked at work, but does not get regular written evaluations. Applicant did not report his \narrest to security personnel at his company until January 5, 2017, almost one year after \nhis arrest, on advice of his counsel. He has not disclosed the incidents to his supervisor \nor coworkers for fear of retribution and ridicule. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13 include: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe record evidence supporting the SOR allegations and Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand testimony are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions listed above. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 are potentially relevant: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program or \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nThe sexual behavior alleged in the SOR occurred in 2016. It has not been \nrepeated, but its occurrence casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment and destroyed the trust \ngiven to him by the victim and her mother. Applicant has successfully completed \nextensive treatment, and his counselor considers him an extremely low risk of re-\noffending. He has no continuing or unaccompanied contact with children, and the victim \nin this case no longer lives with him. Applicant disclosed his conduct with his family and \nfriends, but delayed disclosing it to his employer for almost a year leaving him vulnerable \nto coercion and exploitation. \nApplicant has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with his treatment \nplan, and received a favorable prognosis from his court-appointed counselor. However, I \nfind that Applicant has not fully mitigated the sexual behavior concerns. Applicant \ncommitted a felony sexual abuse crime, and he breached the trust given to him by the \nvictim and his spouse. Despite her initial support for him to retain his employment status \nand avoid severe criminal penalties, she divorced Applicant and she and her daughter \nlive apart from him. Applicant remains on probation for a felony offense with significant \nrestrictions to his lifestyle and personal freedoms. His substantial delay in reporting his \narrest to his employer exposed security vulnerabilities, and his community standing is \nseverely tarnished. No mitigating condition fully applies to overcome his behavior and \nongoing probationary status. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe Security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nindividual is currently on parole or probation. \n (c) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nconcerning his criminal conduct and current probation status are sufficient to establish \nthe disqualifying conditions above. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe discussion above under Guideline D are incorporated herein. Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal behavior occurred almost five years ago, and has not been repeated. Applicant \nhas acknowledged the wrongfulness of the conduct, and successfully completed \ntreatment in 185 sessions, was determined to be rehabilitated, and continues to attend \naftercare sessions. He is no longer in an environment where a relapse is likely to occur, \nhas an acceptable work history, and is in full compliance with the terms of his probation. \nHowever, he continues to be under community supervision restrictions for a felony \noffense until August 2024, and is subject to home searches, DNA, blood, and urine \nsampling, restricted access to certain persons and places, and personal use of the \ninternet. Although AG \u00b6 32 (a) and (d) are partially applicable, no mitigating conditions \novercome the impact of Applicant\u2019s felonious criminal conduct and continuing \nprobationary status. His criminal conduct continues to impugn his status in the \ncommunity, and shows a serious lapse in judgment and trust that has not yet been \nmitigated with time or treatment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines D and J, in my whole-person analysis. I find that \nApplicant was well served by counseling and treatment, and has shown rehabilitation for \nhis offenses. However, I do not believe his sexual behavior or criminal conduct has been \nfully mitigated as he continues to be subject to court supervision and probationary \nrestrictions, and there are continuing doubts about his judgment and trustworthiness. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant or \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n Administrative Judge \nGregg A.

Klimaski, Esq. \n02/17/2021 \nDecision \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behaviors) \nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 15, \n2017. On November 19, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines D and J. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 24, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2020. I \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontacted Applicant on September 11, 2020, to determine his availability for a hearing. \nOn September 11, 2020, Applicant\u2019s counsel entered his appearance. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on October 2, 2020, and the hearing \nwas convened on October 20, 2020. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 18 with an amended exhibit list were admitted \ninto evidence without objection. Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter was marked as HE 1 \nand appended to the record. Applicant and two witnesses testified at the hearing. The \nwitnesses testified by telephone and each provided statements. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old test engineer for a defense contractor, employed since \n2010. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1989 from a U.S. military academy, a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 1996 from a military post-graduate school, and a professional degree \nin aerospace engineering in 1997 from a military test pilot school. He honorably served \non active duty in the military from 1989 to 2020, when he retired. Applicant was a pilot in \nthe military until he retired, and began civilian employment as a test pilot and engineer for \na defense contractor. He was promoted to director, lead tester, and manager in 2016. \nApplicant also owns and manages a consulting business. He married in 1993 and has \nthree children, ages 18 to 25. He currently has a secret security clearance. His security \neligibility was previously suspended in 2006 and reinstated in 2009. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) that (SOR \u00b6 1.a) on at least \nthree occasion between August 2006 and September 2006, Applicant videotaped up the \nskirts of unsuspecting women without their consent; (SOR \u00b6 1.b) in September 2006, \nApplicant was charged and found guilty of five counts of Unlawful Filming or Photography \nof Another; and (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in June 2017, Applicant attempted to take video up the skirts \nof various women in a department store without consent. As a result, he was charged in \nFebruary 2018 with filming a nude person without consent. Finally, the SOR cross-alleges \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He denied SOR \n\u00b6 1.c, filming women in 2017 at a department store, but admitted to being charged. He \nnoted the charge was dismissed and that he is applying for an expungement of the record. \nHe generally admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a consistent with his admissions in SOR \u00b6 1. He submitted \nbackground information about himself, a \u201clife synopsis,\u201d and performance evaluations with \nhis Answer. \n2006 Episodes of Criminal Sexual Conduct \nIn September 2006, while on active duty, Applicant was arrested at an airport after \na passenger notified police that Applicant was using a camcorder placed underneath \nwomen\u2019s dresses to record them (known as \u201cup skirting\u201d) while they picked up bags at a \nbaggage carrousel. Applicant was traveling on official Government business. Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas confronted by police at the scene, and he denied that he had taken pictures or filmed \nanyone or anything. Applicant also denied possessing any tapes or media memory cards \nfor the camcorder. \nDuring questioning by police, Applicant moved from his seat and a videotape fell \nout from his pocket underneath him. When confronted by a police supervisor, Applicant \nchanged his story and confessed to filming women by sliding his bag underneath their \nskirt without their consent or knowledge. Applicant consented to a search of his bag, and \na video camera and several tapes were found. The police viewed the recordings and \nconfirmed that Applicant positioned the camera inside of his bag with the camera lens \nfacing up, and recorded five women. Applicant admitted that one tape was from another \nairport where he conducted the same activity. His confiscated videos also showed \nevidence of taping inside of a mall and possibly a military department store. \nApplicant was charged and found guilty at trial of five misdemeanor counts of \nunlawful videotaping. Applicant sought counseling and treatment during the pre-\nsentencing process, and his attorney requested sentencing be deferred pending \ncompletion of \u201cmental evaluations and treatments.\u201d (GE 4; Incident Data Sheet Report \npg. 10.) Applicant was sentenced on March 20, 2007, to confinement for two-years, \nsuspended, with the charges dismissed pending successful completion of probation for \ntwo years and no further incidents. (GE 9.) \nApplicant testified to filming six to seven women during about 40 minutes at the \nairport in which he was flying for Government business. Applicant admitted to filming \nwomen at another airport after returning from his father-in-law\u2019s funeral. He then admitted \nto \u201cpossibly\u201d traveling to an electronics store where he filmed additional women. Applicant \ndenied filming women at any other location, despite the evidence on the video recordings. \nApplicant hid the tapes from his spouse, and \u201cstruggled\u201d to keep them from her. Applicant \nlearned about up skirting from the internet, and investigators found 1,700 searches for \n\u201cup skirting\u201d on his personal computer. Applicant testified that he last watched up-skirting \nvideos while on probation in 2007, and has not recorded additional videos since 2006. \nIn September 2006, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended. In June 2007, \nApplicant attended an administrative Board of Inquiry to show cause as to why he should \nbe retained in the military. After a hearing, he was retained on active duty and his security \nclearance was reinstated in 2009. In Applicant\u2019s eligibility determination letter, he was \n\u201ccautioned that receipt of any derogatory information in the future, especially of a similar \nnature, will be cause for reconsideration of your eligibility for a security clearance and/or \nspecial access.\u201d (GE 8.) \nIn 2008, Applicant was directed to undergo a medical evaluation at a military \nbehavioral healthcare center. He was evaluated by a staff psychiatrist. (GE 6.) Applicant \nattributed his behavior of filming up women\u2019s skirts in September 2006 as a response to \nstress related to difficult work, not being promoted, and difficulties with a child with \nphysical disabilities. On the day he was caught, Applicant worried about being late for a \nflight so he rescheduled for a later flight. As he sat at the airport \u201cwaiting and working,\u201d he \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas overcome with worry and had an impulse to film under women\u2019s skirts for an \nadrenaline rush. He filmed six to seven women for 40 minutes, but felt worse afterwards. \nApplicant reported to the psychiatrist three incidents where he videotaped women \nwithout their consent. He described the \u201cmost recent incident\u201d as occurring in September \n2006. He noted that prior to the September incident, he had \u201cvideotaped the private areas \nof unknowing women in public.\u201d He described that in August 2006, he was feeling guilty, \nsad, and frustrated about having to return early from the funeral of his father-in-law due \nto work requirements, so he videotaped unsuspecting women at the airport for an \n\u201cimmediate rush.\u201d That day, he also went to an electronics store and proceeded to \nvideotape underneath women\u2019s skirts at the store. \nApplicant relayed to the psychiatrist that when he was approached by police at the \nairport in September 2006, he was evasive in answering questions, but \u201cwas certain that \nhe did not deny having videotaped these women.\u201d (GE 6.) After the \u201clast\u201d incident, \nApplicant reported seeing a psychologist once a week or on alternating weeks for one \nyear, from 2006 to 2007. (GE 6.) Applicant participated in couples counseling, and was \ninvolved with his church. (GE 6.) \nThe psychiatrist concluded that Applicant had been \u201cexperiencing overwhelming \nstressors that contributed to his having videotaped unsuspecting women underneath their \nskirts.\u201d She credited him with \u201cvoluntarily\u201d seeking help and \u201cunderwent treatment for one \nyear under the care of a psychologist [which] suggests good insight into how inappropriate \nhis actions had been and that to seek mental health counseling to address this behavior \nin order to prevent it showed good judgment.\u201d She noted that \u201cthree episodes occurred \nwithin the context of multiple stressors,\u201d and \u201cthis makes the episodes appear to be more \ncircumscribed and as a response to stressors.\u201d Finally, she recommended \u201cregular \nmonitoring by a mental health specialist to ensure that he is addressing the stress in his \nlife productively and is aware of controlling his impulses, especially under stress.\u201d The \npsychiatrist made no DSM diagnosis or prognosis. \n2017 Episode of Criminal Sexual Conduct \nIn June 2017, Applicant\u2019s daughter was playing in a lacrosse tournament in \nanother city. Applicant and his family drove to the tournament to watch. At about 5pm the \nsame day of the tournament, a customer at a nearby department store reported that a \nman used his cell phone facing up in a red shopping basket to film up the skirt of women, \nwithout their knowledge or consent. The store security officer interviewed the witness and \npersonally observed the man place a basket on the floor behind several women with the \ncamera facing up. The man then moved away to look at merchandise and returned to the \nbasket after the women left the spot. At one point, the man attempted to pull a women\u2019s \nskirt open to enhance the view. \nThe man was recorded by store security cameras and identified as he exited the \nstore. A close up, color photo of the man was submitted to local police, and distributed \nvia an online crime solvers network. The photo shows a man that clearly resembles \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant, wearing a shirt bearing the name of a small college located in another state \nfrom which Applicant\u2019s son attended. As a result of the photo being displayed on social \nmedia by the police, at least 100 friends, associates, and coworkers contacted Applicant \nand his spouse and identified him as the person in the picture. \nApplicant \u201cdoes not recall\u201d being at the store, but agreed that the picture \u201clooks like \nme.\u201d The police also interviewed Applicant\u2019s coworkers who clearly identified him as the \nman in the photo. Applicant testified that he owns a similar shirt as that in the photo, but \nhis shirt adds the word \u201clacrosse\u201d near the name of the school. He testified that he was \nat his daughter\u2019s lacrosse tournament that day, and although he owns a car similar to the \none described in the police report, he \u201cwould have\u201d driven a minivan with his family. He \n\u201cdoes not believe\u201d he ever left the tournament that day or visited the department store. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse, who was apparently with Applicant, did not testify or otherwise \ncorroborate Applicant\u2019s account, however Applicant stated that his spouse believes the \npicture was of him, and that he owns a shirt as shown in the picture. Applicant was \narrested and charged in February 2018 with misdemeanor filming a nonconsented nude \nperson. The case was dismissed as nolle prosequi in April 2018. Applicant denied going \nto the store or committing the offense. \nApplicant was interviewed by Government security investigators in 2014 and 2018. \nHe admitted that the 2006 up-skirting videos were taken for an \u201cadrenaline rush\u201d and were \nnot harmful to anyone. In his 2018 interview, Applicant denied the 2017 incident photo \nwas of him, although it looked like him. He described the incident as a \u201ccoincidence.\u201d He \nstated that he was not attempting to victimize anyone in his 2006 up-skirting behavior. He \nclaimed that it impacted his marriage, but had no impact on his home, school, work, \nfriendships, physical or emotional health, reputation, judgment, reliability, finances, or \nability to hold a security clearance. He said it was \u201can isolated incident,\u201d but he knowingly \nparticipated in the conduct. In testimony, he admitted his 2006 filming was harmful to his \nvictims, but denied telling the investigator that it was an isolated incident. He denied that \nhis 2006 behavior was a pattern, and said his involvement was \u201crisk taking behavior\u201d that \nhe no longer engaged in. \nApplicant testified that he attended personal talk-therapy and marriage counseling \nfrom 2006 to 2009. This is contrary to the one-year counseling he told the military \npsychiatrist in 2008. He claimed he left counseling in 2009 feeling \u201con top of his life.\u201d No \ncounseling records from 2006 to 2009 were offered into evidence. \nIn August 2017, after being identified in the latest up-skirting incident, Applicant \nstated that he began talk therapy counseling and mediation to \u201cget at the root cause\u201d of \nbehavior, and to better communicate with his wife and children. He also sought help with \nviewing pornography, and attends Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings from two to three \ntimes per week, or up to five times per week on occasions, to address all levels of \ninappropriate conduct. He is working on the 12-step program, and talks with his priest. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant described his current counselor as a \u201ccertified \nsex addiction therapist.\u201d He stated that he has been attending counseling since August \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2017; initially for marriage counseling but it evolved into individual counseling. Applicant \nclaims his counselor diagnosed him with \u201cgeneral anxiety disorder.\u201d No medical or \ncounseling record were offered into evidence by Applicant to support any diagnosis. \nApplicant stated he was referred to Sex Addicts Anonymous with the primary purpose to \nstop addictive sexual behavior through the 12-step program, and to help others recover \nfrom sexual addiction. He has attended two weekend retreats and has a sponsor. (Ans.) \nApplicant\u2019s counselor testified at the hearing. The counselor stated that he is a \nlicensed clinical professional counselor (LCPC), with a master\u2019s degree in pastoral \ncounseling awarded in in 2013, and an undergraduate degree in biology. No Curriculum \nVitae was provided showing the counselor\u2019s education, expertise, or qualifications. He \nhas worked as a counselor since 2013, and Applicant began seeing him in August 2017. \nHe sees Applicant for \u201cgeneral counseling,\u201d once per week. Applicant\u2019s spouse was \nincluded in one session, despite efforts to invite her for marriage counseling. He testified \nthat at times Applicant attends group counseling, and \u201cmay be\u201d involved in group sex-\naddiction counseling. The counselor refused to disclose details of Applicant\u2019s admissions \nor treatment, other than to say he is counseling him for \u201ctrauma anxiety for life issues and \nincidents.\u201d The counselor believes that there is no need for continued therapy as \nApplicant has a deepening understanding of others, and more compassion and \nunderstanding with his spouse. He believes Applicant is truthful, has grown in maturity \nand ability to connect with others, and he has no concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s future \nbehavior and ability to protect sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified about Applicant\u2019s work and exceptional \nperformance ratings over the past two years. The witness was not aware of the security \nconcerns alleged in the SOR, or the 2006 and 2017 up-skirting incidents. Applicant \ntestified that the 2006 incidents resulted from depression, and that his up-skirting behavior \nwas not about sex, rather it was about participating in \u201crisky behavior.\u201d He expressed \nremorse and shame for the behavior to which he admitted. He continues to attend \ncounseling and is involved in church activities. However, he also continues to deny his \npresence at or participation in the 2017 up-skirting incident. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13 include: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe evidence in the record supporting the SOR allegations, Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, and testimony are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions listed \nabove. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 are potentially relevant: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program or \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI find the allegations in the SOR credible and consistent with the evidence. \nApplicant acknowledged the 2006 incidents of surreptitiously filming up the skirt of \nunsuspecting women in public, but he denies the 2017 incident despite the \noverwhelmingly persuasive evidence that is sufficient to trigger security eligibility \nconcerns. \nDespite being \u201ccaught on tape\u201d in 2017, Applicant maintains that he was not at the \nstore near the lacrosse tournament, in contravention to the photos and video of him at the \nstore, wearing a shirt that he owns with the display of a college in another state from \nwhich his son attended, and positive identification of his photo from at least 100 friends, \nacquaintances, and coworkers. Applicant\u2019s appears to be more concerned with the \npotential for criminal liability should he admit to activity for which he previously denied. \nHe has shown a pattern of denial, including when confronted by police in 2006, before \nthe evidence literally fell out of his pocket. He continued this pattern of sexual and criminal \nbehavior, resulting in detection again in 2017, and true to form, continues to deny his \nculpability. \nApplicant has shown a history and pattern of reprehensible sexual behavior, \ndespite a criminal conviction and claimed counseling. His blatant, unabashed denials and \nintentional equivocation show a current and continuing failure to take responsibility for his \nactions, and a clever effort to deceive this tribunal and others as to his involvement. I am \nunpersuaded by Applicant\u2019s testimony and his counselors\u2019 evaluations. Applicant \nattempted to avoid responsibility for the 2006 incidents when questioned by police, and \nhe has been less than forthcoming about his involvement in the 2017 incident. The \nevidence is persuasive and Applicant\u2019s denials and claim of \u201ccoincidence\u201d are absurd. \nDespite self-proclaimed counseling, a criminal conviction, probation, a military \nboard of inquiry, and suspension of his security clearance, Applicant continued his \ncriminal behavior and sexual activities against unsuspecting victims. He claimed to have \nlearned from his current counseling sessions, but he failed to offer sufficient evidence of \nhis counselor\u2019s qualifications, specific content of his counseling and treatment, counseling \nrecords, consistency of sessions, and any diagnoses or prognoses. \nDespite calling his counselor to testify on his behalf at this hearing, Applicant did \nnot ask for or grant the witness permission to fully and candidly disclose details of his \ncounseling. Therefore, I am unable to draw reasonable conclusions whether Applicant \nhas successfully completed an appropriate program or treatment in mitigation. \nAdditionally, although Applicant is apparently enrolled in counseling, I am not \nconvinced he has been honest and forthcoming about his past behavior with his \ncounselor. Finally, I am unable to conclude that Applicant demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with an appropriate treatment plan, or that he has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating the behavior is \nreadily controllable with treatment. Clearly, given Applicant\u2019s past sexual behavior, he has \nnot shown that he followed any legitimate treatment plan and his behavior has not been \ncontrolled with treatment. \n9 \n\n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent and recurring. There is insufficient evidence to show \nthat it can be controlled through counseling, or that it has been so controlled. His \nintentional and willful criminal conduct of a sexual nature continues to expose him to the \npossibility of coercion, exploitation, and duress. His actions cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment, and call into question his security eligibility \nworthiness. No mitigating condition applies. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe Security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, anyone of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nconcerning his criminal conduct in 2006 and 2017, are sufficient to establish the \ndisqualifying conditions above. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence in mitigation of the criminal conduct \nconcerns. Applicant was caught by the public in 2006, and he falsified his responses to \npolice until evidence that he denied existed, fell from his pocket. The 2017 criminal \nconduct for which persuasive evidence exists of Applicant\u2019s culpability, is recent and \nremains a concern given Applicant\u2019s refusal to acknowledge even being present at the \nscene. I am incorporating the reasoning discussed above under Guideline D to the extent \nit applies to Guideline J. \nThere is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation despite completing \nprobation from the 2006 incident. The evidence from the 2017 up skirting incident is \npersuasive and points to Applicant\u2019s culpability. Applicant\u2019s character evidence fails to \nmitigate his ongoing criminal conduct. No successful rehabilitation can occur while \nApplicant continues to deny his culpability in the face of convincing evidence. I am \nunpersuaded that similar criminal conduct will not recur. Despite Applicant\u2019s good \nemployment record and involvement with his church, his continued criminal behavior and \ndenials show a concerning pattern and clearly reflect poorly on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. No mitigating condition fully applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines D and J, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military and civilian service, work evaluations, support from his supervisor and \ncounselor, and his years of counseling. I have significant doubts about Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued access to classified information given his pattern and practice of reprehensible \ncriminal behavior and efforts to avoid responsibility. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant or \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n11 \n\n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel  \nFor Applicant: Pro se \nJanuary 25, 2021 \nDecision \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated security concerns regarding his personal conduct and use of \ninformation technology. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 15, 2018, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA). The \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant on December 27, 2019, setting forth one allegation under Guideline \nE and one allegation under Guideline M. The DoD CAF acted under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nin Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. \n10, 2016), effective within the Department of Defense for all adjudicative decisions on or \nafter June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 29, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer). He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On April 28, 2020, the case was assigned to me. The hearing on the case was \ndelayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 1, \n2020, scheduling the hearing for October 29, 2020. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented four \nproposed exhibits marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and an exhibit list, \nwhich I marked as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant offered eight proposed exhibits marked as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through H. Absent any objections, I admitted all of the exhibits \ninto the record. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 10, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his hearing testimony, and \nthe documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old and has been married for 32 years. He and his wife have \nfour children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1987 and two advanced certificates in \n1999. His degree is in a specialized engineering field, and he has worked in the field since \n1987. He has also held a security clearance since 1987, except for an eight-year period \nwhen his employment did not require a clearance. From 2004 until October 2017, \nApplicant worked for a major U.S. Government contractor as an engineering project \nmanager and was granted special access eligibility for a number of years. His \nemployment was terminated for cause in October 2017. As a result, he lost his eligibility \nfor special access. The next month he was hired by another Federal contractor and has \nworked there since as a senior project engineer. With the renewal of his clearance, he \nhopes to regain his special access eligibility. (Tr. at 19-20, 25, 44-45.) \n \n \nAt the time of his termination in 2017, and for a period of four-to-five years before \nthat, Applicant worked in a room in which cellphones were not permitted. An investigation \nrevealed that he had used the instant messaging and email systems on his employer\u2019s \ninternal information technology (IT) systems to communicate personal messages to co-\nworkers that were inappropriate. During the period 2004 through 2017, the investigation \nrevealed a total of 578 improper communications. (Tr. at 21-23, 27-29, 39-42, 45; GE 4 \nat 1.) \n \n \nOften, Applicant\u2019s messages were directly with female co-workers on personal \nsubjects and at times were mutually flirtatious. Some messages were simply \ninappropriate. Other times, he sent messages to a friend at the company that were of a \nsexual nature about female co-workers. Some communications included company profile \npictures of these co-workers. His employer has a written policy stating that its IT system \nis only to be used for work-related purposes. (Tr. at 21-23, 27-29, 39-42, 45; GE 3: GE 4 \nat 4.) \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTo Applicant\u2019s knowledge, no one ever complained that he had engaged in \nharassing behavior. His termination letter makes no reference to harassment. GE 3 \nreferences harassment. There is, however, no specific evidence in the record of \nharassment. Some of his messages were likely perceived by the recipients as \nharassment, such as messages calling the women by pet names or requesting social time \nwhile on business travel. (Tr. at 21-23, 27-29, 39-42, 45; GE 4 at 1-2.) \nPrior to his termination, no supervisor or co-worker ever complained or spoke to \nApplicant about his actions. He was never romantically or sexually involved with any of \nhis co-workers. The employer\u2019s HR department learned about his inappropriate \nmessages and suspended him for two weeks, while it investigated Applicant\u2019s conduct. \nThereafter, he was terminated. (Tr. at 30; GE 3.) \nApplicant advised his wife of the reason for his suspension and termination. He \nrecognized immediately after his termination that he had behaved like an \u201cidiot.\u201d He and \nhis wife received counseling from their church leader. Three months prior to the hearing, \nthey signed up for more formal marriage counselling within their religious tradition. He did \nthis so that he would have a tangible document, AE G, to present at the hearing. He has \nreturned to his traditional faith and takes his religious beliefs seriously. He works hard \nevery day to be a better person for his wife, his family, his employer, and his co-workers. \nHe also strives to better follow the teachings of his religion. (Tr. at 21-23, 27-29, 39-42, \n45; AE G; GE 3; GE 4 at 4.) \nApplicant voluntarily sought individual counseling to better understand his behavior \nthat lead to the termination of his employment. He now realizes that he was being selfish \nand was looking for attention. He has learned to accept full responsibility for the \nconsequences of his actions. He deeply regrets his behavior. He has also learned to \nappreciate fully what he has in his life that is positive, starting with his wife, who he \ndescribed as very religious. She has helped him find his way back to a more pious life. \n(Tr. at 21, 31-35, 46-48.) \n \nShortly after his termination, Applicant was in contact with former co-workers who \npresently work for Applicant\u2019s new employer. He truthfully told them why he lost his job \nand was looking for a new position. He also advised everyone he interviewed with at his \nnew employer why he had been terminated by his former employer. He was given a new \nopportunity to continue working in his field with strict requirements that he be a model \nemployee. He has performed well and has honored his employer\u2019s requirement that he \nnot repeat his past behavior. (Tr. at 33-34.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCharacter Testimony \nTwo witnesses testified at the hearing on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They also provided \ncharacter letters. Both were employees of Applicant\u2019s former employer and knew \nApplicant from having worked with him in the past. Both witnesses were responsible for \nhiring Applicant in his new position. One witness, who is the employer\u2019s deputy general \nmanager and Applicant\u2019s current second-line supervisor, had a serious talk with Applicant \nabout the reasons for his prior termination. Applicant was very candid with him. The \nwitness warned Applicant that such behavior could not be repeated and that there would \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nbe \u201czero tolerance\u201d for any misbehavior. He was never, however, formally put on \nprobationary status. He also advised Applicant that he would need to receive counseling. \nApplicant started counseling at the outset of his employment and has continued up until \nthe present. Applicant works with a number of female employees in his new position. The \nwitness testified that he has received no complaints from anyone regarding Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior. The witness described Applicant as a \u201cvalued employee\u201d whose job \nperformance was \u201cexemplary.\u201d The witness also testified that Applicant was \n\u201cconscientious\u201d and \u201cvery hardworking.\u201d (Tr. at 50-62; AE B; AE C.)  \n \nA second witness testified about Applicant\u2019s character. He is Applicant\u2019s current \nfirst-line supervisor and director of a program supporting the U.S. military. He worked with \nApplicant at their former employer as peers for about 12 years. When they worked \ntogether, the witness had a very high opinion of Applicant. This witness and the other \ncharacter witness made the decision to hire Applicant to work for them at their new \nemployer. They felt that they were not taking any risk in doing so, even after they were \nfully advised by Applicant and his former supervisor about Applicant\u2019s behavior that led \nto his termination in 2017. Based upon their discussions with Applicant, they were \nconfident that Applicant\u2019s past behavior would not be repeated. In the three years that \nApplicant has worked at his new position, he has done a \u201cfantastic\u201d job without any \nproblems. No team members have made any negative comments about Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior. Applicant has been open with this witness regarding the religious counselling \nhe participates in with his wife. (Tr. at 63-68; AE C.) \nWhole-Person Evidence \n \nApplicant also provided his two most recent performance evaluations. They \nestablished that he is a \u201cHigh Performer\u201d (2018) or a \u201cSolid Performer\u201d (2019) He also \nsubmitted three documents that evidence his religious commitment and the support \nsystem he has created to help him maintain his focus on being a better person and more \ndevout, religious person.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.

This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources. \nThe application of the above disqualifying conditions shifts the burden to Applicant \nto provide evidence in mitigation. AG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from personal conduct. Two of them have possible applicability \nto the facts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence fully established both of the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct last occurred three years ago. In light of how he has aggressively \naddressed his efforts to change his behavior and his employer\u2019s zero tolerance for any \nrepetition of his past conduct, it is unlikely to recur. Applicant has made a dedicated and \nconvincing commitment to his wife, family, and religion. Accordingly, I conclude that his \npast conduct does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nMoreover, Applicant has acknowledged the inappropriateness of his past conduct \nand has obtained counseling to change that behavior. His commitment to his counseling \nis sincere and his renewed devotion to his religion will likely be lifelong. His past \nmisconduct is unlikely to recur. Paragraph 1 of the SOR is found for Applicant. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern under this Guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: \nAG \u00b6 40(e): unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nThe application of the above disqualifying condition shifts the burden to Applicant \nto provide evidence in mitigation. AG \u00b6 41 contains four conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from use of information technology. One of the mitigating \nconditions has possible applicability to the facts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 41(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 41(a) is fully established. Applicant\u2019s behavior ceased with his termination \nfrom his former employer over three years ago. Since then, he has taken corrective \nactions to make sure that behavior never recurs. He suffered significant embarrassment \nwith his wife, children, and friends by losing his employment. He was required to relocate \nhis family to a new area. He has sought several different forms of personal and religious \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ncounselling, both with his wife and individually. His new employment strictly requires that \nhis past misuse of information technology never be repeated. None of his past behavior \ncreated a risk to national security. He did not commit a security violation. Applicant\u2019s \nmisuse of information technology is now well in the past. Under all of the circumstances, \nhis conduct does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. Applicant has mitigated security concerns under this guideline. Paragraph 2 of \nthe SOR is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and M in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has established that \nhe has made a serious commitment to change his past misconduct and misuse of \ninformation technology. With the forgiveness and help of his wife, he has made a sincere \ncommitment to his faith and to becoming a better person every day. His new employment \nrequires that he not engage in any misconduct in the workplace, which reinforces his need \nto be responsible and maintain his commitment to change his past behavior. I conclude \nthat Applicant has mitigated security concerns raised by his past personal conduct and \nuse of information technology. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Her admissions \nin her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old pipefitter employed by a defense contractor since \nDecember 2017. She graduated from high school in June 1988 and worked in several \nprivate-sector jobs until she was hired by her current employer. She has never held a \nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant married in August 2016 and separated in February 2018. She has four \nchildren, ages 18, 16, 12, and 8, all of whom live with her. She testified that she is entitled \nto receive court-ordered child support payments of about $500 per month, but she actually \nreceives only about $300 per month. (Tr. 34.) \nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts totaling about $165,000, including a \njudgment for a $11,101 deficiency on a repossessed automobile and a garnishment to \nenforce the judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a); payments on a mortgage loan that are two months \npast due for $1,607, with a total loan balance of $36,215 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); two delinquent \nstudent loans, one placed for collection of $45,205 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and the other past due \nfor $4,679, with a total balance of $66,355 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); 14 delinquent medical bills for \namounts between $110 and $1,210 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.r-1.u); a \nutility bill placed for collection of $702 (SOR \u00b6 1.n); and a cellphone bill placed for \ncollection of $533 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). The delinquent debts are reflected in court records and \ncredit reports from August 2018 and August 2019. (GX 2-5.) \nIn addition to the debts alleged in the SOR, the credit reports from August 2018 \nand August 2019 reflect four delinquent medical debts totaling about $300, and court \nrecords reflect a judgment for about $10,000, entered on January 15, 2020, for furniture \npurchased under a rent-to-own contract two or three years ago.

She attributed many of the medical debts to care \nshe received at a time that she did not have medical insurance. She admitted that the \ndebts were unresolved, and she promised to contact the creditors and collection \ncompanies and make payment arrangements. (GX 6.) \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on January 13, 2020. The \npetition specifically listed the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a 1.b, 1.k, and 1.q, as well as \nnumerous medical providers or their collection agents. Her payment plan was approved \nin March 2020 and provided for payments of $457 for 6 months, then $844 for 41 months, \nand then $895 for 13 months. If she completes the plan, she will have paid a total of \n$49,981. (GX 7 at 61.) The plan includes past-due payments on Applicant\u2019s home \nmortgage, but requires her to continue making the monthly mortgage payments. Applicant \nhas been making the required payments to the bankruptcy trustee by garnishment of her \npay since February 2020. (AX D.) When Applicant failed to make the mortgage loan \npayment for December 2020, the mortgage lender filed a notice of default and requested \nrelief from the automatic stay of foreclosure. (GX 7 at 75-76.) \nApplicant testified that her bankruptcy payment plan includes a $10,000 judgment \nentered on January 15, 2015, for furniture purchased under a rent-to-own contract. (Tr. \n26; GX 8.) However, the furniture vendor was not specifically listed among the creditors \nto be paid under her payment plan. \nApplicant testified that the repossession deficiency alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was \nincurred after she co-signed a loan for a \u201cclose friend,\u201d but they broke up, her friend took \nthe vehicle, and he stopped making payments. Applicant was unable to make the \npayments, resulting in the repossession. (Tr. 14-15, 22-23.) \nApplicant testified that she had contacted her home-mortgage lender and was \nattempting to modify her payment plan to include the judgment for furniture and the \nmonthly mortgage payments, but the modification had not been completed as of the date \nof the hearing. (Tr. 24-26, 32.) \nApplicant testified that she incurred numerous medical debts because she suffered \nfrom an autoimmune disorder that required frequent medical intervention, and the full cost \nof treatment was not covered by insurance. She was not aware that her medical bills had \nbeen referred for collection until around November 2019, when she obtained copies of \nher credit reports in order to prepare her bankruptcy petition.

(GX 4 at 3.) This debt is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. The credit report from August 2019 reflects a student loan assigned to the \ngovernment for collection of $45,205. This debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant testified \nthat she notified the student loan servicer that she had filed a bankruptcy petition and was \ntelephonically informed that no payments would be due on the student loans for five years, \nwhich is the length of the payment plan for her bankruptcy. (Tr. 20-21.) Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy petition lists a debt to the Department of Education for $84,610. (GX 7 at 32 \nand 34.) She submitted copies of entries on a May 2021 credit report reflecting that the \ntwo student loans were included in her bankruptcy petition and were closed. (AX A and \nB.)

However, she was unable to work from March \n3 to July 27, 2020, because of her autoimmune problems and COVID-19 work restrictions, \nand she earned only about $26,000 for 2020. (Tr. 27-28.) Her bankruptcy petition \nreflected that she had about $5,583 in her 401(k) retirement account. (GX 7 at 20.) She \ntestified that she borrowed money from her 401(k) account and payments on the loan \nwere being deducted from her paycheck. (Tr. 29.) Her bankruptcy petition reflects child-\nsupport arrearages totaling about $18,996. (GX 7 at 17.) \nThe debts listed in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition are not the result of extravagant \nspending. She lives modestly in a home described in the bankruptcy petition as a \nmanufactured or mobile home, on which the monthly payments are $793. She drives a \n13-year-old economy car, on which the monthly payments are $387.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant encountered several conditions largely \nbeyond her control: the failure of the co-signer on an automobile loan to make the \npayments on an automobile even though he retained possession of it; a debilitating \nmedical condition; inadequate medical insurance; the impact of COVID-19 on her ability \nto work full time; and the failure of the father (or fathers) of her children to comply with \ncourt orders to pay child support. She acted responsibly by obtaining legal advice, filing \na Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, and complying with her Chapter 13 payment plan. \nWhen she missed two mortgage loan payments, she acted responsibly by contacting the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncreditor and consulting with her lawyer in an effort to add the mortgage loan payments to \nher Chapter 13 payment plan. I have noted that the Chapter 13 payments to the trustee \nhave been collected by garnishment. Payment by involuntary garnishment, \u201cis not the \nsame as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). However, in this case, Applicant initiated the Chapter \n13 bankruptcy, agreed to the payment plan, and appears to have agreed to garnishment \nas the method of insuring timely payments to the trustee. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are established. Applicant completed the financial \ncounseling required by the bankruptcy court and has adhered to her payment plan since \nFebruary 2020. At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had some unresolved issues in \nher financial plan, i.e., the student loans, the past-due mortgage payments, and the \njudgment for furniture. If Applicant completes her payment plan, she will have avoided \npaying the full amounts of some of the debts that she owes her creditors. The degree to \nwhich a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan makes an applicant's creditors whole is a factor that \nan administrative judge is entitled to consider when evaluating whether an applicant is \nacting reasonably to rectify his or her financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 09-03764 (App. \nBd. Apr. 1, 2010) In this case, Applicant\u2019s creditors agreed to the payment plan when it \nwas established. \nThe delinquent furniture bill and past-due mortgage loan payments are yet to be \nresolved. However, the adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make \npayments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, \nor establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a \nplan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). In this case, Applicant has \ndeveloped a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct\u201d that \ndemonstrates a serious intent to effectuate the plan. ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. \nBd. Mar. 9, 2017). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere, candid, and \ncredible at the hearing. She has acted responsibly under difficult circumstances. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His tax professional \nattempted to negotiate an offer in compromise with the IRS for his unpaid taxes. The \nIRS did not accept the offer in compromise because his income was too high. In \nDecember 2020, the IRS filed a $39,738 tax lien against Applicant and his wife for tax \nyears 2013 through 2016.

(Tr. \nat 25-26, 57-58; AE E, F, G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2012 through 2017 federal and state income tax returns \nwhen they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant filed the tax returns at issue in about August or September 2019, and \nhe paid the back federal taxes for 2013 through 2016 sometime between December \n2020 and February 2021. The state taxes have also been paid. AG \u00b6 20(g) is \napplicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This may be true even when the returns have been filed, as an \napplicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline \nto follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or \nher own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018). \nThe most troubling aspect of this case is Applicant\u2019s continued disregard of his \nobligation to file his tax returns and pay his taxes in a timely manner. A man of his age, \neducation, and experience had to know that tax compliance is a requirement of all U.S \ncitizens and residents. Additionally, the DOD kept reminding him of its importance: \nthrough his 2013 interview, his 2018 SF 86, his March 2019 interview, and his \nNovember 2019 SOR. In spite of the \u201creminders,\u201d Applicant did not file the back returns \nuntil August or September 2019; he did not pay the back taxes until sometime between \nDecember 2020 and February 2021; he did not file his 2019 federal and state tax \nreturns until about March or April 2021; and he did not pay the IRS the taxes owed for \n2019 until April 2021. Applicant simply has not convinced me that his history of being a \ntax scofflaw is in the past. I find that security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances \nremain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and the important work he has done over many decades for \nthe United States. Unfortunately, his lax attitude about his taxes has left me with little \nchoice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He has a high school diploma and has earned a number of \nprofessional certifications. He married and divorced once as a young man. He \nsubsequently cohabited with a woman for a number of years and married her in 2008. He \nhas an adult stepchild. (Tr. at 21, 35.) \nAfter graduating from high school in 1991, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force \nwith the intent to serve until his mandatory retirement. He wrote in his SCA that he was \ndischarged in April 1993 under \u201cGeneral Honorable Conditions.\u201d He then wrote \n\u201cDischarge Detail Other Than Honorable,\u201d suggesting that the character of his discharge \nwas Under Other Than Honorable Conditions.\u201d He also wrote in his SCA that the reason \nfor his discharge was a \u201cReduction in forces.\u201d He provided the same reason at the \nhearing. (SCA at18; Tr. at 22.) \nIn his May 2019 background interview (2019 Interview), Applicant disclosed that \nhe was discharged for misconduct. The only detail he said he could recall was the phrase \nconduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. In an April 2016 background interview \n(2016 Interview), Applicant was more forthcoming about his military discharge.

(2019 Interview at 6; 2016 Interview at 13.) \nApplicant attended a class at a junior college when he was a senior in high school. \nDuring the period August 1995 to May 1997, Applicant attended a tech school and earned \ntwo IT certificates of completion. In subsequent years, he was awarded additional IT \ncertifications, mostly through self-study. Since 2014 or 2015, he has worked for a Federal \ncontractor as a systems engineer. He held a security clearance when he served in the Air \nForce. He was not granted an interim security clearance after submitting his SCA in 2015. \nHis employer would like Applicant to have a clearance so that he could work on classified \nmatters, but he can continue his employment at his company without a clearance. It would \nbe helpful to both his employer and Applicant if he had a clearance to work directly on \nclassified contracts rather than around the perimeter in an unclassified environment. \n(SCA at 13; Tr. at 20, 22-24, 27-32.) \nSOR Allegations \nParagraph 1, Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in the two subparagraphs of \nthe SOR under this guideline. In his Supplemental Answer, he specifically denied the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The specific facts regarding each of the allegations are as follows: \n1.a \u2013 Use of marijuana in April and May 2019 \u2013 In his 2019 Interview, Applicant \nreported that he was given an item sample containing ingredients made from cannabis \nby a vendor at an April 2019 Earth Day event. This occurred about a month before the \ninterview. He consumed the product thinking it was a candy and not knowing it was a \nmarijuana edible (Edible). This was the first time he ever consumed \u201cmarijuana,\u201d using \nthat term broadly to include all products derived from marijuana. At the event, which is \ngenerally associated with marijuana, Edibles were for sale. Applicant claimed that the \nitem he consumed was not labeled to show that it contained marijuana. He later learned \nthat he had consumed an Edible. He testified it was not his intent to consume marijuana \nor a marijuana product when he attended this event. (Tr. at 36-39; GE 2 at 9.) \nIn his 2019 Interview, Applicant further reported that his wife subsequently \npurchased more Edibles at a cannabis dispensary in Applicant\u2019s home state where the \nsale of such products is legal under state law. Applicant deliberately consumed Edibles a \nfew more times after his first experience with Edibles. At the time of the 2019 Interview \non May 21, 2019, he was still consuming Edibles. He said that was taking the Edibles to \nease shoulder pain and to sleep better at night. He intended to see his doctor in the near \nfuture \u201cto get a note for this.\u201d At the time of the Interview, Applicant acknowledged that he \nwas aware that Edibles were not legal under Federal law. (GE 2 at 9.) \nApplicant provided additional information in his October 2019 responses to \nDOHA\u2019s Interrogatories about his past use of Edibles.

The approximate dosing was 2.5-5 mg.\u201d (GE 2 at 3-4, \n19, 21-22.) \nIn his January 2020 Answer, Applicant confirmed that he consumed Edibles in April \nand May 2019 to help him sleep after \u201cexcessive periods of time when [he was] unable to \nsleep.\u201d He wrote that his decision to consume Edibles was made out of \u201cdesperation.\u201d He \nwrote further: \nI have, as intended, engaged with my primary care physician in exploring \nFDA approved medications to assist with my incremental sleep problems. \nMy primary care physician and I are exploring medications to resolve sleep \nissues that do not leave lingering effects the following day that could \npotentially affect my work performance.   \nAnswer at 1. \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that he consumed the Edibles in 2019 under \nextraordinary circumstances. He experienced significant pain in his shoulder due to a \nwork-related injury and was unable to sleep for about three days. He ate the Edibles to \nhelp him sleep on two or three occasions while he was waiting to see his workers\u2019 comp \ndoctor.  He made a point that he only used a \u201cquarter\u201d of the \u201cstandard dosing\u201d in the \nsquare Edible and that his use was infrequent and an \u201cisolated incident.\u201d He waited \u201ca \nvery short period of time\u201d to see his workers\u2019 comp doctor, an orthopedist.  The doctor \ngave Applicant a prescription for his pain. The medication helped him sleep without using \nthe Edibles. He also made a comment about how long it takes to be seen by a workers\u2019 \ncomp doctor, which was inconsistent with his earlier testimony that he had an \nappointment with that doctor after only waiting a short time. Also, he provided no \ntestimony regarding his primary care physician or that doctor\u2019s role in \u201cexploring \nmedications\u201d with Applicant.  (Tr. at 40-50, 56.) \nApplicant has not used Edibles since May 2019, the month of his 2019 Interview. \nDuring the period when he was unable to sleep, Applicant did not consider the option of \nseeing a doctor at a 24-hour healthcare facility. Applicant believed that was not a viable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noption because he assumed that this type of doctor would tell him to take Tylenol for his \npain. He did not believe that an over the counter drug like Tylenol would be sufficiently \nhelpful for his condition. Applicant confirmed at the hearing that he knew at the time he \nconsumed the Edibles that it was not legal to do so under Federal law and that it was \nagainst his employer\u2019s drug policy. He also confirmed that he understood that at the time \nof his use of the Edibles, he was under consideration for a security clearance. In \nexplaining his thought process at the time he consumed the Edibles, he provided a \ncurious analogy between marijuana and alcohol, stating that they have \u201cpretty much the \nsame restrictions\u201d and both are \u201ccontrolled.\u201d  He made the same point in his post-hearing \nsubmission (AE A), writing that: \u201cedibles are available to the general public in an over the \ncounter fashion just like alcohol.\u201d He noted at both the hearing and repeated in AE A his \nwife had leftover prescription pain medication and that he chose not to take the medication \nsince the prescription was not written for him. He commented in AE A that \u201cprescription \npain killers are controlled substances that are not publicly available in an over the counter \nfashion, like alcohol.\u201d He argued that he made the better choice by using Edibles, not the \nleftover pills, to relieve his pain. Applicant was unaware at the hearing that marijuana is \na Schedule I controlled substance under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, even \nthough, as noted, he knew that marijuana was illegal under Federal law. (Tr. at 45, 48-\n50, 54-56; AE A at 2.)    \n1.b \u2013 Expressed intent to continue using marijuana in the future \u2013 In his 2019 \nInterview, Applicant also made the statement that he may consider taking Edibles in the \nfuture if needed for pain. He advised that he was going to see his doctor in the near future \nand to get a \u201cnote\u201d for using Edibles. In response to the Government\u2019s interrogatories, \nApplicant was given the opportunity to correct any errors in the report of his 2019 \nInterview, and he made a number of corrections. None of his corrections addressed his \ncomments about his intention to use Edibles in the future. (GE 2 at 9, 18-20.) \nIn his Answer, Applicant explained that his comment about future use made during \nhis 2019 Interview was made \u201cwith the caveat of only under extreme circumstances, such \nas having not slept for upwards of 72 hours, and only in the event of a delay in interacting \nwith my primary care physician to help resolve the problem.\u201d He wrote further: \nSince the time of my interview no further use has occurred as my primary \ncare physician was able to see me in a very expedited manner and begin \naddressing the problem. \nAnswer at 1. In his Supplemental Answer, Applicant specifically answered SOR allegation \nin subparagraph 1.b by stating: \u201cI deny that I have intent to use marijuana in the future.\u201d \n(Supplemental Answer at 1.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant discussed further the \u201cnote\u201d he wanted his doctor to \nprovide, which he discussed in his 2019 Interview. He explained that he wanted the doctor \nto write \u201csomething to state that it was a pertinent solution to the immediate problem,\u201d that \nbeing his lack of sleep due to shoulder pain.

He also reaffirmed his \ndenial of the allegation regarding future intent to use illegal drugs. (Tr. at 47, 50-51, 56-\n60.) \nDuring closing argument, Applicant and I engaged in a lengthy discussion about \nhis failure to provide a signed statement pursuant to AG \u00b6 20(b)(3) that set forth both his \nintent to abstain from using illegal drugs in the future and an acknowledgment that any \nfuture drug use by him would be grounds for the revocation of his national security \neligibility. He said he did not submit such a statement because he expected the \nGovernment to provide him with an appropriate form for that purpose. After the hearing, \nhe provided a signed statement of his intent to abstain from any future drug use. He also \nwrote: \u201cAdditionally, I do understand that these infractions are grounds for revocations of \nsecurity clearances issued by the U.S. government.\u201d (Tr. at 105-111; AE C.) \nParagraph 2, Guideline M, Use of Information Technology \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in the one subparagraph of the \nSOR under this guideline. The specific facts regarding this allegation are as follows: \n2.a \u2013 Purchase and use in August 2015 of an external USB WiFi card \u2013  \nApplicant answered the following question in his SCA in the affirmative: \nSection 27- Use of Information Technology Systems \nUnauthorized Access \nIn the last seven (7) years have you illegally or without proper \nauthorization accessed or attempted to access any information technology \nsystem? \nIn response to the follow-up questions in his SCA, Applicant disclosed that in August 2015 \nhe \u201cpurchased an external USB WiFi card while at Defcon [sic] and have been learning \nhow to use Kali Linux.\u201d \nAt his 2016 Interview, Applicant discussed the above admission in his SCA. He \nstated that in addition to the two items described, he also purchased a directional antenna. \nHe said that these items are typically used to break into password-protected wireless \ninternet networks. The antenna can be aimed to receive WiFi signals as far away as two \nmiles. He explained that Kali Linux is software used to overcome password protection on \nWiFi systems. He admitted that the unauthorized entry of a secure computer system \nwould be a violation of law. He has never tried to access the WiFi system of a corporate \ncomputer system. He has only attempted to enter WiFi systems that appear to him to \nbelong to individuals.

In response to a separate question in DOHA\u2019s \ninterrogatories, he acknowledged as correct the following statement: \n1.

(GE 2 at 15-16, 24.) \nApplicant also reported in his 2016 Interview that he has taken the equipment to \nparties at homes of his friends and has allowed them to use the equipment. He said he \ndoes not recall if any of his friends were able to enter a secure WiFi network, but he was \nnot certain of that. (GE 2 at 15.) \nIn his October 21, 2019 responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant was given \nthe opportunity to correct any errors in the reports summarizing his 2016 and 2019 \nInterviews. He made a few minor corrections, but made no changes to the portions of the \n2016 Interview report summarized above. He then affirmed that the interview summaries \nattached to the Interrogatories were accurate as corrected and adopted the statements. \nHe signed his interrogatory responses before a Notary Public. (GE 2 at 4, 25-26 \nAt the hearing, Applicant provided extensive testimony about his involvement in \nDEFCON and his purchase and use of the hacking equipment. Applicant and his wife \nhave attended an annual IT security conference call DEFCON since 2010 or 2011. They \nbecame volunteer staff members of DEFCON in about 2015. The conference is an \nimportant venue for IT security professionals to stay current on developments in their \nfield. (Tr. at 29-33.) \nApplicant testified that in 2015, at the DEFCON conference in Las Vegas, he \npurchased an external USB WiFi card, which gets plugged into a computer and can be \nused to identify WiFi networks available in the area for connection. He explained that all \ncomputers and phones use an internal WiFi card to perform this function. The external \ncard he bought not only has a USB connection to connect to a computer, it also has an \nantenna port that is used to connect to an external antenna. That is the only difference of \nthe external WiFi card he purchased. The card he purchased came with an antenna. As \na staff member of DEFCON, he purchased the equipment at a discounted price. With the \naddition of an antenna, he is able to conduct a directional search for available WiFi \nnetworks. He testified that he purchased the equipment for \u201ccontinuing education.\u201d \nQuoting Sun Tzu, he wanted to \u201cknow thy enemy,\u201d meaning that he wanted to better \nunderstand the capabilities of hackers who use this type of hacking equipment to break \ninto computer networks. He wanted to use the hacking equipment to see if he could gain \naccess to password protected networks. To get through a password protection WiFi \nnetwork, he needed to download a \u201csuite\u201d of software called Kali Linux and use one of \nthe programs in the suite.

In the process of trying, he was \nlearning how the tools work. He blamed his lack of success on his lack of expertise \nworking with Linux software. He attempted to use the tools at his apartment after the \nconference. The antenna had a stated range of two miles, but Applicant explained that \nthe quality of the data transmission was poor at longer distances. His next-door neighbor\u2019s \nWiFi network would certainly be within reach of the antenna and software. He initially \nclaimed he used the hacking tools over a day or two, but then he immediately modified \nthis statement saying he limited his use to one time for 30-45 minutes before dinner time. \nWhen asked if he had used the hacking equipment since that time, he responded: \u201cNot \nto my recollection.\u201d He also limited the target networks into which he sought to gain entry. \nHe testified that he only \u201cpicked something that said \u2018guest.\u2019\u201d Subsequently, Applicant \ntried to explain what he meant by the word \u201cguest\u201d as something different than a business \nowned and managed WiFi system. In his post-hearing submission, he repeated his claim \nthat he only \u201cselected for testing networks containing \u2018Guest\u2019 in their SSID [Service Set \nIdentifier or wireless network name],\u201d and he did \u201cnot believe . . .

He explained that he is \u201cnot part \nof that team\u201d that works on accessing password-protected WiFi networks. When asked if \nhe understood the Government\u2019s security concerns regarding the illegality of trying to \naccess password-protected networks without authorization, Applicant responded, \u201cI \nunderstand that there is verbiage about it.\u201d When asked if he has any aspirations to be a \nhacker, he responded: \n\u201cHacker\u201d is a lot of different terms . . .

That \ntype of thing is hacking. \n(Tr. at 80-82.) \nApplicant also testified that most of his friends who work in IT positions are far \nmore knowledgeable than he is with respect to security matters. He agreed that he \u201cmay \nhave taken [the hacking tools] to a get-together [with his IT friends] once . . .

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer establish \nthe following condition under AG \u00b6 25 that could be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from substance misuse. Two of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n11 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n      \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s use of an illegal drug happened\nabout two and one-half years ago and was infrequent. Applicant believes that the\ncircumstances under which he took Edibles to relieve pain were highly unusual, which\njustified his illegal actions. While I have difficulties with the credibility of much of \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and his demeanor at the hearing, I conclude that his drug use is \nunlikely to recur if he were granted a security clearance.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore significantly, I find the circumstances under which Applicant used Edibles \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. While he was under \nconsideration for a security clearance and was being investigated in connection with his \napplication, he made a deliberate choice to violate federal law when he felt it was justified \nby his personal circumstances to do so. This judgment and behavior are antithetical to \nthe requirements of a security clearance holder. A person entrusted to safeguard and \nprotect national security matters cannot put his personal interests ahead of his legal \nobligation to comply with the criminal laws of the United States. As discussed further \nbelow, this type of judgment is part of a pattern of decisions made by Applicant in which \nhe chose self-interest over judicious and wise behavior. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant has acknowledged his use of Edibles in April \nand May 2019 and has established a pattern of abstinence. A doctor has prescribed pain \nmedication for Applicant\u2019s injured shoulder, and he does not intend to use illegal drugs in \nthe future to self-medicate so that he can sleep. Also, he has provided a signed statement \npursuant to AG \u00b6 20(b)(3) declaring his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39 as follows: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer potentially \nestablish the following conditions under AG \u00b6 40 that could be disqualifying: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; and \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nAG \u00b6 40(a) and 40(c) are partially established. Applicant claims that he did not \nsuccessfully enter another person\u2019s information technology system. I am not convinced \nthat this claim is credible. As an IT professional working with other IT professionals who \nwere expert in Linux software, Applicant had sufficient resources available to him to learn \nhow to use the Kali Linux software to successfully enter a password protected network. \nHe testified that he only attempted to use the software on one brief occasion. In his \nDecember 2015 SCA, he wrote that he has \u201cbeen learning how to use Kali Linux,\u201d which \nhe obtained months earlier. Ultimately, it is not important whether Applicant was \nsuccessful in his hacking activities or not, the security concerns about his judgment raised \nby his conduct in seeking to enter private networks remains and is potentially \ndisqualifying. \nAG \u00b6 40(e) is established. At the hearing, Applicant used vague language to avoid \ndiscussing whether his use of his information technology system, consisting of his \ncomputer, the Kali Linux software, and the equipment he purchased at DEFCON, was \nlegal. His testimony was inconsistent with his admission in his 2016 Interview that an \nunauthorized entry into a computer system would be a violation of law. He did, however, \nacknowledge both in his SCA and in his testimony that his use of his system was not \nauthorized. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 41 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from the use of information technology. Two of these mitigating \nconditions have possible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness. \nAG \u00b6 41(a) is only partially established. A number of years have elapsed since \nApplicant engaged in this behavior. There was nothing unusual about the circumstances \nunder which he admits he attempted to break into the WiFi networks of computer systems \nbelonging to others, except for the unusual fact that he did this. Applicant may or may not \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nattempt to repeat this behavior in the future. Given Applicant\u2019s disregard for whether his \nactions were legal and his acknowledgement that his actions were unauthorized, it is \nentirely p\n ossible that he may decide that he wants to explore this technology further at a\nfuture date, which raises the primary issue in this case: Applicant\u2019s judgment. As with his\nillegal use of marijuana for his personal interests, he made the same poor judgment\nbuying and using this hacking equipment. He had an excuse for doing so, i.e., to educate\nhimself in the technology, just as he had an excuse to violate a criminal law using Edibles.\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s behavior using the hacking equipment casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41(b) is only partially established. The frequency of Applicant\u2019s use of the \nhacking equipment may have been minor, but the nature of his poor judgment in doing \nso was hardly minor. Moreover, his actions were not done solely in the interest of \norganizational efficiency and effectiveness. He admitted in his testimony that he did not \nwork in the security area of his employer\u2019s business, and in particular, was not involved \nin WiFi security. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the pertinent adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and Guideline M in my whole-\nperson analysis and considered the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional \ncomments are warranted. Applicant is a mature, 49-year-old engineer with a responsible \nposition. When he used Edibles to self-medicate, he was not a young person with limited \nexperience in a work environment. He knew that his use of an Edible violated his \nemployer\u2019s drug policy and was illegal under Federal law. He exercised very poor \njudgment at that time. In 2015, he also exercised very poor judgment trying to use \ntechnology equipment for an unauthorized, and likely illegal, purpose. His poor judgment \neven extends back to his days in the Air Force when he was prematurely separated due \nto his actions. Perhaps most concerning were Applicant\u2019s repeated attempts to minimize \nand recharacterize his actions. I found much of his testimony about important facts in his \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncase to strain credibility. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s demeanor and wordy responses in his \nattempts to explain his actions and judgment created serious questions about his \nreliability and trustworthiness. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his drug involvement and misuse of information technology. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \n Subparagraph 2.a  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 36 years old. He has never been married and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and his master\u2019s degree in 2011. In 2007, he started employment with a federal contactor, and in 2012, he was granted a DOD security clearance. His current job title is advanced lead engineer and his annual salary is approximately $110,000. (Tr. 8, 26; GE 1) Financial Considerations The SOR alleges Applicant failed to file his 2016, 2017, and 2018 Federal income tax returns. He also failed to file his state income tax returns for the same years. He admitted both SOR allegations (\u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.b) Applicant stated in his response to the SOR that the reason he fell behind on filing his Federal and state income tax returns was due to his taxes becoming complicated. This stemmed, in part, from both a rental property and him becoming part owner of a family business. He expected tax refunds for all three years, and mistakenly believed that he had three years to file the income tax returns in order to receive his Federal and state tax refunds. In early 2020 he hired an accountant who was working on filing these specific Federal and state income tax returns. (SOR Response; Tr. 41-42) During the hearing, Applicant testified that he had purchased a house in early 2008. Instead of selling the house when he moved out in 2013, he chose to turn it into a rental property. There were years that he made about $12,000 - $14,000 in annual income from this rental proper",

He now uses a professional tax service to prepare his complicated income tax \nreturns. He does not owe any back taxes. In addition, he has recovered from a toxic \nrelationship that ended in 2013 with his former girlfriend, who had filed a protection order \nagainst him. He has not had any contact with her since she filed the protection order, \nwhich expired nearly three years ago.

He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 17, 2021. On \nMay 25, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing, setting the hearing for June 17, 2021. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, and Applicant provided two documents, which I labeled as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A and B. All proffered documents were entered into evidence without objection. I \nheld the record open for two weeks, until July 1, 2021, in the event Applicant wanted to \nsubmit additional documentation after the hearing. Applicant timely submitted four \ndocuments, which I labeled AE C, D, E, and F. I admitted all proffered exhibits into \nevidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 30, 2021, \nand the record closed July 2, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old. He has never been married and has no children. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and his master\u2019s degree in 2011. In 2007, he started \nemployment with a federal contactor, and in 2012, he was granted a DOD security \nclearance. His current job title is advanced lead engineer and his annual salary is \napproximately $110,000. (Tr. 8, 26; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to file his 2016, 2017, and 2018 Federal income \ntax returns. He also failed to file his state income tax returns for the same years. He \nadmitted both SOR allegations (\u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.b) \nApplicant stated in his response to the SOR that the reason he fell behind on filing \nhis Federal and state income tax returns was due to his taxes becoming complicated. \nThis stemmed, in part, from both a rental property and him becoming part owner of a \nfamily business. He expected tax refunds for all three years, and mistakenly believed that \nhe had three years to file the income tax returns in order to receive his Federal and state \ntax refunds. In early 2020 he hired an accountant who was working on filing these specific \nFederal and state income tax returns. (SOR Response; Tr. 41-42) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he had purchased a house in early \n2008. Instead of selling the house when he moved out in 2013, he chose to turn it into a \nrental property. There were years that he made about $12,000 - $14,000 in annual income \nfrom this rental property, and there were other years the house sat vacant while he \nremodeled the bathroom and finished other projects on the home. Overall, he has not \nmade much money from the rental property, and as of the date of the hearing, he was \nplanning to put the rental property up for sale within the next month or two. When \npreparing his Federal and state income tax returns for 2016, he realized he had some \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe other tax complication Applicant encountered was related to being gifted in \n2017 with six percent ownership of a family business. His aunt operated two ice cream \nkiosks in a large out-of-state mall. In 2017, he received quarterly checks of $6,000, or \n$24,000 annual revenue for his six percent ownership. In 2018, major renovations were \nmade on the kiosks, which impacted his earnings. This and other business situations \naffected his Federal and state income taxes. He used Turbo Tax software, but he did not \nfeel comfortable that he had prepared his income tax returns correctly. He realized that \nhe again needed professional tax assistance to report his income correctly to the Federal \nand state tax authorities. (Tr. 30-32, 37, 42) \n \n \nIn early 2020, Applicant hired an accounting service to prepare his delinquent \n2016, 2017, and 2018 state and Federal income tax returns, and to prepare his income \ntax returns for 2019 as well. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) transcripts \nin the record, in June 2020, Applicant\u2019s 2019 and 2018 Federal income tax returns were \nfiled. Applicant\u2019s 2016 Federal income tax return was filed in June 2021. Applicant stated \nthat he made a tax payment to the IRS in June 2018 due to the income he earned from \nthe family business in 2017. There was confusion about the tax payment, which was \nactually recorded as Applicant filing his 2017 Federal tax return in June 2018, based on \nthe IRS transcript in evidence. The accounting service saw that his 2017 Federal tax \nreturn was listed as \u201cfiled\u201d in the IRS database. The accounting service assumed he had \nfiled all of his income tax returns for tax year 2017, so they did not process his newly \nprepared state income tax return for 2017. Applicant was not aware of this until he \nreceived notification last year from the state tax authority that his 2017 income tax return \nhad never been filed. (Tr. 44-52; AE C)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he initiated contact with a professional tax service before \nhe received the SOR. He provided documentation which showed the accounting service \nhad prepared the 2017 state income tax return in May 2020. In June 2021, he received a \n2017 state tax refund of $348. The accounting service also prepared his 2016, 2018, and \n2019 state income tax returns in May 2020. Applicant received tax refunds for all of these \ntax years. He also provided documentation from the accounting service showing that he \nfiled his 2020 Federal and state income tax returns in June 2021. He intends to continue \nusing the tax accounting service to prepare his complicated income tax returns in the \nfuture. He will receive a Federal tax refund of $2,733 and a state tax refund of $941 for \ntax year 2020. All unfiled Federal and state income tax returns alleged in the SOR have \nbeen filed and fully resolved. Applicant lives within his means and does not have any \nother financial delinquencies, to include any delinquent state or Federal taxes.

(Tr. 28-30) \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that in August 2013, Applicant received a complaint from a \nformer girlfriend that he was stalking her, harassing her, and ignoring her boundaries. The \ncourt issued a temporary ex-parte civil order of protection. At a later hearing where \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation that he received the protective order, but not \nnecessarily the alleged inappropriate or criminal conduct alleged in the protective order \nin his response to the SOR, and he also provided additional information during the hearing \nabout the circumstances of this toxic relationship. He stated that his former girlfriend \nthreatened to kill herself repeatedly, harassed him with constant e-mails, phone calls and \nmessages, and texts from unknown phone numbers. He denied that he stalked her, \nharassed her, or threatened her with violence. He showed up to court to respond to the \nprotection order without any evidence of her communications, since she had deleted most \nof them from his phone, and without the benefit of a lawyer. Since August 2013, the time \nthe civil protection order was granted, he has had no contact with his former girlfriend. \nThe protective order expired in August 2018. He has never had any other adverse issues \nwith law enforcement.

(\u00b6 2.a; GE 2, GE 3; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAppellant\u2019s failure to file Federal and state income tax returns for three consecutive \nyears (2016-2018) support the application of AG \u00b6 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAppellant knew he was required to timely file his state and Federal income tax \nreturns. He encountered tax complications stemming from a rental property and income \nearned from a family business. He prepared his tax returns on Turbo Tax software, but \nhe did not file them because he was uncertain of their accuracy. He decided he needed \nprofessional advice from a tax accounting service. He also discovered that he had up to \nthree years to file his 2016, 2017, and 2018 income tax returns and still be qualified to \nreceive a tax refund. Although he was incorrect about having three years to file his tax \nreturns, and he delayed in hiring the tax accounting service, he did act responsibly by \ncontacting an accountant to get his tax returns filed before receipt of the SOR. \nThe tax accounting service prepared Applicant\u2019s Federal and state income tax \nreturns for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. All of his Federal and state tax returns \nhave been filed and all of his tax issues are now settled. Under the current circumstances, \nthere are clear indications that Appellant\u2019s tax problem is resolved. His failure to timely \nfile his Federal and state income tax returns for three consecutive years occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \n \nIn August 2013, a civil protection order was initiated by Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend \nagainst him for inappropriate behavior. The court continued the protection order until \nAugust 2018, which supports the application of AG \u00b6 16(d)(2). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth a potentially applicable mitigating condition under \nGuideline E: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant admitted the protection order was issued against him by the court in \nAugust 2013. He was involved in a toxic relationship with a former girlfriend that turned \naccusatorial and confrontational. He denied the criminal conduct alleged in the protective \norder. The court ordered him to have no contact with his former girlfriend during the five-\nyear period of the protection order. Applicant has fully complied with these terms and the \nprotection order expired in August 2018. He has not had any adverse contact with law \nenforcement. He was never arrested for violating the protective order. I find that the toxic \nrelationship was a unique situation that is not recent. Time has shown that the incident is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Personal Conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline E and the AG \u00b6 2(d) \nfactors in this whole-person analysis. \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his or her off-duty conduct or \ncircumstances can have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the \napplicant's national security eligibility. \nTo his credit, Applicant took responsible action to file his 2016-2018 Federal and \nstate income tax returns by contacting an accounting service before receipt of the SOR. \nHe does not owe any back taxes. He used the services of a tax accounting service to \nhandle his complicated tax returns, and he intends to continue using their services in the \nfuture. He ended a toxic relationship with his former girlfriend, and he has not had any \ncontact with her since she filed a protection order against him, which expired nearly three \nyears ago. He has not been involved in any similar incidents or had any adverse contact \nwith law enforcement. After evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility.

In support of the Government\u2019s SOR amendment, Department \nCounsel submitted records from the federal bankruptcy court where Applicant filed her \nChapter 7 petition. The most recent report of Applicant\u2019s credit history submitted by \nDepartment Counsel did not contain any adverse financial information. (GX 1 \u2013 7) \nApplicant and her husband have been married since October 2017. Previously, \nbetween 2010 and 2016, she was in a relationship with a boyfriend with whom she has \none child.

The debt at SOR 1.c is for \na cash advance against Applicant\u2019s credit card. Applicant loaned the money to her ex-\nboyfriend\u2019s mother to pay for medical expenses in 2016. The mother never repaid \nApplicant for either loan. Applicant herself was not able to stay current on either account. \nBoth debts were discharged through bankruptcy.

Applicant co-signed the auto loan for that \ncar with her ex-boyfriend. When he stopped making the monthly loan payments after they \nbroke up, the car was repossessed. Applicant was saddled with the remaining obligation \nbecause her ex-boyfriend did not earn enough money to pay his debts. Between October \n2019 and June 2020, when she filed her bankruptcy petition, her pay was involuntarily \ngarnished to satisfy this debt at a monthly rate of about $400. This debt was discharged \nthrough bankruptcy. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 6; Tr. 27, 40 \u2013 42, 60 \u2013 62) \nApplicant incurred the credit-card debt at SOR 1.d in April 2016 when she and her \nex-boyfriend broke up and vacated the apartment they shared. The expenses associated \nwith cleaning and repairing the apartment fell to Applicant. She used that credit card to \ncover the costs but was unable to make the necessary payments on the account. This \ndebt was discharged through bankruptcy. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 6; Tr. 47 \u2013 48) \nThe debt alleged at SOR 1.e is for a delinquent cable television and internet \naccount. Applicant asserted that this debt was paid a few years ago. This debt was not \nincluded in her bankruptcy petition and does not appear on the most recent credit reports \nprovided by both parties. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 7; AX B; Tr. 48) \nThe debt at SOR 1.f is for a delinquent cellphone account. Applicant switched from \none carrier to a new carrier, but she could not afford the early termination fees imposed \nby the carrier listed in SOR 1.f. This debt was discharged through bankruptcy. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; GX 6; Tr. 49) \nThe debt at SOR 1.g is also for a delinquent cable television account; however, \nApplicant thought that this debt had previously been resolved. This debt was not included \nin her bankruptcy petition and does not appear on the most recent credit reports provided \nby both parties. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2 \u2013 7; AX B; Tr. 49 \u2013 50) \nApplicant acknowledges that the debts and financial problems addressed in the \nSOR arose primarily from her poor financial decisions while she was in a relationship with \nher child\u2019s father. Also contributing to Applicant\u2019s financial problems was an unalleged \nmortgage foreclosure. In 2010, Applicant\u2019s father convinced her to co-sign a mortgage \nwith him because neither he nor his wife had sufficient credit to obtain a mortgage on their \nown. Applicant\u2019s father assured her that within three years, he would refinance the \nmortgage and remove Applicant\u2019s name from the loan. Her father did not follow through \non his intention. The mortgage went into foreclosure in 2019 when Applicant\u2019s father lost \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2019, Applicant sought legal advice about how she might resolve her delinquent \ndebts, particularly the car repossession debt at SOR 1.a and her liability for her father\u2019s \nmortgage. At the time, her personal finances were characterized by a negative monthly \ncash flow of about $154. On her attorney\u2019s advice, she filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy as \nalleged in SOR 1.h. Through that process, Applicant relinquished a vehicle even though \nshe was always up to date on the purchase loan. In its place, she purchased another \nused car and she has been current on that loan at all times. Although she earns just under \n$20 and hour, her current finances are sound. She meets all of her current monthly \nobligations and has incurred no new unpaid debts. She now has about $15,000 in regular \nsavings and another $4,000 in a retirement savings account. She and her husband \ntogether earn about $70,000 annually and have an estimated $1,000 remaining each \nmonth after expenses. A former landlord provided a written statement that Applicant was \ncurrent on her rent between December 2019 and January 2021. (Answer; GX 6; GX 7; \nAX A; AX B; AX D; Tr. 29 \u2013 35, 50 \u2013 53, 55 \u2013 56) \n \n \nApplicant is well-respected by her personal and professional associates. She has \na reputation for generosity and professionalism. Her child\u2019s father and grandmother each \nprovided written statements corroborating Applicant\u2019s assertions about the debts at SOR \n1.a \u2013 1.c. They also expressed their positive views regarding Applicant\u2019s character, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s father also provided written corroboration of \nhis actions regarding Applicant\u2019s involvement with his mortgage.

(Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX F; Tr. 27, 36 \u2013 39, 57 \u2013 \n59) \nPolicies \nSEAD 4, Appendix A, Paragraph 1(d), requires that a decision to grant eligibility \nfor a position of public trust must be \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity.\u201d All such adjudications must adhere to the procedural protections in the Directive \nbefore any adverse determination may be made. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, \nand commonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and \nmaterial information, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies \nin the adjudicative guidelines. (Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of \nthe following factors, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, listed in the \nguidelines at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nWhen applying the adjudicative guidelines, the presence or absence of a \ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. Nonetheless, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them \nas they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of eligibility for a position \nof trust. \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a position of trust for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one is entitled to a position of \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. A person who has access to \nsensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on \ntrust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect sensitive information as his or her own. Any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access should be resolved in favor of the Government. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant accrued nearly $25,000 in debt that became delinquent starting in 2016. \nHer debts remained unresolved until 2020, when she was discharged of her debts through \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. This information reasonably raised a trustworthiness \nconcern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s information requires \nconsideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were the result of her own poor decisions when she \nwas asked to financially assist people close to her \u2013 the father and grandmother of her \nchild, as well as her own father. She also accepted that it was her responsibility to resolve \nthose debts to the best of her ability. Nonetheless, others\u2019 failure to repay Applicant, her \nfather\u2019s failure to refinance the mortgage as he said he would, and Applicant\u2019s status as \na single mother making just under $20 an hour together amount to circumstances beyond \nher control that culminated in onerous financial burdens. In response to those \ncircumstances, Applicant liquidated her debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Her decision \nin this regard was not intended to evade responsibility for her debts; rather, under these \ncircumstances it was the most prudent option available to her and was taken on advice \nof legal counsel. Applicant already was meeting all of her current monthly obligations \n(e.g., rent, car loan, etc.), and she had not accrued any new unpaid debts other than \nthose listed in the SOR; however, she had no foreseeable way to resolve her past debts. \nSince the completion of her petition, Applicant has continued to manage her personal \nfinances without difficulty. She and her husband earn sufficient income to pay their bills \nwhile still having money remaining each month for contingencies.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nAll of the foregoing supports application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nand 20(c). Available information shows that the trustworthiness concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are mitigated. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). More specifically, I note the favorable information about Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter, as well as about her finances before, during, and after her Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole \nsupports a conclusion that the trustworthiness concerns raised by the Government\u2019s \ninformation are now mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to occupy a position of public trust. Applicant\u2019s request for public \ntrust eligibility is granted. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Applicant bought a van, and then added more until he \nhad nine vans. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the business, and he lost \nall but one van. (Tr. at 21-24, 33-36; GE 1, 2, 4) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts with balances totaling about $26,700. \nApplicant admitted that he owed all of the debts. All of the debts are listed on a \nSeptember 2018 combined credit report. Three of the debts became delinquent in 2013 \nor earlier. The telecommunications debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($129), 1.e ($2,209), \nand 1.f ($1,284) were reported by TransUnion and Experian as becoming delinquent in \n2015, 2016, and 2018. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6) \nApplicant retained the services of a credit repair company. He has not made any \npayments toward any of the SOR debts. He asserted that the debt for the balance on an \nauto loan after the car was repossessed was paid through the sale of the car and \ninsurance (commonly referred to as gap insurance). He stated that two of the \ntelecommunications companies \u201cbasically stole [his] money.\u201d He was told by other \ncreditors that the debts could not be located, and there is nothing else to be done. None \nof the debts are listed on the 2020 Equifax credit report or the 2021 combined credit \nreport. Those reports show no accounts with balances. (Tr. at 36-45; GE 5-7; AE A) \nApplicant stated that his finances could be better, but they are currently in good \ncondition. He testified that he had about $14,500 in his bank account. He did not pay all \nthe federal incomes taxes due for tax years 2012 and 2014.1 He stated that he received \nletters from the IRS about six months before the hearing. IRS tax transcripts indicate \nthat as of June 14, 2021, he owed $1,104 for tax year 2012 and $4,973 for 2014. \nApplicant stated that he planned to pay his taxes, but it was difficult to get anyone from \nthe IRS on the phone. He paid the taxes owed for both years on June 23, 2021. (Tr. at \n48-54; AE D) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2018. He did not report any financial or tax problems. He discussed his finances \nand several of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, but there is no indication that he \never told the investigator about his delinquent taxes. He admitted he owed back taxes at \nhis hearing when specifically asked by Department Counsel. (Tr. at 51; GE 1, 2) \n1  The SOR did not allege that Applicant owed back taxes. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR \ncannot be used for disqualification purposes. It can be used to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, in \ndetermining the applicability of mitigating conditions, and during the whole-person analysis. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing\nthat information or technology. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and her husband are residents of Iraq. His oldest sister is a \nresident of Iran. The potential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens \nremains high in Iraq, and it continues to have human rights problems. The concerns \nabout Iran are well known, and are even greater than Iraq. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts \ncreate a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions \nhave been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq and Iran. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who served honorably in the U.S. military and \nworked overseas under dangerous conditions in support of the national defense. He \ncredibly testified that his family in Iraq and Iran could not be used to coerce or intimidate \nhim into revealing classified information. The Appeal Board has stated that such a \nstatement, standing alone, is of limited value, unless there is record evidence that the \napplicant has acted in a similar manner in the past in comparable circumstances, or that \nthe applicant has a previous track record of complying with security regulations and \nprocedures in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a \nsignificant contribution to the national security. See, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), \nthe Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nI find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant used some of the money he earned working overseas to start a \nbusiness in 2009. The business was successful for a period, and then was undercut by \na larger competitor. He incurred debts that he was unable to pay in an unsuccessful \nattempt to keep the business afloat until he sold it in 2012. That was followed by periods \nof unemployment and underemployment. Those events were beyond his control. \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are apparently better, as reflected by his recent \ncredit reports. The Appeal Board has noted that the fact that a debt no longer appears \non a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the \ndisposition of the debt. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04802 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, \n2016). He testified that he had about $14,500 in his bank account, but he never paid \nany of the SOR debts. Moreover, the first time he mentioned any unpaid taxes was \nwhen he was specifically asked about them at the hearing. He paid the 2012 and 2014 \nfederal taxes after the hearing. The timing of resolution of financial problems is an \nimportant factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant \nwho takes action to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice his or \nher clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment, and self-discipline to follow rules \nand regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own \ninterests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are not applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(e) are partially \napplicable. I find that financial considerations concerns remain despite the presence of \nsome mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and his work overseas in support of the U.S. \nmilitary. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns, but he did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

National security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 22, 2018. On \nNovember 8, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 6, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On February 18, 2020, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nincluding pleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 8. He \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceived the FORM on February 27, 2020. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant requested and received continuances \nwith the following extended deadlines: April 11, 2020; May 14, 2020; June 19, 2020; \nAugust 6, 2020; August 30, 2020; and September 11, 2020. Applicant\u2019s documents were \nreceived by DOHA on September 17, 2020. The case was assigned to me on September \n27, 2020. I marked Applicant\u2019s document as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, pages 1 through \n63. Items 1 through 8 and AE A are admitted into evidence without objection.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 68 years old. He has been divorced since 1995, and he and his ex-\nwife have three adult sons. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981. He has worked as \na senior analyst for defense contractors since 1995, and he has worked for his current \nemployer since February 2009. He enlisted in the Air Force in 1971 and received an \nhonorable discharge in 1983, when he was commissioned as an officer. He retired \nhonorably in 1994. He has held a security clearance since at least 2008, and he held a \ntop secret clearance when he served in the Air Force. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 6) \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file, as required, his 2018 federal income \ntax return. He denied that he failed to timely file, as required, his 2014 through 2017 state \nincome tax returns, but admitted to failing to file his 2018 state income tax returns in a \ntimely manner. He admitted to owing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $9,910.45 for \ntax years 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016, but claimed he entered into a repayment \nagreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in January 2018. In his December \n2019 answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed he was paying $1,000 monthly, but he did \nnot include proof of any payments. Finally, he admitted to gambling losses of $65,000, \nwhich caused him to fall behind on his mortgage and other financial obligations, but \nclaimed he had stopped gambling. (Item 1; Item 3) \n \nIn his August 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that \nhe failed to pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. \nHe also disclosed that he was almost $20,000 delinquent on his mortgage. He fell behind \non his mortgage and tax obligations due to gambling losses and helping family members \nwith their finances. He averaged his gambling losses to be $10,000 a year for an unstated \nnumber of years. Applicant claimed he was working with the IRS to establish a repayment \nagreement, and he was working with his mortgage holder to reach a loan modification \nagreement. Because Applicant\u2019s delinquent mortgage debt was not included in the SOR \nas a separate allegation, I will consider it only in relation to his gambling losses and to \nevaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. (Item 4 at 32-28) \nDuring his December 2018 and January 2019 personal subject interviews (SI), \nApplicant told the government investigator information consistent with his SCA \ndisclosures. He gambled to try and increase his funds, and his gambling caused financial \nissues between January 2012 and August 2018. He needed additional funds because of \nthe financial help he provided to his family. He told the Government investigator that there \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis no chance he would gamble in the future due to the problems gambling had caused \nhim. He provided the Government investigator copies of February 2016 and November \n2018 loan modification agreements for his primary mortgage. (Item 6) \nIn his July 2019 response to CAF interrogatories, Applicant included Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) tax transcripts for tax years 2011 through 2017 and state \ntranscripts for tax years 2011 through 2013. The state transcripts did not indicate when \nhe filed the relevant returns, but Applicant asserted that his state income tax returns were \nfiled every year with his federal income tax returns. He also claimed he was working with \nthe IRS to establish a repayment agreement, but he did not provide proof of a current \nrepayment agreement, past repayment agreements, nor proof of any payments to any of \nthe agreements. Between 2011 and 2019, Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was \nbetween $141,330 and $174,673. (Item 5, AE A) \nApplicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return on July 16, 2012. The June 2019 \nIRS transcript reflects no evidence that he filed for an extension, nor did he pay the \noutstanding taxes that were due at that time. Additionally, the transcript shows that he \nentered into installment agreements in March 2014, September 2014, March 2017, and \nJanuary 2018, but no payments were made. In his response to the FORM, Applicant \nprovided an August 2020 tax transcript, reflecting an outstanding balance of $.03. His \npayments totaling $1,343.79 were made between April and July 2020. (Item 5 at 9-11; \nAE A at 4-5, 37) \nApplicant filed his 2012 federal income tax return on May 13, 2013, and his tax \ntranscript reflects no evidence that he filed for an extension. He overpaid his taxes, and \nthe residue of $654 was applied to tax year 2007. (Item 5 at 12-13) \nApplicant filed his 2013 federal income tax return on June 2, 2014. The June 2019 \nIRS transcript reflects no evidence that he filed for an extension, nor did he pay the \noutstanding taxes that were due at that time. Additionally, the transcript shows that he \nentered into installment agreements in September 2014, March 2017, and January 2018, \nbut no payments were made. In his response to the FORM, Applicant provided an August \n2020 tax transcript, reflecting an outstanding balance of $87.06. His payments totaling \n$2,481.80 were made between June and August 2020. (Item 5 at 14-16; AE A at 7-8, 37) \nApplicant filed his 2014 federal income tax return on August 3, 2015, and his tax \ntranscript reflects no evidence that he filed for an extension. He overpaid his taxes, and \nthe residue of $90 was applied to tax year 2002. (Item 5 at 17-19; AE A at 9-15) \nApplicant filed his 2015 federal income tax return on February 27, 2017. The June \n2019 IRS transcript reflects no evidence that he filed for an extension, nor did he pay the \noutstanding taxes that were due at that time. Additionally, the transcript shows that he \nentered into installment agreements in March 2017 and January 2018, but no payments \nwere made. In his response to the FORM, Applicant was unable to provide an updated \ntax transcript, nor did he provide evidence of payments toward the outstanding balance \nof $2,776.95. (Item 5 at 20-22; AE at 16-22) \n3 \n\n \nApplicant filed his 2016 federal income tax return on July 2, 2018. The June 2019 \nIRS transcript reflects no evidence that he filed for an extension, nor did he pay the \noutstanding taxes that were due at that time. Additionally, the transcript shows that he \nentered into an installment agreement in June 2018, but made no payments. In his \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant provided an August 2020 tax transcript, reflecting an \noutstanding balance of $3,653.91. He entered into an additional installment agreement in \nNovember 2019, but did not provide proof of payments.

He overpaid his taxes, and the residue of $177 \nwas applied to tax year 2002. (Item 5 at 17-19; AE A at 25-31) \nApplicant indicated in his September 2020 response to the FORM that the IRS \nsent him a letter informing him that it has an open identity theft case for tax years 2014, \n2015, and 2017. As a result, he could not submit updated account transcripts for these \ntax years; however, he did not provide a copy of the IRS letter. Additionally, in his \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant provided a copy of his 2018 IRS tax transcript. Applicant \nfiled his 2018 federal income tax return on September 16, 2019, and there is no evidence \nthat he filed for an extension, despite his assertions in his answer to the SOR. Applicant\u2019s \nAugust 2020 tax transcripts reflects an outstanding balance of $11,111.24. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to pay this tax debt was not alleged in the SOR; therefore, I will consider it only to \nevaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. Applicant filed his 2019 federal and \nstate income tax returns on July 1, 2020, in a timely manner, and paid the amount due to \nthe IRS. He received a refund from his state. (AE A at 2, 32-33) \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided a history of payment activity \nreflecting all of the payments he made to the IRS in the last five years, not including tax \nwithholding. There is no evidence that he made any payments before January 2020, when \nhe started making $1,000 payments. Almost $4,000 of the total payments Applicant made \nthis year were applied to tax year 2010. Because Applicant\u2019s delinquent 2010 federal \nincome taxes were not included in the SOR as an allegation, I will consider it only to \nevaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. Applicant\u2019s state tax records reflect \nthat he does not currently owe any outstanding income tax debts for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2019. The records he provided do not demonstrate when the 2011 through 2018 \nreturns were filed. (Item 5; AE A at 37-56) \nDespite claims in his January 2019 SI that he had quit gambling and did not intend \nto gamble in the future, Applicant admitted in his October 2020 response to the FORM \nthat \u201cI have not gambled in months\u2026.\u201d This statement indicates he continued to gamble \ndespite his declarations that he made in his August 2018 SCA, January 2019 SI, and \nDecember 2019 answer to the SOR that he no longer gambled. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 6; \nAE A at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s January 2020 credit bureau report indicated his mortgage was past due \nin the amount of $10,600, and foreclosure proceedings had been initiated. In his FORM \nresponse he provided documentation demonstrating he entered into a trial mortgage \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmodification plan on January 31, 2020, which became permanent in May 2020. He \nprovided proof of an October 1, 2020 automatic draft from his bank account. There is no \nevidence in the record that Applicant has obtained credit counseling or currently follows \na written budget. (Item 8; AE A at 57-64) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).

Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201cSecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that are disqualifying. The following are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to fund \ngambling or pay gambling debts; and \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by \ngambling. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(f), \nand 19(i). Applicant failed to make any payments toward his 2011 and 2013 federal \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nincome taxes until the summer of 2020, six to eight months after the SOR was issued and \nmonths after he received the FORM. He continues to owe over $6,000 to the IRS for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016. He provided documentation that he has filed his state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 through 2018, but based upon his claims that he filed his state \nreturns at the same time he filed his federal income tax returns, these returns were all \nfiled late, and he provided no evidence of extensions. Applicant admitted to falling behind \non his mortgage and tax obligations due to $65,000 in gambling losses that were incurred \nbetween 2012 and 2018. It is unclear from the record evidence where he obtained the \nmoney for these losses; however, there is no evidence that he borrowed money or \nengaged in significant financial transactions to support his gambling habit; therefore, AG \n\u00b6 19(h) is not applicable in this case. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s IRS tax transcripts reflect that his failure to pay his federal taxes \nextends back to at least 2002, and includes tax years 2007 and 2010. He also owes over \n$11,000 for his 2018 federal income taxes, demonstrating that his tax issues were not \ninfrequent, but have been ongoing since 2002, and they continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The tax transcripts also reflect that he \nconsistently filed his federal and state income tax returns late every year between 2011 \nand 2018, further demonstrating his lack of good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues were not the result of illness, loss of employment, \ndivorce, or other conditions that were beyond his control, rather they were caused by his \ngambling problem. Despite his multiple claims that he no longer gambles, it is clear from \nthe evidence that it is an ongoing problem. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe payments Applicant has made since the SOR was issued do not demonstrate \na good-faith effort to resolve his debts. Between August 2018, when he completed his \nSCA, and January 28, 2020, when he made his first payment to the IRS, Applicant made \nno demonstrable effort to resolve his tax debt, despite being confronted in December \n2018 during his SI. Although he provided evidence that he has been in a repayment plan \nsince January 2020, the IRS tax transcripts reflect a consistent failure to make payments \nunder all of his multiple previous installment agreements that he entered into between \n2014 and 2019. Applicant\u2019s history of failing to abide by these agreements significantly \noutweighs his recent payments. Additionally, his history of failing to file his state and \nfederal income tax returns, in a timely manner, is outweighed by his recent efforts, which \nwere initiated after the SOR and FORM were issued to him. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(d), and 20(g) was not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns raised by his gambling history and outstanding federal \ntaxes. The record lacks sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he is reliable, trustworthy, \nand exercises good judgment. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United \nStates to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n8 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant\u2019s girlfriend was pregnant with another man\u2019s child. About five \nmonths after her child was born, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend sent her baby son to live with her \nparents in China. Applicant\u2019s close relationship and cohabitation with his girlfriend \nmade her aware of his background investigation and the fact that he was applying for a \njob with the U.S. government. Applicant underwent a Counterintelligence screening \nwith the U.S. Army on April 2019. During that screening, which asked him about \ncontact with any foreign national, he disclosed his Chinese-national landlords, but failed \nto mention his girlfriend. \n(Government Exhibit 5.) \nApplicant also failed to list his \ngirlfriend as a foreign contact or a cohabitant on his April 2019 security clearance \napplication. (Government Exhibit 4.) It was not until May 2019 during his personal \nsubject interview that he admitted to living with a Chinese citizen since November 2017. \n(Government Exhibit 8.) It was about this time that Applicant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s parents came \nto visit their daughter along with her young son. Applicant met his girlfriend\u2019s parents \nbut never revealed the relationship to his own family and friend because he did not want \nthem to know he was dating a Chinese woman who was pregnant when they met. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR indicates that he ended the relationship with his \ngirlfriend in July 2019, when he deployed to Afghanistan to work as a linguist. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nApplicant is indebted to five creditors listed in the SOR, totaling in excess of \n$53,000. He admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports dated April 27, 2019, and May 27, 2020, confirm this \nindebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 6 and 7.) \nIn October or November 2017, after becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant started a \nfood truck business with a friend. To fund the project, Applicant took out a personal \nloan in the amount of $30,000 from one lender, and a personal loan in the amount of \n$15,000 from another lender. (Government Exhibit 8.) The business failed within a few \nmonths. Applicant\u2019s business partner, his friend, returned to Afghanistan. \nShortly \nthereafter, Applicant defaulted on both personal loans. He was also unable to pay his \ncredit card bills. \nSince then, Applicant has been unable to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. \nHe believes that his job as a linguist will allow him to pay his debts. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s financial distress became apparent after his failed business. The \ndebt became overwhelming, and he stopped making payments on his debts. He tried \ncalling a debt relief company, but thought it was a scam and never followed through. \nHe has made no attempt to repay the debt. He states that he plans to pay his debt \nwhen he starts earning more money. \nThe following debts set forth in the SOR became delinquent and are of security \nsignificance: 2.a. A credit card account was charged off in the amount of approximately \n$4,323. 2.b. A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of approximately \n$750. 2.c.

In 2001, the United States led a coalition to \nremove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains an important \npartner with the United States in the fight against terrorism, and has been designated a \nMajor Non-NATO Ally. However, numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the \nU.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Afghans. Even with \naggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Afghanistan \nremains high. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as state \nintelligence services. In summary, Afghanistan provides a significant and heightened \nsecurity risk to the United States.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$3,648. 2.d.

The United States faces a continuing threat to its national \nsecurity from Chinese intelligence collections operations. More than 90 percent of its \nstate-backed economic espionage cases and two\u2013thirds of its theft of trade secret \ncases involve China. China presents a persistent cyber espionage threat and a growing \nattack threat to our core military and critical infrastructure systems, and China remains \nthe most active strategic competitor responsible for cyber espionage against the U.S. \nGovernment, corporations, and allies. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country; \n(d) counterintelligence information, whether classified or unclassified, that \nindicates the individual\u2019s access to classified information or eligibility for a \nsensitive position may involve unacceptable risk to national security; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s immediate foreign family relatives include his mother, father, seven \nbrothers, and four sisters who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s \ngirlfriend and cohabitant is a citizen of China. Applicant\u2019s foreign connections pose a \nsignificant security risk. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and three of them are applicable in this case. \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these person are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant has thirteen immediate family members who are citizens and residents \nof Afghanistan. \nApplicant has had regular, consistent contact with all of them, \nespecially with his parents, until sometime between April 2019 and January 2020. \nApplicant now claims that he has no contact with his family at any level, and gives no \nexplanation for this change or if he plans to resume contact. \nApplicant\u2019s close \nrelationship with his family members and the conditions in Afghanistan present a \nheightened risk that Applicant could be exploited, induced, manipulated, pressured, or \ncoerced into acting against the interest of the United States. There is no evidence in \nthe record to support mitigation in this instance. Under the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s \nforeign contacts in Afghanistan do pose a heightened security risk for the United States \nGovernment. \nApplicant relationship with his girlfriend, a Chinese citizen, from November 2017 \nto July 2019 is also very concerning. Applicant admits that she was aware of his \nongoing background investigation and the fact that he intended to deploy as a linguist \nsupporting the U.S. Army. He failed to identify her as a close and continuing foreign \ncontact on his security clearance application, and during his Counterintelligence \nscreening investigation, despite disclosing his Chinese-national landlords. Applicant \nalso concealed his relationship with his Chinese girlfriend from his own family and \nfriends, apparently concerned that they may not approve. This vulnerability is evident \nand most concerning as it could present a situation where he could be susceptible to \ncoercion or exploitation from foreign parities or blackmailed for the benefit of China. \nUnder the circumstances, Applicant has failed to meet his burden, and Guideline B is \nfound against the Applicant. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant is excessively indebted totaling more than $53,000. He has not paid \nback the two personal loans he obtained to start a business in 2017, and has not been \nable to pay off several delinquent credit card debts. Each of the debts listed in the SOR \nremain owing. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude that he is \nfinancially stable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has financial resources \navailable to pay his past-due financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control, namely a failed business, \ncontributed to his financial problems. \nHe took our personal loans and incurred \nexcessive debt that he has not been able to pay. Today, four years later, he remains \nexcessively indebted. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant has even made \nany attempt to pay his debts, as he has shown no significant progress. There has been \nno change to his finances for several years. Applicant has not demonstrated that he is \nin control of his finances or that he can pay his bills. \nUnder the circumstances, \nApplicant has failed to meet his burden. None of the mitigating conditions set forth \nabove under Guideline F provide full mitigation. This guideline is found against the \nApplicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has not shown that he is qualified for access to classified information. His \nclose foreign contacts with family members in Afghanistan; the nature of his relationship \nwith his Chinese girlfriend, and his attempt to hide her from the Government; and his \nexcessive indebtedness, preclude him from security clearance eligibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence and Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b . \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.e. \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n12/03/2020 \nDecision \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by the alleged criminal behavior but failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his recent marijuana-related charges and use of marijuana while \nholding a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on June 30, 2018. On \nApril 9, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nalleging security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The DOD acted under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 14, 2020, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing.

On September 10, 2020, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM,) which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6, was sent to \nApplicant. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his \nreceipt to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on September 21, 2020, and responded \non October 8, 2020. The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are marked as Administrative \nExhibit 1. The case was assigned to me on November 12, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about January 2006 until December 2018, and from about July 2016 until \nDecember 2018 while holding a security clearance. The SOR further alleges that in March \n2006, August 2016, and November 2017 Applicant was charged with possession of \nmarijuana. Applicant admits each of these allegations with explanations. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleges the marijuana-related allegations and \nalso alleges that Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) \nin May 2009. Applicant admits this allegation with an explanation. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant, 34, is a contract specialist employed by a defense contractor since May \n2009. He worked for the same defense contractor as a summer intern between May and \nAugust 2008. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. He has held a security clearance \nsince August 2008. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nApplicant used marijuana recreationally between January and March 2006. In \nMarch 2006, he was charged with possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor. He \ncompleted a drug education course and the charge was dismissed. (GX 3; Answer.) \nIn May 2009, Applicant was charged with DUI, a misdemeanor. He was admitted \ninto the state\u2019s pre-trial alcohol education system and successfully completed a 10-class \nalcohol intervention program. The DUI charge was dismissed in December 2009. (GX 3; \nAnswer.) Applicant asserted in his PSI that he never consumes alcohol before driving. \nThere is no record evidence of any additional alcohol-related charges or misconduct. \nAccording to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7844, simple drug possession, to include marijuana, is a \nmisdemeanor under federal law. The amount required to constitute simple possession is \nnot delineated in the statute. A first-offender can be sentenced to a term of imprisonment \nof not more than one year, a minimum of $1,000 fine, or both. However, if an offender is \nconvicted of simple possession after a prior drug-related offense has become final, the \noffender can be charged with a felony simple possession offense. \nIn 2011, the state where Applicant resides decriminalized marijuana. While still \ntechnically illegal, possession of less than one half ounce of marijuana is treated as a civil \noffense punishable by a fine. In 2012, the state enacted a law allowing certain individuals \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlegal access to medical marijuana. According to the state\u2019s Department of Consumer \nProtection (DCP) website, the law sets forth the specific medical conditions for which \nmedical-marijuana use has been approved. In order for a person to legally use medical \nmarijuana, a physician must certify that the person has a medical condition that qualifies \nhim or her for a medical-marijuana registration certificate. The person must then make \napplication to the DCP for a medical-marijuana certificate. Without such a certificate, \npossession and use of marijuana remains illegal. \nIn July 2016, Applicant began smoking marijuana to help alleviate the pain from \nflare-ups of a medical condition. The marijuana use also helped him reduce his prescribed \nmedications which have serious long-term-use side effects. He smoked marijuana \napproximately 20 times between July 2016 and December 2018. He stopped using \nmarijuana because he did not want to jeopardize his employment. Applicant has not made \napplication to the DCP for a medical-marijuana certificate. (GX 4.)  \nIn August 2016, Applicant and his friend went to a bar in a neighboring state. \nApplicant\u2019s friend drove, and was pulled over by the police after leaving a bar. The police \nofficer asked Applicant and his friend if there is anything in the vehicle that the officer \nshould know about. Applicant and his friend each surrendered approximately one gram \nof marijuana. The officer gave them each a citation for $125 for possession of marijuana \nand a summons to appear in court. Marijuana is decriminalized in this state. Applicant \nhired an attorney who appeared on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The charge was deferred for 13 \nmonths during which time Applicant was required not to be cited for any additional \nmisconduct. Applicant complied and the charge was dismissed. (GX 4.) \nIn November 2017, Applicant was pulled over in his state of residence for failure \nto maintain his lane. According to Applicant, the officer asked Applicant if there was \nanything in the vehicle that the officer should know about, and Applicant surrendered a \nbag containing approximately one or two grams of marijuana. (GX 4.) However, the \nofficer\u2019s incident report states that the officer\u2019s partner approached Applicant\u2019s vehicle \nand observed \u201ca few grams [of marijuana] in a jar on his backseat.\u201d (GX 5.) The officer \nissued Applicant a summons for leaving the lane of travel and for possession of \nmarijuana, one ounce or less. Applicant appeared in court and the two charges were \ndismissed. (GX 4; GX 5.) \nIn December 2017, Applicant obtained a letter from his physician that stated that \nthe physician had referred Applicant for medical-marijuana therapy for a \u201crecognized \nmedical condition.\u201d The letter set forth Applicant\u2019s diagnosed medical condition, however, \nthe delineated condition is not included in the list of medical conditions approved for \nmedical-marijuana use. (GX 5.) \nIn his January 2019 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant stated that he has \nnot used marijuana since December 2018, has no intention of future use of marijuana, \nand does not associate with anyone who uses it. In his November 2019 responses to \ninterrogatories, Applicant stated under oath that he did not intend to use illegal \nsubstances in the future.

Instead, Applicant referenced the December \n2017 letter from his physician referring Applicant for medical marijuana therapy. \nAdditionally, in his response to the FORM, Applicant discussed his medical condition and \nset forth a list of side effects caused by his prescribed medications. He also attached two \nphotographs depicting the medical condition and a copy of the December 2017 letter from \nhis physician. \nIn his PSI, Applicant stated that he did not list his then ongoing marijuana use on \nhis June 2018 e-QIP because it was for \u201cmedical purposes\u201d which was acceptable in his \nstate of residence. In response to Section 22 \u2013 Police Record of the e-QIP, Applicant \nlisted his August 2016 possession of marijuana charge by citation number and docket \nnumber and stated that the case was dismissed in December 2016. He checked that the \noffense involved alcohol or drugs, but did not disclose the actual charge of possession of \nmarijuana. He listed his November 2017 possession of marijuana charge in the same \nmanner. There is no evidence that Applicant reported either the 2016 or 2017 possession \nof marijuana charges to his facility security officer. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by the record evidence, establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution . . . ; \nand \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions may also apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nApplicant admits to using marijuana approximately 20 times between July 2016 and \nDecember 2018 while holding a se\n  \ncurity clearance. He j ustifies his use b\n y claiming th\n \nat it \nwas for medicinal purposes and that medical marijuana use is legal in his state of \nresidence. In support of this, Applicant provided a December 2017 letter from his physician \nreferring Applicant for medical marijuana therapy for his medical condition. Applicant also \nstated that he stopped using marijuana in December 2018 because he didn\u2019t want to \njeopardize his employment. \nDuring his 18 months of marijuana use while holding a security clearance, Applicant \nwas charged with possession of marijuana on two occasions. He did not report either \nincident to his facility security officer. When completing his e-QIP in June 2018, Applicant \nwas still actively using marijuana. He did not disclose his ongoing marijuana use on his e-\nQIP. He stated that he did not list his use because it was for medicinal purposes which \nwas legal in his state of residence. He did disclose his 2016 and 2017 citations as alcohol \nor drug-related charges, but listed only the citation numbers and docket numbers but did \nnot list that the charges were for possession of marijuana. \n6 \n \nIn his January 2019 PSI, Applicant asserted that he had no future intention of using \nmarijuana and that he no longer associated with anyone who used it. His responses to \nDOHA\u2019s November 2019 interrogatories included a signed, sworn assertion of Applicant\u2019s \nintention not to use marijuana or any other illegal drugs in the future. However, Applicant \ndid not restate his intention of no future use of marijuana in his answer to the SOR. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConversely, in his admission to the SOR allegation he used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about January 2006 to about December 2018, Applicant cited the letter \nfrom his physician referring Applicant for medical marijuana therapy. In his response to the \nFORM, Applicant attached a copy of the letter from his physician and photographs of his \nmedical condition. He also described the side effects from long-term usage of his \nprescribed medications to treat his medical condition. \nApplicant has repeatedly asserted that his use of marijuana was legal because it \nwas for medicinal purposes which is legal in his state of residence. This argument fails \nfor several reasons. First, the use of marijuana violates federal law. Second, while the \nuse of medical marijuana is legal under the state law of Applicant\u2019s residency, Applicant \ndid not have a qualifying medical condition during his recent period of marijuana use. \nAdditionally, Applicant made no attempt to register for medical-marijuana-use \ncertification. Despite Applicant\u2019s personal reason for using marijuana, without medical-\nmarijuana-use certification, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was recreational and in violation of \nstate law as evidenced by his 2016 possession of marijuana charge. While marijuana is \ndecriminalized in both states where Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana \nin 2016 and 2017, the fact that he was charged with these violations should have made \nhim realize that his conduct was against the law. \nApplicant asserts that he stopped using marijuana in December 2018, nearly two \nyears ago. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the \nevidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn considering the totality of the evidence, particularly Applicant\u2019s age and length \nof time as a security-clearance holder, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was \nrecent and casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nFurther, given his ongoing justification for his marijuana use as medicinal, I find it likely to \nrecur despite his signed, sworn statement of no future intention of marijuana use. \nApplicant has not met his high burden of persuasion and has not mitigated the Guideline \nH concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nI have considered the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted. \nTo constitute a pattern of minor offenses that gives rise to a concern about a \nperson\u2019s overall judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, there must be some discernable \ninterrelation between the acts or incidents that is reflective of the person\u2019s overall \ncharacter. Following the 2006 and 2009 charges, Applicant modified his behavior and \nthere is no record evidence that Applicant participated in any illegal conduct for more than \n10 years. Applicant\u2019s recent instances of marijuana possession and use occurred while \nApplicant was acting under the misconception that his use of marijuana for medicinal \npurposes was legal. He did not act with criminal intent. Taken together, these incidents \ndo not constitute a pattern of criminal conduct as contemplated by this Guideline. While \ntechnically Applicant\u2019s behavior can be assessed under Guideline J as criminal conduct, \nI conclude that it is more appropriate to evaluate under Guideline H, as set forth above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and J in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant was not forthcoming about his recent marijuana-related charges and did \nnot disclose his marijuana use on his e-QIP. The fact that he has held a security clearance \nsince 2008 cuts both ways for Applicant. On the one hand, he has held a clearance for \n12 years without any evidence of any incidents. On the other hand, as a security-\nclearance holder, he is held to a high standard and knew or should have known his \npossession and use of marijuana violated federal law and the conditions of his security \nclearance. His recent conduct continues to cast doubt on his security-clearance \nworthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nJ and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The \nSOR explained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn December 30, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegation and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On May 12, 2020, the Government submitted a File \nof Relevant Material (FORM), including six items consisting of its documentary evidence. \nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, and instructed him that any response \nwas due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on July 2, 2020. On July \n29, 2020, he submitted a response dated July 12, 2020. On July 30, 2020, Department \nCounsel indicated that the Government had no objection to consideration of Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM. \nOn August 24, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. I received the case file on September 2, 2020. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 5 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on May 2, 2017, and follow-up \ncontacts with Applicant on May 5, 2017, May 12, 2017, and September 5, 2017. The \nsummary report was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following important notice: \nImportant Notice to Applicant \nThe enclosed summary of your [PSI] (exhibit 5) is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence \nin this case. In your response to this [FORM], you can comment on \nwhether the summary accurately reflects the information you provided \nto the authorized investigator(s) and you may make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear \nand accurate.

If no objections are raised in your \nresponse to this FORM, or if you do not respond to this FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any \nobjections to the admissibility of the summary and may consider the \nsummary as evidence in your case. \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant referenced the employment issues detailed \nin the PSI in the context of discussing mitigating circumstances for his conduct. He raised \nno objections about the accuracy of the PSI. He expressed some concerns about the lack \nof informed judgments and the \u201chearsay, if not improperly and unfairly worded\u201d statements \nof those who reported his behavioral issues at work and in college, but it is not clear that he \nwas objecting to the PSI. Rather, he cited some specific concerns with respect to \ninformation reported in records reviewed by a licensed psychologist for the DOD as \nreferenced in a psychological evaluation report. (Item 6.) He did not dispute the reported \nbehaviors exhibited by him but asked that they be considered as incidents overcome, \nstating: \nThough these judgments come from periods of time prior to [his involvement \nwith his present employer], they nonetheless grasp at points that, when \nclarified and corrected, offer information highly relevant to any summative \njudgment: of [his] judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nAfter considering Applicant\u2019s comments, I accepted Items 1 through 6 in evidence, \nwith the weight afforded the information in the PSI (Item 5) and the psychologist\u2019s \nevaluation report (Item 6) to be evaluated in light of the record evidence as a whole. \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM was admitted as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR (Item 1) alleges under Guideline I that Applicant was diagnosed by a \nlicensed psychologist in January 2019 with high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder \nwithout accompanying intellectual impairment and with generalized anxiety; that Applicant\u2019s \ncondition affects his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness; and that he has a fair \nprognosis (SOR \u00b6 1.a).

He seeks a security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome as a youth. That condition is \ncurrently diagnosed as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) under the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th  Edition (DSM-5). ASD is properly diagnosed \nwhen there are persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across \nmultiple contexts, as manifested by deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (e.g., abnormal \nsocial approach; reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; or failure to respond to \nsocial interactions), and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities, as \nmanifested by two or more of stereotyped or repetitive motor movements; insistence on \nsameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of nonverbal behavior; \nhighly restricted, fixated interests abnormal in intensity or focus; or hyper- or hypo-activity \nto sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment. According to the \nDSM-5, symptoms of ASD cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, \nother important areas of current functioning. Even those persons whose symptoms are \nleast severe (Level 1) require some support to manage their deficits in social \ncommunication or their restricted, repetitive behaviors, which cause significant interference \nwith functioning in one or more contexts. See the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th  Edition (May 2013). As a high-\nfunctioning individual with ASD without accompanying intellectual impairment, Applicant \nprefers the DSM-4\u2019s designation of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome for his disability and submits that \nit can be compensated for throughout life.

His father died in October 2019 following a period of \ndeclining health that started in December 2018. (AE A.) \nApplicant lived on campus during academic semesters while in college from August \n2009 to May 2013. (Item 5.) He had counseling in college, reportedly due to his \u201codd \nbehaviors\u201d and for not performing up to his perfectionist expectations. (Item 6.) He held \nsummer internships in 2010 and 2012 with his county\u2019s board of elections where his father \nworked. He worked as a receptionist and then associate in his college\u2019s art gallery to fulfill a \nwork-study scholarship requirement during the academic semesters from 2010 to 2013. He \nmoved back in with his parents after he graduated from college in May 2013 and was \nunemployed until he began working as a groundskeeper for his current employer in March \n2015. He also volunteered part time at a bird sanctuary starting in July 2014. (Items 4, 6.) \nOn May 22, 2015, Applicant completed and executed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) in application for a security clearance for a position as a mail \nclerk for his employer. He responded negatively to whether he had consulted with a health \ncare professional for an emotional or mental health condition in the last seven years. (Item \n4.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \nOn May 2, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant disclosed that he had received written \nreprimands from his employer in 2016 for being chronically late to work; that he was \nreprimanded after he intentionally banged his head on a dumpster when he lost or \nmisplaced his identification badge; and that he was suspended from work after becoming \nupset about retrieving a leaf blower near the end of his shift. He explained that he felt \nstressed at the time, which he attributed to his Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. Applicant also \ndisclosed that he had consulted with a counselor during his senior year of college. During a \nsubsequent contact with the investigator on May 5, 2017, Applicant explained that the \ncounseling in college was for anxiety related to school and social issues. When re-\ncontacted by the investigator on May 12, 2017, Applicant explained about his work incident \ninvolving the leaf blower that he became upset because it was near the end of his shift, and \nthe weather was deteriorating.

The \npsychologist reviewed some records provided by the DOD CAF, interviewed Applicant, and \nadministered a Psychological Assessment Inventory to him. (Item 6.) \nApplicant told the psychologist that he had not had any counseling for his ASD since \ncollege, but that he has been taking an anti-depressant for the past several years to help \nhim with his moods and behavioral outbursts. Applicant acknowledged his history of \nreprimands at work for tardiness and emotional outbursts, although he also reported some \nimprovement lately on those issues. The psychologist observed that Applicant had some \ndifficulty articulating his thoughts, and while he was pleasant, he was anxious and \nfrequently requested her feedback about his performance. When asked whether he had a \nmental health problem, Applicant admitted he had social anxiety and some addictive \nbehaviors. He disclosed that when he becomes upset with himself, he feels stressed, and \nthat he had engaged in self-harming behaviors in the past, including banging his head and \npoking himself with a sharp object. Applicant denied attempting any self-injurious behavior \nsince the incident at work where he was reprimanded by his employer. He reported that he \nis easily distracted, has experienced anxiety about his future, and does not cope well when \nhis routine is disrupted or when he feels uncomfortable. The results of the Psychological \nAssessment Inventory were consistent with \u201csignificant problems with [Applicant\u2019s] thinking \nand concentration, as well as ruminative worry and distress.\u201d by Applicant. The \npsychologist diagnosed Applicant with high functioning ASD without accompanying \nintellectual impairment and with generalized anxiety. She opined that Applicant\u2019s ASD is a \ncondition that affects his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and explained: \nHis high functioning autism affects how he perceives information and \ncommunicates with others, and his coping mechanism is to ask questions \nuntil he feels sufficiently reassured that he understands and his uncertainty \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand anxiety about being perfect is alleviated. Given that [ASD] is a \npermanent condition and he does not have an intellectual impairment, his \nprognosis is fair. Although [Applicant] is capable of following directions and \nhe has an awareness of his symptoms, he will likely continue to have \nproblems with his psychosocial functioning, perceptions, and decision \nmaking. \nYet the psychologist also found Applicant\u2019s condition to be relatively stable at the time, and \nshe concluded he was not in immediate need of treatment. (Item 6.) \nApplicant strongly denies that his ASD should disqualify him from having a security \nclearance. He maintains that he has demonstrated his trustworthiness and reliability on the \njob by making \u201cmultiple careful judgment calls in a workplace environment where tools are \ndelicate and there are watchful eyes on all parts of the premises;\u201d and by calmly completing \nhis tasks. He denies having had any problems with keeping confidential matters about his \njob, and there is no evidence to the contrary. (Item 3.) Applicant presented no evidence \nfrom others about his judgment and reliability on the job. \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant indicated that claims made of his \u201codd \nbehaviors\u201d and physical outbursts in class in college were \u201cexaggerated and un-nuanced,\u201d \nand he was not ordered to counseling for such behaviors. He explained that his counseling \nwas voluntary for stresses in his life as a student and that at most he asked more questions \nthan his peers or talked more in group discussions. Applicant did not dispute the workplace \nincidents, which he explained happened during a particularly stressful time at home due to \nhis father\u2019s \u201cill-tempered behavior,\u201d including \u201copen fits of rage\u201d about being forced into \nearly retirement. His father\u2019s impatience and verbal anger directed at Applicant in the \nevenings \u201cwould become the baggage that [Applicant would] carry into the workplace the \nfollowing mornings.\u201d Applicant described the incidents as \u201cdeeply isolated\u201d and \u201cparticular \nto substantially stressful and unique situations at the workplace, when [he] was still in the \nmidst of then-newer routines a few years ago and made more vulnerable by [his] \nAsperger\u2019s \u2013 a condition that can put an inordinate amount of importance on routine and \norder.\u201d He became upset about the leaf blower because his \u201cperfectionist-self\u201d was \nstressed by finding things out of order, and he feared reprisal for not having a \u201cmajor tool \naccounted for at that time.\u201d He surmised that his head-banging on a metal dumpster at \nwork was \u201can overreaction to something that a newer then-on-site supervisor said, likely a \njoke that [he] took too seriously.\u201d (AE A.) \nWhen his father was hospitalized in December 2018, Applicant began to pursue \nsome solutions to deal with the stress at home. He began to drive himself to work after \nhaving relied on his father to drive him to work for the previous two years. In June 2019, his \nfamily had a counseling session, but Applicant primarily found support through a program at \nwork for people with disabilities where he had meetings with a job coach and other staff \u201cto \nprocess other issues and otherwise decompress.\u201d Throughout the summer 2019, he \nengaged in an exercise routine at a fitness center at his worksite to relieve some of his daily \nstresses as his father\u2019s health declined. He submits that these efforts \u201cbore frequent and \nfruitful results\u201d in his employment,\u201d and that he has learned to be more accepting of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunpredictable situations or react in calmer ways (AE A.)

He plans to seek counseling after \nthe current virus pandemic is resolved, but he was not specific as to the source or nature of \nthe counseling. (AE A.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concerns about psychological conditions are articulated in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative \ninference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on \nthe basis of mental health counseling. \nAs a youth, Applicant was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome (now diagnosed as \nASD under the DSM-5), a developmental disorder that is characterized by impaired social \ninteraction, repetitive patterns of behavior, restricted interests, atypical sensory responses, \nand some pragmatic deficits. He disputes the validity of college reports of his \u201codd \nbehaviors\u201d and \u201cphysical outbursts in class,\u201d and the evidence of that behavior is largely \nhearsay. However, Applicant did admit to a licensed psychologist in January 2019 that he \ndominated classes in college by asking questions excessively and that he lacked some \ncontrol over that behavior, and that he had counseling in college for social anxiety and \ndisinterest in socializing with others. In his present job, his ASD has reportedly manifested \nitself in head banging, angry outbursts, running throughout the workplace, and emotional \ndysregulation in front of customers. During his PSI, he disclosed that he had been \nreprimanded at work for chronic tardiness; that he intentionally banged his head on a \ndumpster when he was angry; and that he was suspended from work after he became \nupset, ran around, and cried about retrieving a leaf blower near his shift\u2019s end. During his \nJanuary 2019 psychological evaluation, he admitted that he has attempted to injure himself \nwith a sharp object in the past. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a) under Guideline I has \nsome applicability. It provides: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors. \nIn January 2019, a licensed psychologist diagnosed Applicant with highly-functioning \nASD without accompanying intellectual impairment and with generalized anxiety. In her \nopinion, his ASD is a permanent condition that affects his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness with respect to his psychosocial functioning, perceptions, and decision \nmaking. AG \u00b6 28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness,\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nis also established. While Applicant strongly disagrees with the psychologist\u2019s assessment, \nher clinical opinion is entitled to weight in light of her qualifications and the absence of a \ncontrary assessment by a duly-qualified medical or mental-health professional. \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, \nor acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s \nprevious condition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability \nof recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) do not apply because it was not shown that Applicant is \ncurrently undergoing treatment and following a plan managed by a qualified clinician. The \npsychologist who evaluated Applicant for the DOD found Applicant\u2019s ASD to be relatively \nstable as of the January 2019 evaluation and that he was not in immediate need of \ntreatment. She opined that Applicant is capable of following directions, which is a factor in \nApplicant\u2019s favor when determining whether he can be counted on to understand and \ncomply with the rules and regulations for the handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. However, the psychologist also opined that Applicant is likely to continue to \nhave problems with decision making. Even if Applicant\u2019s ASD can be considered to be \ncurrently in control within the context of AG \u00b6 29(c), the psychologist gave him only a fair \nprognosis as to the risk of recurrence or exacerbation. Regarding AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(d) and 29(e), \nthere is no recent evidence of incidents by Applicant reflective of emotional instability, but \nASD is a permanent condition. Even those persons with the least severe level of ASD are \nin need of support for their disorder according to the DSM-5. The inflexibility of their \nbehavior causes significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. \nApplicant\u2019s ASD has manifested itself at his workplace in behaviors (head banging, crying, \nangry outbursts) which reflect difficulty in adapting to unexpected situations and in \nresponding to stress. While ASD without intellectual impairment is not a condition that is per \nse disqualifying, Applicant did not sufficiently rebut the opinion of a duly-qualified mental \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth professional that his ASD affects his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s uncorroborated assertion of personal improvement since the psychological \nevaluation is not enough to overcome the psychological conditions security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security clearance eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline I \nare incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nI do not doubt that Applicant\u2019s job is important to him. However, the impact of an \nadverse decision is not a relevant consideration in determining national security eligibility. \nSee ISCR Case No. 19-01759 at 3 (App. Bd. June 8, 2020). Because Applicant chose to \nhave his security clearance eligibility evaluated without a hearing, I was unable to assess \nhis sincerity and demeanor. The Appeal Board recently held that credibility determinations \nwithout the benefit of in-person demeanor observations are indistinguishable from a judge\u2019s \nfact-finding about purely documentary evidence. See ISCR Case No. 19-02544 (App. Bd. \nAug. 31, 2020). Applicant presented no employment or character references attesting to his \ncurrent judgment and reliability in handling his personal and work affairs. The Appeal Board \nhas repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails \nto safeguard classified information before denying or revoking security clearance eligibility. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F. \n2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Berry, Esq. \n01/25/2021 \nDecision \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Although Applicant \nhas made some strides toward resolving the issues raised in the SOR, he has failed to \ndemonstrate a track record of debt repayment and financial reform. Clearance is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 12, 2019, the DOD issued an SOR detailing security concerns \nunder the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by \nPresident Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \na determination whether to revoke his security clearance. Applicant timely answered the \nSOR and requested hearing. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nAt the hearing, convened on September 23, 2020, I appended to the record as \nHearing Exhibits (HE) I and II, the Case Management Order I issued in this case on \nSeptember 1, 2020, and the Government\u2019s discovery letter, dated January 31, 2020.

He completed a security \nclearance application in March 2018, in anticipation of employment in a federal agency. \nApplicant disclosed derogatory financial information on the application, including: his \nfailure to file his federal income tax returns since 2014; two delinquent student loan \naccounts; four delinquent credit card accounts; and, and a delinquent mortgage. The \nbackground investigation confirmed Applicant\u2019s financial problems. The SOR alleges \nthat Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns from 2014 to 2018 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), that he lost a home to foreclosure in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that he owes over \n$101,000 on 14 delinquent accounts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.s). (GE 1, 5; Tr. 24-25, 56 100) \n \n \nApplicant has worked in the information technology field since 2011. Between \n2011 and 2018, Applicant lived in a low-cost-of-living state, earning between $130,000 \nand $160,000, depending on the bonuses he earned during the year. In the fall of 2014, \nApplicant decided to switch from an engineering role to a sales role, hoping to increase \nhis earning potential through sales commissions. In doing so, Applicant accepted a \n$30,000 reduction in his base pay. Despite the pay cut, Applicant was able to purchase \na home in late 2014. Although Applicant admits he was overextended at times, he \nbelieved he could comfortably afford his home and two luxury vehicles. (Tr. 28-29, 93-\n96) \n \nApplicant considered himself financially stable in 2015, but admitted that the \ndeaths of his father and stepfather at the end of 2014 left him out of sorts, and he failed \nto file his 2014 federal income tax returns. By the summer of 2015, Applicant returned to \nhis engineering positon and his higher salary. In late 2015, Applicant decided to move to \nanother city within the state and rented his home to an acquaintance from his church for \na one-year lease period. Applicant returned to his home city in November 2015 and \nrented an apartment for an 18-month lease term. Unbeknownst to Applicant, his renter \nabandoned the property in September. Applicant did not learn that the property was \nempty until November 2015. He could not afford to break his recently-signed lease. The \ncompany Applicant retained to manage the property could not find another renter \nbecause the property was in disrepair. Applicant retained a realtor to sell the home, but \nhe could not afford the repairs required to prepare the home for sale. As a result, \nApplicant began to pay both the mortgage on his home and the rent on the apartment. \nIn addition to his other bills, he also supported his girlfriend, who was unemployed.

In April 2018, \nApplicant resigned his position after accepting a position with a federal agency. \nHowever, the agency rescinded the offer after Applicant was unable to obtain an interim \nsecurity clearance. He remained unemployed until September 2018. During this period \nof unemployment, the creditor repossessed the vehicle alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, resulting \nin a $48,764 deficiency balance. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.i, 1.k, 1.r, and 1.s \ntotaling $18,993, also became delinquent. (GE 2 -Tr. 55-56,100) \n \n \nApplicant began his current position in October 2018, earning $165,000. Once he \nstarted working, Applicant began providing $1,000 in financial support to his mother \neach month. He also hired an accountant to help him resolve his outstanding federal \nincome tax returns. Between February and August 2020, Applicant filed his 2014 \nthrough 2019 income tax returns. After filing the outstanding returns, Applicant owed \nover $22,117 in federal taxes for the 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. The IRS \napplied overpayments from tax years 2015 ($1,736) and 2019 ($9,810) to the balance, \nsatisfying the amounts due for the 2014 and 2016 tax years. Applicant currently owes \nover $9,200 for the 2017 ($1,688) and 2018 ($7,609) tax years. At the time of the \nhearing, Applicant had not received an installment agreement from the IRS. In absence \nof an installment agreement, Applicant testified that he set up automated payment to the \nIRS on the 16th of each month. However, the documentation he provided only shows \nthree payments in April, June, and July 2020, totaling $700. (GE 5; AE C-H, N, P Tr.30-\n32, 5, 88, 101-102, 115-119) \n  \n \nTo date, Applicant has resolved 5 of the 14 debts alleged in the SOR: \u00b6\u00b6 1.j (1.q \nis a duplicate of this account and is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor), 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, and 1.r, \ntotaling $3,904. The bank was able to sell the foreclosed home alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for \nmore than the amount owed on the loan. The remaining outstanding debt totals $93,242 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.i, and 1.s). Applicant testified that he had been in contact with each of \nhis creditors and had negotiated settlements on each of the remaining accounts, \nreducing the total amount owed to $42,892, which he plans to resolve by March 2021. \nHowever, Applicant only provided corroborating evidence of two of the settlement offers. \nThe settlement offer for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, agreeing to accept $17,067 of \nthe $48,764 owed, expired in November 2019. The offer for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i, agreeing to accept $1,225 of the $2,443 balance due, expired in May 2020. \n(Answer; AE N, Q-R; Tr. 34-35, 39 \u2013 46, 50, 67-84) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npaid both obligations through May 2017, when he stopped paying the mortgage. \nHowever, he continued to pay the homeowners\u2019 association fees and other expenses \nrequired to maintain the home, which amounted to approximately $300 per month. \nBetween 2016 and 2017, the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j., 1.l, and \n1.n, totaling approximately $29,820 became delinquent. (Answer; GE 2, 4-5; Tr. 28-29, \n32-34, 96-99, 102-113) \nApplicant believes that he currently lives within his means. He earns $205,000 \nper year, which includes commissions.

He hopes to resume his teaching position supervising post-\ngraduate students in 2021. He plans to apply the $25,000 in income toward his \ndelinquent debt. (GE 5; AE N; Tr. 36, 38-39, 48-50, 55, 59-63, 84-88, 114-122) \nApplicant participates in service projects through his fraternity, as well as a \nuniversity and a non-profit organization dedicated to providing services in his \nhometown. Applicant\u2019s character witnesses, two of whom are long-time clearance \nholders, describe Applicant as a good person, who is a conscientious rule follower. \nEach witness was aware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and none have observed \nApplicant living extravagantly or above his means. All recommend him for access to \nclassified information. (AE K, S-U; Tr. 16-23, 123-131) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima \nfacie case. The following financial considerations disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently file annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe record contains some mitigating evidence. Applicant did not incur delinquent \ndebt under circumstances that indicate reckless or irresponsible spending. He incurred \ndelinquent debt during two periods of financial difficulty caused by events beyond his \ncontrol. In the fall of 2015, Applicant faced a difficult financial situation after the person \nrenting his home damaged, then abandoned the property. The choices Applicant faced \n\u2013 defaulting on his apartment lease or defaulting on his home mortgage, came with \nserious financial consequences. In an effort to honor his financial obligations, Applicant \npaid both obligations for over a year. However, doing so was unsustainable and caused \nhim to incur significant delinquent debt. He incurred additional delinquent debt during a \nsix-month period of unemployment in 2018.  \nSince returning to work, Applicant has paid over $3,900 toward his delinquent \naccounts. He has also filed his outstanding federal income tax returns and paid $700 \ntoward his outstanding federal tax liability as he awaits an installment agreement from \nthe IRS. He timely filed his 2019 federal income tax return. The following financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions partially apply: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.\u2019 loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death , divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG\u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s actions, while evidence of his willingness to pay his debts, \nhis actions have not established the track record of debt repayment or financial \nrehabilitation necessary to fully mitigate the alleged financial considers. His intention to \nresolve his remaining outstanding debt and tax liability by March 2021, is a well-\nmeaning promise to pay his delinquent debts, which does not mitigate the security \nconcern. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). When considered together Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts and the favorable character evidence in the record is not enough to \novercome the security concerns raised by his recent history of financial problems and \nthe lack of evidence establishing a record of financial rehabilitation and reform. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.j \u2013 1.l, 1.n, 1.q,  \nand 1.r: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.i, 1.m, 1.r \u2013 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o and 1.p: \nOmitted \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He has worked for defense \ncontractors almost continuously since 1991, and he has worked as an electronic \ntechnician for his current employer since June 2017. He first applied for a security \nclearance in 1991 and has continuously held classified access since 1991. (GE 1; GE 5; \nTr. 11-14, 25-27, 57) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 16 delinquent debts, totaling $36,523. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations, except SOR \u00b6 1.h. Each of the \ndebts alleged in the SOR were confirmed by Applicant\u2019s three credit bureau reports (CBR) \ndated April 2018, April 2019, and March 2021, respectively. (Answer; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; \nGE 5 at 3-5) \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies primarily to a three-month period of \nunemployment following his June 2014 termination. At the time, he was earning \napproximately $70,000 a year. He was then was underemployed for the next three years, \nand he earned significantly less than he did prior to his June 2014 termination. \nAdditionally, Applicant testified that his 2004 and 2011 divorces, child support obligations, \nand the additional financial support he provided to ill family members also contributed to \nhis financial issues. (GE 1; GE 5; Tr. 21-22, 25, 28-33, 50) \nPrior to his 2014 termination, Applicant had missed a few child support payments, \nbut none of his debts had been placed for collection. The debts alleged in the SOR \nbecame delinquent between July 2014 and 2018. They consist primarily of consumer \ndebts, loans, and credit cards. Applicant also has five outstanding medical bills totaling \n$441. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 29-30, 33-38, 41-45, 51) \nAfter he was fired in 2014, Applicant consulted with an attorney regarding his \nfinancial difficulties. The attorney advised Applicant to focus on his current bills rather \nthan address his debts that had been placed for collection or charged off by creditors. \nShortly after he started working for his current employer, in 2017, Applicant met with a \nfinancial counselor who explained credit to him and credit scores, and they developed a \nplan to pay his bills and manage a written budget. As of the hearing, he used Credit Karma \nand monitored his credit with the credit bureau agencies. (Tr. 21-22, 38-39, 52-54, 60) \nIn 2020, Applicant contacted \u201ca couple of\u201d the creditors of his smaller debts. He \nlearned that the outstanding balances were larger than he realized; therefore, he \ncontacted another attorney. This attorney recommended that Applicant \u201cstop the \nbleeding\u201d and work within a budget. Shortly thereafter, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s hours were reduced from 40 to 20 or 25 hours a week, reducing her \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincome to $30,000 annually. Because of her reduced income, they were unable to afford \nto address any of their outstanding debts. (Tr. 21-23, 25-26, 40-42)  \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b61.h. At one time, he had multiple loans with this payday \nloan company, and he testified that he had resolved all outstanding loans. In his opinion, \nthis debt was erroneously reported. As of the hearing, he had not contested it with the \ncreditor or the credit bureau agencies. (Tr. 43-44, 51-52) \nApplicant has made no payments toward any of the alleged debts, but he has no \nnew delinquent debts or obligations. He owes approximately $2,000 to the federal \ngovernment for unpaid taxes owed from a 401k loan that he took out in 2017. He is not in \na payment installment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), but makes \nsporadic payments. His last payment was in 2020. This debt was not alleged in the SOR; \ntherefore, it is not disqualifying, but it will be considered within the Guideline F mitigation \nanalysis and whole-person analysis. (Tr. 24, 32-33, 47, 54-55) \nApplicant intends to resolve his delinquent debts. At the hearing, he admitted that \npaying his delinquent debts was not a priority in the past, but he recognized the \nimportance of resolving his debts. Applicant and his wife are trying to generate more \nincome to resolve their outstanding debts. She is looking for another job that has a higher \nsalary, and he started a real estate business in 2020, but it had not earned any income \nas of the hearing date. (Tr. 49, 56-60) \nSince June 2017, Applicant has earned approximately $69,000 annually. His wife \nis an office manager for a dental practice and currently earns $30,000 annually. He has \napproximately $25,000 in his 401k and $50,000 invested in cryptocurrency. Applicant has \na net monthly remainder of $800. (Tr. 26, 32, 40, 46, 50-51, 55) \nApplicant provided copies of his 2019 and 2020 work performance evaluations. He \nis considered a strong performer and a valued employee.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues started after he was fired from his employer in 2014. \nHe struggled to regain employment with a commensurate salary until 2017. His finances \nwere also negatively affected by his divorces, child support obligations, and other family-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nrelated financial support. In March 2020, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s salary was greatly reduced \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicant sought financial counseling, and as a result \nfollows a budget and lives within his means. However, he has not initiated any actions to \nresolve his existing delinquent debts. Many of the conditions that contributed to \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were beyond his control, but he has not demonstrated that \nhe acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts. \nApplicant has worked for his current employer for almost four years, but he has \nfailed to address any of the debts alleged in the SOR, small or large. Although he has no \nnew delinquent consumer debts, Applicant\u2019s financial issues continue to be an ongoing \nconcern. He has a $2,000 federal income tax debt from 2017. As of the date of the \nhearing, he had not established payment arrangements with the IRS. Finally, although \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.h, he failed to provide proof to substantiate his claim that it is \nnot a valid debt. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) was \nnot established. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He \ndid not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns or establish his eligibility \nfor a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.p:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \nSubparagraph: 2.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On December 19, 2019, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \neffective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on February 13, 2020, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on March 25, 2020. The case was assigned to me on May 12, 2020. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a final Notice of Hearing on \nSeptember 28, 2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 21, 2020. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits A and B at the hearing, which were \nadmitted without objection, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript \nof this hearing on October 30, 2020. The record then closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 55 years old and married with three children. He has an associate of \narts degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as a systems \nadministrator since July 2017. Applicant is seeking to obtain national security eligibility \nand a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at \nSections 12, 13A, and 17.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had a single charged-off debt in the amount of \n$85,026. Applicant denied this allegation in his Answer, stating that his, \u201ccurrent credit \nreports show[ed] no outstanding collections.\u201d \nApplicant bought a house in approximately 2004 and obtained a first and second \nmortgage. The total amount of his indebtedness was approximately $160,000. Applicant \nwas able to maintain his regular monthly payments on this house until approximately \nOctober 2011. During that year the housing market where he lived collapsed, and his \nhouse was worth approximately half of what he owed on it. Applicant made repeated \nattempts with his creditors to readjust the mortgages, all to no avail. So Applicant and his \nwife were faced with a situation where they were making payments on a house that was \nnot worth what was owed. Applicant was also laid off from a prior job in 2010 and used \nup his savings to make his mortgage payments until he found a new job several months \nlater. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 17, Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 15-23, 27, 30.) \nAt about the same time Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was laid off from her job and in \ndanger of having her own house foreclosed upon. Applicant and his wife could not \ncontinue payments on their house and make payments on the mother-in-law\u2019s house as \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nwell. The decision was made by Applicant and his wife to move into the mother-in-law\u2019s \nhouse, and make payments in anticipation that the house would eventually become theirs. \nThey have lived in this house since this time and have made timely payments on the \nmother-in-law\u2019s mortgage. (Tr. 21, 30-32.) \nApplicant stopped making payments on his house in late 2011 due to his inability \nto work out a resolution with the mortgage companies. He returned the keys to the house \nto the first mortgage holder in approximately August 2012. (Tr. 24-25.) \nApplicant stated that he received no communications from the mortgage \ncompanies after he returned the keys, even though they had his new address. He did not \nreceive an IRS Form 1099 regarding forgiveness of debt. (Tr. 25-27, 29.) \nSeven credit reports were submitted, three by the Government (Government \nExhibits 3 through 5) and four by Applicant (two with his Answer; Applicant Exhibits A and \nB). The oldest, Government Exhibit 3 from 2017, shows the subject debt. The other five \nreports do not show that debt. All of the credit reports show that Applicant had no other \ndelinquent debt. Applicant stated that his current financial situation is stable. He is able \nto maintain payments on all of his current debts. (Tr. 32-33.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed approximately $85,000 for a past-due mortgage that was charged \noff when the house was foreclosed upon in 2012. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues concerning his house were caused by a massive \ndownturn in the economy in his home state. Unemployment for several months had \ndepleted his savings and left him in a difficult position. At the same time his mother-in-law \nhad financial issues that affected her own house. Applicant made the difficult, but to him \nresponsible, decision to allow his house to be foreclosed on while helping his mother-in-\nlaw by paying her mortgage and living in her house with his wife. The record evidence \ndoes not show any other delinquent debt, supporting the finding that this was a one-time \noccurrence, which occurred nine years ago. His current financial status is stable, and he \nevinces a credible intent and ability to maintain that stability into the future. Applicant has \nthe knowledge and ability that will allow him to stay on a proper financial footing. He has \nfully mitigated the allegations in the SOR. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation. The situation regarding his mortgage was \nsingular, never repeated, and does not evince poor judgment or unreliability. He has \nminimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood of \nrecurrence. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to \nApplicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility, and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

SOR 1.a \u2013 The allegation reads that Applicant occasionally consumed alcohol excessively to an intoxicated level since November 1956. He denied the allegation because he was born in November 1956. See Item 2 at 7.

He provided personal subject interviews (PSls) to an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on June 6, 2014 (Item 4), \nand January 30, 2019 (item 3). After being unable to make an affirmative finding regarding \nApplicant's security clearance eligibility, on April 10, 2020, the Department of Defense \n(DOD), Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA), issued an SOR detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. This case is adjudicated in \naccordance with Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \n1 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) dated June 8, 2017. \nThe Government sent a copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), the Government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of the SOR, to Applicant \non December 18, 2020. The FORM included six items of evidence listed within Section II \nof the FORM. He received the FORM on January 7, 2021. The FORM recommended he \nfile objections, submit additional information or provide explanations within 30 days of \nreceiving the FORM. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, filed on February 3, 2021, is \nadmitted into evidence. I was assigned the case on February 25, 2021. \nRulings on Evidence \nIn a footnote on the second page of the FORM, the Government advised \nApplicant that he could make corrections to the June 6, 2014, personal subject interview \n(Item 5, PSI) to improve the exhibit\u2019s clarity and accuracy. Alternatively, he was advised \nthat if he objected to the entire PSI on the ground that it was unauthenticated by a \ngovernment witness, it would not be entered into evidence. Applicant did not object, and \nthe exhibit is admitted into evidence. He had already affirmatively indicated in his \nresponse to interrogatories that he agreed that the January 30, 2019 PSI accurately \nreflected the information he provided to the OPM investigator. He signed the interrogatory \nresponses Item 3) by indicating the day \u20187\u2019 and year \u20182020\u2019; however, he did not identify a \nmonth. The notary notarized the responses twice, but apparently did not notice that the \nmonth was missing on each subscription line. Based on his responses to the January \n2019 PSI, I am satisfied that he fully read and comprehended the exhibit. See Item 3 at \n9, 11, 13. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges various components of Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol \nconsumption, including the nature and frequency of use, an alcohol-related incident in \nNovember 2016, a subsequent medical evaluation in June 2017, and a six-page medical \nassessment from January 2019, including a diagnosis and treatment recommendation by \na medical health professional. \nApplicant is 64 years old and married to his long-time girlfriend since 2019 (Item \n2 at 7; Item 3 at 9) He has owned his residence since 2001. After three years of technical \nschool, he earned an aircraft and power plant license in July 1992, and an associate\u2019s \ndegree in applied environmental science and technology in June 2005. Since October \n2005, he has worked for his current employer as a preflight tester of refueling cargo \ntankers. (Item 2 at 9-12) In April 2014, he was investigated by OPM and received an \ninterim security clearance. Applicant seeks a security clearance.

SOR 1.a \n\u2013 The allegation reads that Applicant occasionally consumed alcohol excessively to an \nintoxicated level since November 1956. He denied the allegation because he was born in \nNovember 1956. See Item 2 at 7. This allegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor as there is \nno evidence indicating Applicant consumed alcohol since his birth. In addition, the period \nwhen Applicant began using alcohol will be appropriately addressed under SOR 1.b.  \nSOR 1.b \u2013 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied he consumed alcohol \nweekly to the point of intoxication. Rather, he claimed that he occasionally drinks to \nintoxication, but not to the point of \u201cfalling down drunk.\u201d Applicant stated that the \nphraseology of SOR 1.b would suggest that he was an \u201cirresponsible drunk.\u201d (Answer to \nSOR) \nApplicant\u2019s January 2019 PSI provides insight into his historical consumption \nhabits. When he began drinking in his 20s (1976 to 1986), he consumed a case of beer \nover a weekend at his home or at parties. Subsequently, he switched his drinking \npreference to a pint of whiskey on the weekends. (Item 3 at 6) \nApplicant\u2019s consumption frequency did not change during the period of his \nunalleged 1980 or 1981 alcohol-related offense. (Item 2 at 28-29) Subsequently, his \ndrinking increased to a case of beer and a pint of whiskey over the weekend. Sometimes \nhe drank less and sometimes more. \nSOR 1.f \u2013 On November 2016, Applicant was arrested for driving while under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI) after consuming about one-half of a fifth of whiskey on his 60th \nbirthday. He became hungry and drove to a food store. While driving home from the store, \nhe struck the left quarter panel of an oncoming vehicle after misjudging the median line \nin the road. His blood alcohol content was two or three times the legal limit. Applicant \nadmitted to the arresting officers that he was drunk though he did not feel intoxicated on \nthe way to the store. Applicant reported the arrest to his employer\u2019s security official within \na month after the arrest. Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI and negligent driving. He was \nsentenced to one day in jail, a fine, and an alcohol-awareness class and a fine. In June \n2017, a chemical dependency professional (CDP) conducted an assessment and found \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant had a substance use disorder. Applicant \ncompleted the awareness class. (Item 3 at 5, 15-16) \nAn ignition lock system was also installed and required to remain attached to his \ncar ignition for a year. Applicant was scheduled to have the ignition lock removed in \nSeptember 2018, but the system was not removed at that time because of the sensitivity \nof the system. He claimed that the system registered violations even though he had not \nbeen drinking. The system was not designed to activate until the BAC was .04 or more. \n(Item 3 at 5) He indicated he had the system removed following the January 2019 PSI, \nthough he did not indicate when. (Item 3 at 9) Applicant completed the alcohol awareness \nclass in 2017. (Item 3 at 5) \n3 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing his driving while under the influence (DWI) arrest and conviction in \nNovember 2016, he reduced his drinking to two pints of whiskey occasionally over a \nweekend from November 2016 to January 2019. Applicant declared that he stopped \ndrinking a few weeks before his January 2019 PSI because of the continuing ignition lock \nviolations propelling his intention to remove the system from his car. (Item 3 at 6-7) \nApplicant viewed his drinking as a habit or addiction. He enjoyed the influence of \nalcohol and would drink until he eventually passed out. He defined the excessive use of \nalcohol as drinking every night; he considered the habitual use of alcohol as drinking every \nnight and downing a pint of whiskey. Applicant denied drinking nightly, but drank to \nintoxication when he drank. His drinking has never caused personal or professional \nproblems, but he was concerned about the impact of drinking on his health. Applicant \nmade attempts in the past to stop drinking for varying periods of time, but always resumed. \n(Item 3 at 7) \nAfter he stopped drinking a few weeks before the January 2019 PSI, Applicant \nreported that he was drinking between one-half to a pint of whiskey on a weekend basis \nduring November and December 2019. He noted that he only drank on the weekend, \nabstaining occasionally for a week or a month. (Item 3 at 12-13) \nIn \nApplicant\u2019s \nFebruary 2021 response to the FORM, Applicant indicated he was consuming alcohol on \nan infrequent basis on the weekends. \nSOR 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e will be addressed together as they involve Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2019 assessment, his decision not to participate in recommended treatment, and \ncontinuing to consume alcohol. \nSOR 1.c \u2013 there is no record evidence indicating that Applicant received \ntreatment at the recovery center in January 2019. There is a six-page January 15, 2019 \nassessment of Applicant by a CDP. She took notes of the history of Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nuse. He described his alcohol use in the previous 12 months as occurring on the weekend, \nbut not every weekend. He described himself as a weekend binge user with recurring \nefforts to reduce his drinking. Applicant was quoted as indicating he was drinking too \nmuch. The CDP noted that he continued to use alcohol despite the physical and \npsychological problems aggravated by use. Though his alcohol use never affected he \nwork, he acknowledged missing a few Mondays because of drinking. (Item 6 at 1-6) \nThe CDP diagnosed Applicant with alcohol abuse \u2013 severe. The primary reasons \nfor the diagnosis were: (1) alcohol consumed in larger amounts than intended; (2) \nunsuccessful efforts to reduce drinking; (3) interference with social functioning; and, (4) \nconsuming increased amounts of alcohol to reach intoxication. The CDP recommended \nintensive outpatient treatment including two weekly support meetings. Applicant \nreportedly wanted to start the treatment in a couple of weeks after the assessment. (Item \n6 at 4-6) \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claims he voluntarily went to the center for an assessment and to \ninvestigate outpatient therapy \u201cto completely quit drinking any alcoholic beverages.\u201d His \ndecision to visit the center was based on discussions with other coworkers who noticed \nimproved health after they stopped drinking. (Answer to SOR) \nSOR 1.d \u2013 Applicant denied this allegation because it was only recommended \nthat he seek treatment, and the CDP administrator did not tell him that he had a severe \nalcohol abuse disorder. In addition, his earlier court-ordered assessment cleared him of \nany medical condition. That court-ordered assessment was in June 2017, two years \nearlier. See Item 3 at 15-16. He recalled that the January 2019 CDP administrator \ncontacted him on several occasions to find out when he planned to begin the treatment. \nHe decided not to attend the treatment because the meetings, which met three days a \nweek from six to nine p.m., interfered with his work schedule. The second reason was \nbecause of the long distance to the outpatient meetings. Applicant does not believe he \nhas a severe problem with alcohol. A review of the documentation reflects that intensive \noutpatient treatment (IOP) was recommended. Two weekly sober support meetings were \nalso recommended. (Answer to SOR; Item 3 at 6; Item 6 at 6) \nSOR 1.e \u2013 Applicant denied this allegation because he was never ordered to \nattend rehabilitation. He has a drink on the weekends and has not been intoxicated in a \nlong time. (Answer to SOR) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that he \nadmits or denies. The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a \nfavorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption  \nThe security concerns of the guideline for alcohol consumption are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 21: \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes the condition that may be disqualifying: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nApplicant engaged in binge drinking on the weekends since his 20s (1976 and \n1986). His drinking remained unchanged up to the unalleged alcohol-related incident in \n1980 or 1981. Subsequently, his drinking increased to whiskey and beer on the \nweekends. Though he made attempts to stop or abstain for differing periods, he always \nresumed. He viewed his alcohol consumption as a habit or addiction. He did not drink \nevery day, but when he drank, he drank to intoxication. After the November 2016 DUI, he \nclaims he reduced his drinking until he stopped a few weeks before his PSI in January \n2019. Coincidentally in the same month, the CDP diagnosed him as having a severe \nalcohol use disorder, and recommended he begin intensive outpatient treatment program. \nHowever, he declined and resumed drinking by November 2019. As recently as February \n3, 2021, he was still drinking on occasion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 21(a), (c), (d), and (e) apply. \nAG \u00b6 23 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it  \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \n6 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant has a long history serious alcohol use. Though he committed a \nDUI in November 2016, he continued to consume alcohol at problematic levels. He \ncontinues to drink to excess even though he was diagnosed as having a severe \nalcohol use disorder in January 2019. He failed to follow the treatment advice \nrecommendation of the CDP. Applicant\u2019s continued pattern of alcohol consumption \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not \napply. \nThe six-page January 2019 assessment shows that the CDP collected \nextensive historical information about the scope and frequency of Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol use. At the conclusion of her report, she supplied persuasive reasons for \nher diagnosis and recommendation for treatment. According to her report, \nApplicant was willing to participate in treatment. \nApplicant did not attend treatment because it was only a recommendation \nand the CDP did not tell him he had a severe alcohol use disorder. In light of the \nCDP\u2019s repeated efforts to enroll Applicant in treatment, he should have realized \nthat her entreaties were based on the excessive scope of Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nconsumption. His claim that the CDP did not tell him about the diagnosis is not \ncredible or relevant to the accuracy and probative value of the diagnosis. \nFurthermore, the documented medical diagnosis speaks for itself. Because of the \npassage of almost 18 months, the chemical assessment summary in June 2017 \nhas little relevance to January 2019 assessment. After contrasting the two \nassessments, it is clear the January 2019 CDP had much more information at her \nfingertips upon which to support her diagnosis. \nBecause Applicant does not admit his problem is severe, and has not \nfurnished clear evidence of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations, AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b), 23(c), and 23(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for alcohol consumption in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n    \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n___________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the late 1970s, Applicant began weekend binge drinking of beer. In the 1980s, \nhe increased his weekend drinking to beer and whiskey. He drank at a fairly consistent \nlevel until his DUI in November 2016. Though he claimed he made an attempt to drink \nless between November 2016 and his PSI in January 2019, there is very little evidence to \nsupport his claim. Despite his severe alcohol use disorder diagnosis pronounced by the \nCDP in January 2019, and his failure to comply with CDP\u2019s treatment recommendation, \nhe does not believe he has a severe problem and he continues to consume alcohol. His \noverall denial and minimization of the overall seriousness of his alcohol disorder has not \nbeen mitigated. Having weighed the evidence from a commonsense point of view, \nApplicant has not overcome the security concerns arising from the guideline for alcohol \nconsumption. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

The case was assigned \nto me on May 9, 2021. On June 9, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for June 14, 2021. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled. Applicant waived the 15-day notice required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.8. (Tr. 44-45.) Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other \nwitnesses or submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 24, 2021. \nI kept the record open until June 30, 2021, to enable Applicant to submit \ndocumentary evidence. At her request, I extended the deadline until July 12, 2021. She \ntimely submitted Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through J, but AX D through J were illegible. I \nextended the deadline until August 10, 2021, to enable her to submit legible copies of AX \nD through J. On August 10, she sent me an email explaining a medical debt, but she did \nnot send legible copies of her exhibits. On August 11, I reminded her that her exhibits \nwere illegible, and I extended the deadline for submitting legible copies to August 13. She \ndid not respond to my August 11 email. The email correspondence regarding the illegible \nexhibits is included in the record as a Hearing Exhibit. AX A through C were admitted \nwithout objection. I did not admit the illegible copies of AX D through J. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, \n1.f, and 1.k-1.s. She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g-1.j. Her \nadmissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old pipefitter employed by a defense contractor since April \n2018. She married in January 2015 and divorced in June 2018. She has a 14-year-old \nson from a previous relationship who lives with her. She received an associate\u2019s degree \nin April 2015. She has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts that are reflected in credit reports from June \n2021 (GX 2) and February 2019 (GX 3). The evidence regarding these debts is \nsummarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c: debts to the U.S. Government for educational benefits, \nplaced for collection of $13,303; $1,562; and $15,248. These debts were incurred \nbetween August 2015 and October 2016, when Applicant used her husband\u2019s military \neducational benefits to attend college. They became delinquent when her husband did \nnot complete the military service required to qualify for the benefits, and the Department \nof Veterans Affairs (VA) initiated action to recoup the benefits. The record does not reflect \nwhether her husband\u2019s premature termination of military service was voluntary or \ninvoluntary. A notification of the overpayment was sent in December 2016 to an address \nwhere Applicant no longer resided. She learned about the overpayment when her tax \nrefund for tax year 2018 was diverted to repay the overpayment. She appealed the \ndecision in December 2019, but her appeal was denied.

The case was closed and is reflected in VA records as \u201cunresolved\u201d as of \nJune 21, 2021 (AX A.) Her pay was garnished for $200 per week from January 2019 until \nFebruary or March 2019, when the garnishment was stopped because of the COVID \npandemic. She testified that she has continued to dispute the debts, but she has been \ntold by the VA that she must set up a payment plan in September 2021. (Tr. 19-22.) The \nrecord does not reflect whether any attempt was made to collect the debts from \nApplicant\u2019s husband. She testified that she has been in contact with him, but she is not \nconfident that he will help her resolve them. (Tr. 26.) The debts have not been resolved, \nbut they are not yet delinquent because the deadline for establishing a payment plan has \nnot passed. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: cellphone bill placed for collection of $446. This debt was referred \nfor collection in September 2017. Applicant paid it in in August 2019. (AX C.) It is not \nreflected in the June 2021 credit report. (GX 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: cellphone bill placed for collection of $121. This debt was referred \nfor collection in February 2016. Applicant testified that she paid this debt. (Tr. 23.) She \ndid not submit any legible documentation to corroborate her testimony. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: delinquent medical bill for $169. Applicant admitted this debt and it \nis reflected in the June 2021 credit report (GX 2 at 1.) She testified that she would pay it \npromptly. (Tr. 24.) In her August 10, 2021 email, she stated that the debt was paid, but \nshe did not submit legible documentation to corroborate her testimony. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.j: delinquent medical bills for $368, $450, $480, and $196. \nApplicant denied these debts on the ground that they had been paid. At the hearing, she \ntestified that she believed the debts were paid because they were no longer reflected on \nher credit report. (Tr. 24.) She did not submit any legible documentation showing that the \ndebts were resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: delinquent tuition bill placed for collection of $3,390. This debt was \nincurred when Applicant attended college courses, using her husband\u2019s educational \nbenefits. When her husband did not complete the military service required to qualify for \nthe benefits, the VA refused to pay Applicant\u2019s tuition, and the educational institution \nreferred the amount of tuition for collection. Applicant contested the VA decision for the \nsame reasons as the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l-1.s: delinquent student loans totaling $31,756. These debts were \nincurred before Applicant was married and before the educational debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c were incurred. She testified that the payments were due in about October 2015, \nand her pay was garnished to pay them. She testified that she set up a payment plan in \n2018 and made monthly payments until March 2020, when student loan payments were \ndeferred because of COVID-19. (Tr. 26-27.) She did not provide any documentation to \ncorroborate her testimony about a payment plan or payments made under the plan. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant earns about $60,000 per year. (Tr. 14.) She testified that she does not \nreceive child support from the father of her son because the father is disabled (Tr. 36.) \nShe has been enrolled in a credit-counseling program provided by her employer for a \u201cfew \nyears,\u201d and has been able to pay off some delinquent debts. She has also opened some \nnew accounts. The June 2021 credit report reflects a secured 12-month loan of $1,000 \nopened in January 2021, with monthly $84 payments which are current; a $15,000 \nunsecured loan opened in December 2020, with monthly $363 payments which are \ncurrent; and a $13,000 car loan, opened in March 2020, with monthly $240 payments \nwhich are current. (GX 2 at 2-33; Tr. 30-32.) \nThese new financial obligations have mixed significance. On one hand, they show \nthat Applicant has improved her credit rating to the extent that she was able to obtain the \nloans, and they show a limited pattern of financial responsibility. On the other hand, they \nraise questions about her ability to resolve the debts alleged in the SOR, because she \nhas incurred substantial new debts before the debts alleged in the SOR have been \nresolved. \nFor about two years, Applicant has been helping her mother financially. She initially \nwas giving her mother about $50 per month, but she has increased that amount to about \n$300 per month after her mother lost her job. (Tr. 33.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nraise two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nrecent. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.j and 1.l-1.s were not incurred under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.k \nwere incurred under unusual circumstances when her husband failed to complete his \nmilitary service obligation and lost the educational benefits that Applicant relied on to \nattend college. \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the educational debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and \n1.k. The failure of Applicant\u2019s husband to complete his service obligation was a condition \nbeyond her control. The failure of the VA to send Applicant notification of the termination \nof benefits at her correct address was a condition beyond her control. She has acted \nresponsibly by contesting the debts and contacting her ex-husband.

It is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.j, because Applicant did not provide \nlegible documentary evidence of payment. When applicants claim that debts have been \npaid, it is reasonable to expect them applicant to present documentary evidence showing \nresolution of the debts. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nIllegible documents do not constitute meaningful documentary evidence. The fact that the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.j are no longer reflected in the credit reports does not \nestablish that they were resolved. Debts are deleted from credit reports for various \nreasons, including the passage of time. See ISCR Case No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. \n13, 2019). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.l-1.s. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n(CARES Act) became law, and it provided for relief measures on Department of Education \n(DOE)-owned federal student loans through September 30, 2020. The CARES act \nprovided for automatic forbearance and zero interest charges during the forbearance. \nThis student-loan debt relief received several extensions. The most recent extension was \non January 20, 2021, and the COVID-19 emergency relief measures were extended on \nDOE-owned federal student loans through September 30, 2021. Appellant\u2019s student loans \nwent into forbearance on March 27, 2020, and are no longer delinquent. Notwithstanding \nthe forbearance, Appellant\u2019s student loans were delinquent before the forbearance went \ninto effect, and she presented no evidence to support her assertion that she established \na payment plan in 2018 and made payments until March 2020. Accordingly, there is an \nunmitigated concern that Appellant will not resume making voluntary payments on her \nstudent loans when the forbearance ends. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.k. Applicant \nwas not notified in December 2016 when her husband\u2019s educational benefits were \nterminated, because the notification was sent to the wrong address. Applicant\u2019s appeal in \nOctober 2018 was considered in December 2019 and resolved against her. (AX a At 3.) \nHer pay was garnished until March 2019, when the garnishment was stopped due to the \nCOVID pandemic. She has been informed by the VA that she must set up a payment plan \nby September 2021. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c are not resolved, but they are \nnot delinquent at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n04/05/2021 \nDecision \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is sufficient to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate his history of financial problems that were incurred when he suffered a heart \nattack, which was further complicated when his medical insurance company declined to \npay his claim. He\u2019s doing what he can to address a large amount of medical debt. \nAccordingly, this case is decided for Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non June 16, 2019. (Exhibit 3) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on March 23, 2020, after reviewing the application \nand the information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2020. He admitted the four SOR \nallegations and provided explanatory remarks. Altogether, his answer consists of 28 \npages, which includes 24 pages of supporting documents that will be considered as \nevidence. He requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn June 30, 2020, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM), which consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant, who received it on July 15, 2020. He did not reply within 30 days of \nreceipt of the FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 29, 2020. \nUpon review of the case, I exercised my discretion to reopen the evidentiary \nrecord to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation concerning his repayment \nefforts. I outlined the matter in an October 6, 2020 e-mail, which was addressed to both \nApplicant and Department Counsel. My e-mail is made part of the record as Appellate \nExhibit I. The record was left open until November 6, 2020. \nApplicant timely replied by e-mail on November 2, 2020, and his response \nincluded 11 attachments. In his e-mail, Applicant provided a short explanation \nconcerning the four SOR allegations. Department Counsel replied by e-mail on \nNovember 3, 2020, lodging no objections to consideration of Applicant\u2019s 11 \nattachments. In addition, Department Counsel provided an attachment-by-attachment \nanalysis. Applicant\u2019s e-mail and 11 attachments are admitted as Exhibit A. Department \nCounsel\u2019s response thereto is made part of the record as Appellate Exhibit II. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee who requires eligibility for access to \nclassified information for his job with a federal contractor. He works as a system \nadministrator for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since \nJanuary 2008. He has not held a security clearance in the past according to his security \nclearance application. (Exhibit 3 at Section 25) His first marriage ended in divorce. He \nmarried for the second time in 1996. He has three children, two adult daughters and a \nminor son. His education history shows he received a high school diploma in 1984. He \nhas lived at the same residential address since 2004. \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits a history of financial problems consisting \nof four delinquent accounts in amounts of $842, $65,291, $186, and $826 for a total of \nabout $67,145. In addition to his admissions, the delinquent accounts are established \nby admissible evidence. (Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6) \nApplicant disclosed the largest of the debts when he completed his security \nclearance application. (Exhibit 3 at Section 26) In February 2015 he suffered a heart \nattack during work hours and was rushed to a nearby Army medical center for \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntreatment. Although he had medical insurance (Answer at 4), he was registered as a \ncivilian patient without insurance. \nApplicant was unaware of the mistake until about March 27, 2015, when the \nDepartment of the Treasury notified him of the medical indebtedness. (Answer at 10) \nThe collection letter indicated that he owed $39,473, and that collection action would \ncontinue unless he made payment within ten days in the amount of $50,525, which \nincluded all applicable fees, interest, and penalties. \nApplicant challenged the amount of the indebtedness through a hearing process \nwith the Treasury Department. He filed a hearing request on April 13, 2015, in response \nto a second letter indicating an intention to initiate an administrative wage garnishment. \n(Answer at 3, 5) \nApplicant also contacted his health insurer seeking their assistance. They \nrequested he provide an itemized bill from the Army medical center. He submitted a \nclaim to his insurer on June 15, 2015, which included the documentation he was able to \nobtain from the Army medical center. (Answer at 11-27) He reports that his insurer \ndeemed his submission was insufficient and denied the claim. \nIn the meantime, Applicant\u2019s April 2015 request for a hearing with the relevant \noffice of the Treasury Department stopped or at least delayed the wage garnishment \naction. Applicant stated he \u201cwas foolish in believing the problem had gone away.\u201d \n(Answer at 3) The problem had not gone away but it did lie dormant until November \n2019 when the Treasury Department issued a wage garnishment order with a balance \ndue of $63,891. (Answer at 6-10) A July 2019 credit report indicates a balance due of \n$65,291. (Exhibit 5) A June 2020 credit report indicates a balance due of $62,403. \n(Exhibit 6) The current status of this account and the other three delinquent accounts is \naddressed below. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a concerns an $842 collection account owed to the \nDepartment of the Treasury. In his answer to the SOR and his November 2020 e-mail, \nApplicant explained that he paid the debt in April 2020 but lost the receipt. The debt is \nreported as delinquent in the July 2019 credit report but not the more recent June 2020 \ncredit report. (Exhibits 5 and 6) It is also reported in an extract of Applicant\u2019s Equifax \ncredit report of April 2020. (Exhibit A at Attachment 4). Of note, the June 2020 credit \nreport shows a past-due balance of $0. (Exhibit 6 at 2-3) He also submitted a June 2015 \ncollection letter with handwritten notes or annotations reflecting efforts to pay the \naccount. (Exhibit A at Attachment 3) Taken together, the evidence is sufficient to find \nthat Applicant paid the debt. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b concerns the largest debt, the more than $60,000 \ncollection account for the necessary medical care and treatment Applicant received at \nthe Army medical center. This account is being repaid via the administrative \ngarnishment order issued by the Treasury Department. He submitted documentation \nshowing repayment of the debt via the tools typically used by the federal government in \ncollection cases. He provided four earnings statements from his employer showing a \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeduction of $272.86 for garnishment once every two weeks. (Exhibit A at Attachments \n8, 9, 10, and 11) Year to date, as of October 23, 2020, the amount of $6,281.35 had \nbeen garnished from his wages. (Exhibit A at Attachment 11) In addition to the biweekly \nwage garnishment, he provided documentation showing that in October 2020 a federal \nincome tax refund for tax year 2019 was applied to this debt in the amount of $1,572.05. \n(Exhibit A at Attachments 1-2)  \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c concerns a $186 medical collection account. In his answer \nto the SOR and his November 2020 e-mail, Applicant explained he paid or settled this \naccount. He provided documentation showing he settled the account for the lesser \namount of $121 with the current account holder in April 2020. (Exhibit A at Attachments \n5 and 6) Consistent with his representation, the debt does not appear in the June 2020 \ncredit report provided by Department Counsel. (Exhibit 6) Taken together, the evidence \nis sufficient to find that Applicant settled the debt. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d concerns an $826 collection account placed by a bank \nthat is a major credit card company for many U.S. retail stores. Applicant provided \ndocumentation that he settled the account for the lesser amount of $578 with the current \naccount holder in about November 2020. (Exhibit A at Attachment 7) \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparations, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5  ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n6  Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case. \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, I note that the largest debt here is still in \ncollection and is being repaid through an administrative garnishment order issued by the \nDepartment of the Treasury. This size of the debt dwarfs the other three debts in the \nSOR, it will take time to repay at the biweekly rate of $279, and it was no doubt the \nprimary reason for issuance of the SOR. \nApplicant has sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated this debt by \nshowing it resulted from two circumstances largely beyond his control. The first was the \nheart attack followed by the billing mistake at the Army medical center that resulted in \nhim being classified as a non-insured civilian patient when he in fact had medical \ninsurance. Obviously, Applicant could not pick the time and place for his heart attack \nnor the medical facility where he was treated. The second was his insurer\u2019s refusal to \npay his claim for the necessary medical treatment and care received at the Army \nmedical center. A double whammy. Moreover, he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. After learning about the issue in March 2015, about 45 days after his \nheart attack, he then contacted both the Treasury Department and his insurer in an \neffort to resolve it. He subsequently took his foot off the gas pedal when the Treasury \nDepartment apparently did not timely respond to his request for a hearing and he should \nhave been more diligent in that regard, as he acknowledged being foolish thinking the \nproblem had went away. But given the totality of the circumstances, he did not conduct \nhimself irresponsibly. Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant has made \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to resolve the other three minor debts in \nthe SOR, which together amount to less than $2,000. He provided sufficient (although \nnot perfect) documentation to establish that he paid or settled those three accounts. \nPerhaps he could have acted with more diligence or speed, but it must be \nacknowledged that he resolved those three debts while at the same time being subject \nto the wage garnishment order. Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nCases such as this one are a good reminder for us all. Job loss, divorce, a string \nof failed investments, being a victim of fraud, getting hit by a risk you didn\u2019t see coming \nsuch as a medical emergency \u2013 to people in good financial shape these tend to be \nviewed as things that happen \u201cto other people.\u201d But it can happen to you. And given \nenough time, at least one likely will. No doubt some people are more susceptible than \nothers, but few are exempt from being humbled. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts and \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept.

He did not present information sufficient to support his claims that he has paid or \nis in the process of resolving most of his past-due debts. Accordingly, he has not mitigated \nthe security concerns about his financial problems and his request for continued access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 30, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have a security clearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn December 13, 2019, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich alleged facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR \nwere issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective \nfor all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on October 22, 2020. On December 7, 2020, Department Counsel \namended the SOR by adding an additional allegation. Applicant timely responded, but did \nnot object, to the additional allegation. I initially set this matter for hearing on December \n15, 2020; however, Applicant requested a continuance. Without objection, I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request for good cause shown and the hearing was rescheduled for January \n26, 2021. The parties appeared as scheduled. Applicant testified and presented Applicant \nExhibits (AX) A \u2013 F. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. The \nGovernment also provided a copy of the letter by which its exhibits were forwarded to \nApplicant in advance of the hearing, as required by paragraph E3.1.13 of the Directive. It \nis included in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1. DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 5, 2021. \nAdditionally, I left the record open after the hearing to receive additional relevant \ninformation from the Applicant. (Tr. 73 \u2013 74) On February 5, 2021, Applicant proffered AX \nG \u2013 J. The record closed on February 10, 2021, when Department Counsel waived \nobjection to admissibility of Applicant\u2019s post-hearings submissions. The Government\u2019s \nwaiver is included as HX 2. \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $33,996 for 22 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.v). In response, Applicant admitted with \nexplanations all of the SOR allegations. (Answer) As noted, above, Department Counsel \namended the SOR by adding as SOR 1.w an allegation that Applicant owes an additional \n$4,503.22 for a state tax lien entered against him in June 2018. Applicant admitted SOR \n1.w without explanation. Accordingly, the total amount of debt at issue is $38,499.22. The \nSOR amendment and Applicant\u2019s response to it are included as HX 3.

He has held a security clearance since 2008.

They have one \nchild, age 13. In 2013, Applicant became the legal guardian of two nephews, now ages \n20 and 17, after their mother died. In 2020, he took in another child whose parents \n(Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s brother-in-law and his wife) died within a year of each other. All four \nchildren still live with Applicant and his wife. (GX 1; Tr. 29 \u2013 31) \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of his most recent security clearance application, \nApplicant did not disclose any adverse financial information. However, credit reports \nobtained during his background investigation disclosed the debts alleged in the SOR. In \nSeptember 2018 and March 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator, with whom he discussed, inter alia, the debts alleged in the SOR. At \nApplicant\u2019s hearing, he testified that he was unaware of the debts at issue in this case \nuntil he received the SOR in December 2019. (GX 1; Tr. 28, 61 \u2013 63) \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant was enrolled at a local community \ncollege between July 1997 and May 2009. Between September 2006 and December \n2010, Applicant also studied for his associate\u2019s degree at a privately-owned technical \nschool. To finance his education at both schools, he obtained several student loans. The \ndebts alleged at SOR 1.a, 1.f, 1.q, and 1.v are student loans that became delinquent \nbetween 2011 and 2014. The debts alleged at SOR 1.a and 1.f are the result of \nconsolidations of some of his loans in 2016; however, Applicant has not made any \npayments on those loans since they were consolidated. (GX 2 \u2013 3; AX E; Tr. 28, 33, 43 \u2013 \n50) \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant claimed that the student \nloan debts in the SOR are no longer his responsibility. He cites a class action lawsuit \nbrought by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection against the technical school \nwhere he studied for his associate\u2019s degree. He further claimed that the suit resulted in a \nnullification of student loans obtained through the school. In support of his claim, he \nproffered a proposed \u201cStipulated Final Judgment and Order\u201d filed in federal court in \nSeptember 2020. The only creditor mentioned in that document is the one cited in SOR \n1.q. The document does not constitute a final order or other manner of resolution that \nwould relieve Applicant of any of the student loans addressed in the SOR. Further, \nApplicant testified that he also has a letter that supports his claim that he no longer is \nresponsible for SOR 1.a, 1.f, 1.q, and 1.v. Despite being allowed additional time after the \nhearing, he has not produced that letter.

He estimates that between 2014 and 2019, he \nspent a total of three weeks out of work due to illness, and that he lost about $5,400 in \nincome over that period. Applicant has always had employer-provided health insurance. \nThe debts alleged at SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g \u2013 1.p represent unpaid medical expenses \ncomprised of co-payments and other services not fully covered by his insurance plan.

He also claimed that he has \nbeen working with the creditor at SOR 1.r by making $188 payments each month. As to \nSOR 1.s, Applicant averred that he is making $100 monthly payments to bring that credit \ncard account current. In most cases, Applicant has based his claims on the absence of \ninformation about those debts in his most recent credit report. He also stated that he had \nadditional corroborating information he could submit; however, despite being allowed \nadditional time after the hearing, he has not produced that information. (Answer; AX E; \nTr. 22 \u2013 27, 50 \u2013 54) \nThe debt alleged at SOR 1.w is for a state tax lien obtained against Applicant in \nJune 2018. In response, Applicant presented information about a past-due EZ-Pass toll \nAccount. His position is that when the EZ-Pass became delinquent, the state converted \nit to a tax lien. He also averred that his father has paid $2,500 toward that debt and that \nApplicant now owes only $1,809 after making a $170 payment in January 2021. When \nasked to provide information that supports his claim that the state where he lives \nsomehow converts EZ-Pass debts to tax liens, Applicant produced only additional \ninformation about his EZ-Pass account. (Answer to SOR Amendment; GX 4; AX F \u2013 I; Tr. \n31 \u2013 32, 54 \u2013 57, 72) \nAside from a two-month period of unemployment after his employer lost a contract \nin January 2014, Applicant has been steadily employed (with insurance benefits) in the \nIT field for the past 13 years. His current job pays him an annual salary of $128,000 and \nthat he brings home about $5,200 each month. The job he had between May 2016 and \nNovember 2019 paid him a starting annual salary of $88,000. When he left to take his \ncurrent job, he was making $118,000 annually. Applicant also receives Social Security \nbenefits as assistance connected to the custody of his two nephews, and his wife earns \nabout $600 monthly as a waitress. Applicant did not provide any documentation of his \nearnings. (Tr. 19 \u2013 20, 37) \n \nIn addition to his medical challenges, Applicant claimed his financial problems \nhave been caused or exacerbated by his wife\u2019s marital infidelities, gambling, and \nsubstance abuse. He testified that those behaviors occurred between 2016 and 2019, \nand that aside from continued online gambling expenditures each month of less than $100 \nsince 2019, her conduct has not been an impediment to their finances. He did not explain, \nhowever, how his wife\u2019s conduct was related to the fact that most of the debts at issue in \nthis case became delinquent before 2016.

Since \n1996, after living in the home in which he was raised, Applicant has lived in a house \nowned and paid for by his father. Applicant\u2019s only living expenses are the money he \ncontributes for utilities and food. He estimates that he has less than $100 remaining each \nmonth. When he responded to the SOR, Applicant stated that part of his plan to resolve \nhis debts relied on his ability to pay off one of his car loans by June 2020 and reallocate \nthe $700 monthly car payment to resolve other debts. Applicant still owes $4,000 for that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncar loan because his car was repossessed in 2020 and the loan was refinanced so he \ncould keep the car. Applicant also indicated that he expected to apply his income tax \nrefunds, which he reports have averaged between $7,000 and $8,000, to debt payments; \nhowever, he did not provide any information that supports his testimony in this regard. \n(Answer; Tr. 21, 63 \u2013 65) \nIn December 2020, at the behest of his attorney in this case, Applicant engaged in \nonline financial counseling services. He credits those services with his ability to better \norganize his finances, the only identifiable example of which is a nascent monthly budget \nhe tracks on an eraser board in his house. Additionally, Applicant submitted several letters \nof recommendation and support in which he is described as reliable, trustworthy, \nknowledgeable in his profession, and honest. Applicant also is active in his community\u2019s \nsports programs as a coach and organizer. (Answer; AX A; Tr. 31, 38 \u2013 40) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred numerous delinquent or past-\ndue debts between about 2011 and 2018. As of the close of the background investigation, \nmost of those debts had not been paid or otherwise resolved. One of the delinquent debts \ndocumented by the Government\u2019s information is a state lien for a delinquent tax debt. \nThis information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is \narticulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nApplicant has been gainfully employed for at least 13 years. Since at least May \n2016, he has earned an annual salary that should have been sufficient to avoid most of \nthe delinquencies documented by the Government\u2019s information, especially in light of his \nrelatively low housing expenses and consistent medical insurance coverage. Additionally, \ndespite having additional time after the hearing, Applicant did not support his claims that \nhe has paid or otherwise resolved his debts. His response to information about his state \ntax lien was not credible. Applicant may be trying to resolve a delinquent or past-due EZ-\nPass account, but he did not corroborate his claim that collection of the EZ-Pass account \nis being enforced through a state tax lien. All of the foregoing requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nBy contrast, I have considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are multiple and recent, in that, they continue largely unresolved. \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant did not support his claims of \nrepayment and he did not provide information about other efforts to resolve his financial \nproblems. While his medical issues have presented challenges over the years, he has \nhad consistent medical insurance coverage and sufficient income that at least enabled \nhim to address unexpected expenses aside from co-payments. Applicant\u2019s claim that his \nfinances suffered because of his wife\u2019s behavior likewise is untenable. By his own \nadmission, those issues arose after he fell behind or defaulted on his student loans and \nmost of his other debts. They also have not been a problem since 2019. Even though his \nmedical issues and his wife\u2019s conduct were beyond his control, Applicant did not show \nthat he acted responsibly under those circumstances. This is especially true given the \nresources at his disposal since at least 2016. Although Applicant has used financial \ncounseling, it was only in the month before his hearing and he produced only minimal \ninformation about the extent of those services or how they have helped him resolve his \ndebts. Finally, Applicant\u2019s response to information about his state tax lien does not show \nthat he is repaying the debt or is otherwise working with the tax authority to resolve his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntax obligations. All of the foregoing precludes application of any of the mitigating \nconditions cited, above. \nThe Guideline F security concerns are not mitigated. I also have evaluated this \nrecord in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s \nassociate\u2019s speak well of his integrity, and he is active in his community. His willingness \nto step in and raise his nephews and another child reflects positively on his character and \ncommitment to family. Nonetheless, his failure to properly address his financial problems \ncontinues to undermine confidence in his judgment. The information he presented in \nresponse to the Government\u2019s case did not resolve the doubts raised thereby.
