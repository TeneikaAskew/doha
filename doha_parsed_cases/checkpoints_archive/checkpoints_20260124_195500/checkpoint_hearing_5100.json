Applicant had a successful\nNaval career until 1988, when his dereliction of duty and altering of a ship\u2019s log led to his\nnonjudicial punishment (NJP). Classified documents were utilized as part of Applicant\u2019s NJP.\nApplicant took a copy of the classified documents home in 1989, and stored them in his personal\nresidence until 2001, when he revealed his possession of the documents in an interview in\nconjunction with a government polygraph. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based\non his security violations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On March 21, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Security Violations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on June 1, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April\n4, 2007, scheduling the hearing for  May 3, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 16, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE\nThe Government offered six exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 6, and admitted without objections. The list of Government exhibits was marked as Hearing\nExhibit (HE) I. \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice be taken of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (HE II); 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 793 (HE III); and provisions of Department of Defense Directive 5220.22-M (HE IV).\nThere was no objection and administrative notice is taken of HE II to IV.\nApplicant testified and offered two exhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and\nB, and admitted without objections.\nThe Government made a verbal motion to amend the Statement of Reasons by deleting the\nword and figures \u201cMay 7, 2001\u201d on the second line of SOR \u00b6 1.a, and substituting \u201cJuly 6, 2001.\u201d\nThere was no objection, and the motion was granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married with two adult\nstepchildren. Applicant was commissioned in the United States Navy upon graduation from a service\nacademy. After commissioning, he was selected to attend a prestigious university, and obtained a\n\nTr. at 20-22; GE 1; AE A.\n2\nTr. at 25-26, 66; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR at 3; AE A.\n3\nGE 3, 4.\n4\nGE 3 at 1.\n5\n4\nMaster of Science degree. Applicant was promoted several times in the Navy. In 1988, he was a\nLieutenant Commander (0-4).  \n2\nApplicant was the Engineer Officer for a U.S. Navy nuclear submarine from 1986 to 1988.\nAs the Engineer Officer, Applicant was responsible for all aspects of the operation of the nuclear\nreactor and the engineering plant.  \n3\nOn October 23, 1988, the submarine was preparing to get underway. Applicant received a\ntelephone call from the Engineering Duty Officer who discovered a problem with a valve in the\nengineering plant. Navy records state that a problem of this magnitude warranted the immediate\nrelief of the Engineering Duty Officer and the Engineering Duty Petty Officer who were involved\nin the incident, and to immediately conduct a formal critique to inquire into the circumstances\nsurrounding the incident. Applicant did not direct that the above actions be taken. Applicant came\naboard the submarine later that evening. He reviewed the engineering log the next day. The log from\nthe day before read, \u201cvalve found open.\u201d Applicant changed the log to read, \u201cvalve found one turn\nopen.\u201d The problem was not brought to the attention of the Executive Officer or the Commanding\nOfficer until a senior enlisted person in the engineering department reported to the Executive Officer\non November 4, 1988, that a significant problem had occurred.  \n4\nAs a result of his actions in October 1988, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP)\non February 2, 1989, and was found to have committed violations of Article 92 of the Uniform Code\nof Military Justice (UCMJ), dereliction in the performance of his duties, and Article 134 of the\nUCMJ, willfully and unlawfully altering a public record, as follows:\nThat on or about 23 October 1988, he willfully failed to take appropriate corrective\naction upon learning of a significant problem in the engineering plant and that he\nwillfully failed to report this problem.\nThat on 24 October 1988 he willfully and unlawfully modified a 23 October 1988\nentry in the Engineering Log.5\nApplicant was awarded a punitive letter of admonition. The punitive letter of admonition was issued\non February 7, 1989, and included:\nThe nature of your violations of the UCMJ are indicative of your profound failure to\nbe forthright and honest in the performance of your duties. The tenets of mature\nleadership, unquestionable integrity, and sound moral character are the very\nfundamentals upon which the Navy\u2019s Officer Corps is founded. Your actions clearly\ndiminished the command climate within your ship and the respect which an officer\n\nGE 3.\n6\nId.\n7\nGE 4 at 6.\n8\nId. at 5.\n9\nId. at 4.\n10\n5\nmust instill in his subordinates. I cannot tolerate such conduct by a commissioned\nofficer and will not tolerate your specific conduct in this matter.6\nApplicant appealed his NJP on February 21, 1989. The appeal was denied. Applicant\u2019s appeal\nwas classified as \u201cCONFIDENTIAL,\u201d and not included in the report of nonjudicial punishment, in\norder to keep the report unclassified.7\nApplicant\u2019s Commanding Officer submitted a request to the Naval Military Personnel\nCommand on February 6, 1989, that Applicant be detached for cause from the submarine based upon\nmisconduct and unsatisfactory performance resulting from the events that led to his NJP. The\nCommanding Officer wrote:\n[Applicant] was derelict in the performance of his duties as Engineer Officer in\n[submarine name] from 23 October 1988 through 4 November 1988 when he\nwillfully failed to report a significant problem which occurred in the engineering\nplant on 23 October 1988 to the Executive Officer or Commanding Officer.\n[Applicant] was provided sufficient information to determine that a significant\nproblem had occurred on 23 October 1988 and 24 October 1988. The problem was\nnot brought to the attention of the Executive Officer or Commanding Officer until\na senior enlisted person in the engineering department reported to the Executive\nOfficer on 4 November 1988 that a significant problem had occurred.8\nApplicant provided a statement in response to the request for detachment for cause on\nFebruary 15, 1989, writing:\nThe statements contained in this letter are patently false. From the day I relieved until\nthe day I was relieved as Engineering Officer, [submarine name], I was 100 per cent\ndevoted to carrying out my duties and responsibilities as Engineer and to upholding\nthe highest tenets of the Naval Nuclear Power program. I did nothing to violate those\ntenets or abdicate those responsibilities.9\nApplicant\u2019s Commanding Officer forwarded an endorsement to Applicant\u2019s statement in\nresponse to the request for detachment for cause on February 28, 1989, writing, \u201cnot concurring with\n[Applicant\u2019s] statement. The statements in the basic letter are accurate.\u201d10\nApplicant submitted a statement on May 3, 1989, concerning the punitive letter of\nadmonition he received from his NJP. He wrote:\n\nGE 3.\n11\nGE 4 at 1.\n12\nTr. at 30, 45, 121.\n13\nGE 1 at 1; GE 2 at 1. Applicant\u2019s security clearance application of March 11, 2002, states that he moved to\n14\nhis current address in May 1989. I find the personnel security questionnaire of August 9, 1990, which lists the above\ninformation to be more accurate. It was closer to the move. Additionally, while in the Navy, Applicant worked in a\ndifferent geographic location than after he resigned his commission. \nGE 2 at 3. A small part of the document was cut off when photocopied, as indicated by the words in brackets.\n15\n6\nI made absolutely no effort to cover up, conceal, or lessen the severity of any\nproblems within the engineering plant while serving as Engineer Officer, [submarine\nname]. I did not foster an attitude or condone a climate which would tolerate, for a\nsingle instant, such actions. The implication that as Engineer Officer, responsible\nfor upholding the highest tenets of integrity and leadership in the nuclear navy, I\nwillfully disregarded those principles for one day out of an outstanding career as a\nsafe, reliable, aggressive submariner and naval nuclear engineer is implicitly\ncontradictory and unfathomable. In a manner entirely uncharacteristic of someone\nattempting to withhold information or deny culpability I zealously pursued the\nprosecution of fact and the notification of others concerning the problem which\nultimately resulted in [letter of admonition].\n[Submarine name]\u2019s Commanding Officer felt the allegations raised by the problem\nwere groundless. He found no basis for questioning my integrity or for charging\ndereliction, much less willful dereliction, following his in-depth scrutinization of the\nkey events.11\nThe detachment for cause request was approved by the Naval Military Personnel Command\non October 13, 1989.  \n12\nApplicant resigned his commission in the Navy in October 1989. He has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since he left the Navy, and has held a security clearance since then. Applicant\nreceived security training on an annual basis while in the Navy. He also received annual security\ntraining from his current employer.  Applicant moved in October 1989, to the same geographic area\n13\nin which he currently lives and works. He moved to his current residence in about May 1990.14\nApplicant submitted a personnel security questionnaire on August 9, 1990. Question 17.a\nasked:\nHave you ever been arrested, charged, cited, or held by Federal, state, or local law\nenforcement or juvenile authorities [section missing] whether the citation was\ndropped or dismissed, or you were found not guilty? (Include all courts-martial or\nnon-judicia[l] [section missing] while in military service. You may exclude minor\ntraffic violations for which a fine of $100 or less was imp[osed] [section missing].15\n\nId. This information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in assessing\n16\nApplicant\u2019s credibility, when analyzing the \u201cwhole person,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating conditions.\nGE 5.\n17\n7\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question.  \n16\nIn 2001, Applicant was investigated for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information\n(SCI). The investigation process involved polygraphs and interviews in conjunction with the\npolygraph. Applicant was interviewed on May 7, 2001. A signed statement was not taken. The report\nof the security representative/polygrapher who interviewed Applicant, states:\nSUBJECT was relieved for cause while serving in the Navy. HE was serving aboard\nthe [submarine name] in 1989 when HE was the Engineer of the boat. HIS crew was\ngoing through the procedures of lighting off the power plant when they left a valve\nopen instead of closing it. No damage was done but because two other boat crews\nhad done the same thing after a message had been sent cautioning crews to be careful\nthe Navy took punitive action against the Engineer of the Boat, SUBJECT. HE was\nnot aboard the boat when the incident occurred, but as HE was Chief Engineer HE\nreceived non-judicial punishment of a Letter of Reprimand and relieved of HIS\nposition. HE resigned his commission shortly thereafter. HE denied any other\npunitive action taken against HIM. (capitals in original)17\nApplicant had another interview on July 5, 2001. The Report of Interview (ROI) from May\n7, 2001, was reviewed with Applicant, and he verified it as being accurate and correct. There was\nno signed statement on this occasion either. The ROI of the July 5, 2001 interview states:\nSUBJECT received non-judicial punishment and was relieved of HIS position in\nOctober 1989, after one of HIS crewmembers failed to properly secure a high-pressure\nvalve that was part of the nuclear power plant. SUBJECT advised HE was punished\nbecause HE was in charge of the crewmember that failed to follow the standard\noperating procedure. SUBJECT advised that during his non-judicial punishment\nhearing HE took several notes and made several photocopies of the procedures for\noperating a naval nuclear power plant. SUBJECT advised that the information that\nwas contained in HIS notes and photocopies was classified. SUBJECT advised that\nsince his hand written notes did not go through a classification officer, HE believes\nthe classification of the notes and photocopies are \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u201d.  SUBJECT\nadvised that the notes and photocopies that HE had during the hearing measured\napproximately one inch thick.  SUBJECT took the documents to HIS personal\nresidence subsequent to HIS non-judicial punishment hearing and currently has them\nstored in a box in HIS closet. SUBJECT advised that he was disgruntle[d] with the\nU.S. Navy, for punishing HIM for a mistake that HE personally did not make.\nSUBJECT advised that HE resigned HIS commission with the U.S. Navy after they\nrelieved HIM of HIS command. SUBJECT advised that HE kept the classified\ndocuments at HIS residence because HE had a personal vendetta against the U.S.\nNavy. SUBJECT denied providing the classified documentation to anyone or\ncompromising the information in any fashion. SUBJECT denied committing any acts\n\nId.\n18\nTr. at 54-56, 111; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n19\nTr. at 111.\n20\nGE 5.\n21\nGE 6.\n22\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR at 2-3.\n23\n8\nto hurt the U.S. Navy or the U.S. Government . . .  SUBJECT advised at the end of the\ninterview, HE knew it was a violation of the law to have classified information at HIS\nresidence. (capitals in original)18\nOn about July 6, 2001, Special Agents of the FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative\nService (NCIS) went to Applicant\u2019s house. Applicant granted them permission to search and they\nseized the documents that Applicant discussed with the interviewer the day before.  There was no\n19\ndocumentary evidence presented from the FBI, NCIS, or other government agency, that the\ndocuments seized from Applicant\u2019s house were classified. Applicant testified that he did not receive\nanything from any agency informing him whether the documents contained classified information.20\nOn September 30, 2002, a Notification of Denial of Access to Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation (SCI) was issued against Applicant based upon the information contained in the ROI\nof July 5, 2001.  On December 13, 2002, the decision to deny SCI access became final as Applicant\n21\n\u201cchose not to appeal the denial decision.\u201d22\nApplicant submitted a response to the Statement of Reasons on June 1, 2006. In his response,\nhe described the events leading to his NJP:\nDuring routine preparations for starting the ship\u2019s propulsion reactor prior to leaving\nport, the onboard engineering duty section made a procedural error that temporarily\nrendered one of several reactor control systems ineffective for several minutes - in\nshort, following a system test, an air system vent valve was left open instead of being\nshut. The duty section discovered the error a short time later and corrected it.\nAccording to policies in place at the time, such a procedural error required an\ninvestigation and a report to higher authority. The error was not properly reported to\nme, as the Chief Engineer, or the ship\u2019s Commanding Officer. Several days later,\nupon learning of the events, I initiated an investigation and upon return to port\ninformed the ship\u2019s parent squadron engineering staff.\nAs Chief Engineer I was responsible for every aspect of the operation of the ship\u2019s\nnuclear reactor and its engineering plant. As such during the subsequent investigation\nI was held and accepted full responsib[ility] for the incident.23\n\nId. at 3.\n24\nId. \n25\nId. at 1.\n26\nTr. at 104.\n27\nTr. at 34, 101; GE 4 at 6.\n28\nTr. at 33.\n29\n9\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant discussed the interview with the polygrapher in July\n2001, and the search of his residence the following day. He stated that in 1989, the squadron staff\nprovided him with \u201cwhat was referred to as [his] copy of the investigating officer\u2019s report.\u201d  He\n24\nwrote that during his discussion with the polygrapher:\nI commented that I probably had a copy of the investigating officer\u2019s report. At this\npoint I also realized and volunteered that the procedural steps outlined in the report\nconcerning the incident might have been classified \u201cconfidential - formerly restricted\ndata\u201d although I did not recall exactly what was in the copy of the report the Navy\nhad given me. In general, however, it is my recollection now that information\nconcerning nearly all aspects of operating a naval nuclear power plant would have\nbeen classified or restricted in 1989. The following day, an agent from the FBI and\nan agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, visited my home, where we\nsearched through the file boxes and located the investigative report sealed in the same\nbox it had been for the last eleven or twelve years. I then voluntarily gave the agents\nmy copy of the incident report.25\nApplicant also wrote in his response to the SOR:\n[D]uring each security clearance investigation and each periodic update to my TOP\nSECRET security clearance, I have fully disclosed the reactor incident, the non-\njudicial punishment I received in 1989 from the Navy resulting from the incident, and\nthe command climate and events surrounding the incident.26\nApplicant repeated the above in his testimony at his hearing.  As addressed above, this was not a\n27\ntrue statement as Applicant did not report the NJP on his 1990 personnel security questionnaire.\nApplicant provided contradictory or inaccurate explanations about the incidents at his\nhearing. He testified that he was contacted by the Executive Officer three to four days after he\nchanged the log, vice the approximately 11 days indicated in the Navy records.  \n28\nApplicant testified he received the telephone call about \u201cwhat I thought at the time was a\nsimple valve alignment.\u201d  He testified that when he read the log the next day, he noted an entry that\n29\nindicated a valve had been open. He remembered the telephone call that stated a valve had been\n\nTr. at 34.\n30\nTr. at 65.\n31\nTr. at 101.\n32\nTr. at 35.\n33\nTr. at 39, 52-56, 75, 87, 94-95, 109.\n34\nTr. at 40, 74, 86.\n35\n10\npartially open, so he changed the log.  Applicant was later asked by Department Counsel as it relates\n30\nto the safety of the plant, if there was a distinction between a valve on a high pressure system being\none turn open or fully open, to which Applicant responded, \u201c[p]robably not on a large ship.\u201d31\nApplicant testified that when he found out the truth about the valve, he realized that a significant\nevent had occurred. Applicant later testified that the information he initially received from the duty\nofficer was not sufficient to initiate an investigation.  He testified that after he conducted his\n32\ninvestigation, he recommended to the Commanding Officer that the incident be reported, but the CO\ndid not report it, which Applicant felt was improper:\nI felt that the guidelines at the time clearly said that this incident should be reported\nto higher authority. That\u2019s part of how the Navy nuclear program operates. These sort\nof incidents, no matter how small, get reported. They get aggregated and become\nlessons learned for the entire fleet. That\u2019s how the navy nuclear program operates;\nby self reporting.33\nApplicant never fully explained if as he first testified, that from a safety standpoint, there was\nno distinction between a valve one turn open and fully open, why the partially open valve did not\nconstitute \u201ca significant event,\u201d which would have triggered an investigation. He also did not\nadequately address why it was appropriate for him to change a log entry made by another officer.\nApplicant denied having a \u201cvendetta\u201d against the Navy, and he denied telling the polygrapher\nthat he did. He denied telling the polygrapher that he was storing classified documents. He denied\ntaking any notes during his NJP. He stated there were no notes among the files that were seized. He\ntestified he did not deliberately transport and store classified information at his residence.34\nApplicant testified that immediately prior or right after the NJP, he received a copy of a series\nof documents that were used at his hearing. Although the response to the SOR clearly states it was\na copy of the investigating officer\u2019s report, Applicant testified that he did not remember exactly what\ndocumentation he received, or what was seized in July 2001.  \n35\nIn the response to the SOR, Applicant stated that it was his recollection that information\nconcerning nearly all aspects of operating a naval nuclear power plant would have been classified\nor restricted in 1989. At the hearing, he was asked if just about everything relating to the\nmaintenance and operation of a nuclear power submarine is classified, to which he responded, \u201cI\n\nTr. at 77.\n36\nTr. at 78.\n37\nTr. at 80.\n38\nTr. at 82.\n39\nThis information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s\n40\ncredibility, when analyzing the \u201cwhole person,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating conditions.\nTr. at 29; AE A.\n41\nAE B.\n42\nTr. at 117-118, 122, 127, 144-145.\n43\n11\ndon\u2019t know if that is a fact or not.\u201d  He was asked if the technical manuals and procedure manuals\n36\nfor the nuclear reactor had at least a confidential classification, to which he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know\nexactly.\u201d  He eventually admitted they were \u201cprobably\u201d confidential.  He further testified:\n37\n38\nI have no reason to believe what I was provided at the time [w]as classified. It was\nnot described as classified. It was not marked as classified. I didn\u2019t even know to this\nday whether it was classified or not.39\nAfter considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant did have classified documents in his\npossession from about February 1989 to July 2001. I further find that Applicant knew the documents\nwere classified when he first bought them to his residence. I find there was no disclosure or\ncompromise of the classified documents. I also find that Applicant transported the classified\ndocuments when he moved in October 1989, and again when he moved in May 1990.\nI find Applicant intentionally falsified his personnel security questionnaire in 1990, when he\nfailed to list his NJP. I find Applicant misrepresented or minimized his actions aboard the submarine\nwhen he was questioned by the polygraphers in May and July 2001, in his response to the SOR, and\nat his hearing. I further find that Applicant provided false testimony at his hearing when he denied\nintentionally taking home and storing classified documents.  \n40\nPrior to the incidents leading to his NJP, Applicant\u2019s Navy record was superb. In addition\nto his outstanding fitness reports, Applicant was awarded two Navy Achievement Medals and three\nNavy Commendation Medals. His Commanding Officer recommended him for assignment as\nExecutive Officer and eventual command of a submarine, and for accelerated promotion to\nCommander.  His performance evaluations since he joined his current company in 1989, have also\n41\nbeen excellent.  A supervisor from his company testified that Applicant is an excellent manager,\n42\nextremely technically competent, with very good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He stated\nApplicant complies with all internal corporate regulations and security regulations, and recommends\nApplicant maintain his security clearance. An executive with his company testified Applicant is\nreliable with good judgment. Applicant has not had any security incidents involving his employer.43\nNeither of Applicant\u2019s character witnesses had complete knowledge of the events leading to\nApplicant\u2019s NJP, or of his security infractions.\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n49\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the\nDirective.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline K: Security Violations\n\nISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006).\n50\nISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 5 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998).\n51\n13\nNoncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness,\nwillingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.\nBased on all the evidence, I find Security Violations Disqualifying Condition (SV DC)\nE2.A11.1.2.2 (Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence) applies. Applicant\nbrought classified documents to his residence in 1989, without authorization, and maintained them\nuntil July 2001.\nSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access\nto classified information, as they raise very serious questions about an applicant's suitability for\naccess to classified information. Once it is established that Applicant has committed a security\nviolation, he has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that he should be entrusted with classified\ninformation. Because security violations strike at the very heart of the industrial security program,\nan Administrative Judge must give any claims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny. In many\nsecurity clearance cases, applicants are denied a clearance for having an indicator of a risk that they\nmight commit a security violation (e.g., alcohol abuse, delinquent debts or drug use). Security\nviolation cases reveal more than simply an indicator of risk.  The frequency and duration of the\n50\nsecurity violations are also aggravating factors.51\nThe Security Violations Mitigating Conditions (SV MC) that could mitigate security\nconcerns include actions that: SV MC E2.A11.1.3.1 (Were inadvertent); SV MC E2.A11.1.3.2 (Were\nisolated or infrequent); SV MC E2.A11.1.3.3 (Were due to improper or inadequate training); and\nSV MC E2.A11.1.3.4 (Demonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of security\nresponsibilities). \nApplicant intentionally transported and maintained classified documents without\nauthorization. SV MC E2.A11.1.3.1 does not apply. Applicant transported the classified documents\nto his residence in about February 1989. He transported them again when he moved in October 1989,\nand again when he moved in May 1990. He kept them at his current residence until they were seized\nin July 2001. Because he transported them several times and kept them for more than twelve years,\nI cannot give Applicant the total benefit of SV MC E2.A11.1.3.2. There was no evidence of\nimproper or inadequate training. SV MC E2.A11.1.3.3 does not apply.\nApplicant has not been involved in any security incidents with his employer. They believe\nhe possesses a positive attitude towards the discharge of his security responsibilities. SV MC\nE2.A11.1.3.4 partially applies. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information.\n\n14\nI have considered the Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC), including PC DC\nE2.A5.1.2.1 (Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers,\nneighbors, and other acquaintances), PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (Personal conduct or concealment of\ninformation that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, such\nas engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail), and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (A\npattern of dishonesty or rules violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement\nmade between the individual and the agency). I conclude the above disqualifying conditions apply\nto the incidents which led to Applicant\u2019s NJP, and to his security violations.\nI have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC), especially PC\nMC E2.A5.1.3.5 (The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress). The passage of time has lessened Applicant\u2019s\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. I also find Applicant significantly reduced his\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress when he informed the polygrapher that he possessed\nclassified material, and it was seized the next day. PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 is established.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\nA history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\nApplicant transported classified documents to his residence without authorization in 1989.\nHe moved them later in 1989, and again in 1990. He kept them at his residence until federal agents\nseized them in July 2001. Applicant\u2019s actions constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(f):\nWhoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any\ndocument, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic\nnegative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information,\nrelating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be\nremoved from its proper place of custody . . . , or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or\ndestroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from\nits proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or\nstolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft,\nabstraction, or destruction to his superior officer- - - Shall be fined under this title or\nimprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\nApplicant was a military officer in 1989, and subject to the UCMJ, when he transported the\nclassified materials without authorization. I find his actions regarding the classified materials also\nconstituted a violation of Article 133 of the UCMJ, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\nI am not satisfied that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, which criminalizes embezzlement\nand theft of U.S. Government property. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant stole the\nclassified documents, as opposed to simply making a photocopy, or having them handed to him. \nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or\nadmissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged), and CC\n\n15\nDC E2.A10.1.2.2 (A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) both apply to Applicant\u2019s\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(f) and Article 133 of the UCMJ. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was not recent), CC MC\nE2.A10.1.3.2 (The crime was an isolated incident), and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (There is clear\nevidence of successful rehabilitation). The gravamen of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(f) is Applicant\u2019s actions\nin 1989, when he transported the classified documents. I find CC MC E2.A10.1.3.1 is applicable.\nWhile the crime occurred in 1989, Applicant maintained the fruits of the crime, the classified\ndocuments, without authorization until July 2001. When determining whether Applicant\u2019s criminal\nact was an isolated incident, I also considered Applicant\u2019s violations of the UCMJ which led to his\nNJP, which are criminal acts. I also considered Applicant\u2019s intentional falsifications to the U.S.\nGovernment, as addressed above. Under these circumstances, I conclude the crime was not an\nisolated incident, and there is no clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2\nand CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 do not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered all the evidence, and every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nApplicant had an outstanding record in the Navy until he committed the misconduct which\nled to his nonjudicial punishment. Applicant\u2019s dereliction of duty no longer serves as a major\nconcern. His altering of the log is a greater concern, as it directly relates to Applicant\u2019s honesty,\njudgment, and truthfulness, and is part of a larger pattern. Applicant compounded his lack of\njudgment by taking home classified documents, transporting them twice, and storing them until July\n2001. I considered the reports of Applicant\u2019s interview by the polygraphers. Since the interviewers\nor other authenticating witnesses did not testify, I had to look to the four corners of the documents,\nand compare the reports with the other evidence in the case, and with Applicant\u2019s testimony.\nApplicant denied the statements in the report that he was disgruntled with the Navy and that he had\na vendetta against the Navy. Having reviewed all the evidence, and particularly Applicant\u2019s own\nstatements in GE 3 and 4, I am convinced that in 1989, Applicant was disgruntled with the Navy,\nand he did not feel he received fair treatment. I believe this was the motivation for his taking home\nthe classified documents.\nApplicant has not been arrested or charged with anything since his 1989 NJP. He has been\nas successful in his post-Navy career as he was in the Navy prior to his NJP. He is a well respected\nsenior level employee of a defense contractor. I take this all into consideration under the whole\nperson. I also considered that Applicant falsified a security questionnaire in 1990, and provided false\ninformation in his response to the SOR, and in his testimony at his hearing. When all the evidence\nis considered, I find Applicant to be a person who is willing to bend or break the rules when he feels\nit is in his best interest, be it altering a log, taking home and storing classified materials, submitting\n\n16\na falsified security questionnaire, or providing false or misleading statements in response to the SOR\nand in his testimony at his hearing.\nI have weighed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluated all the evidence in\nthe context of the whole person. Applicant committed a twelve-year-long security violation. Having\ncommitted a security violation, Applicant has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that he should\nbe entrusted with classified information. I am required to give any claims of reform and\nrehabilitation strict scrutiny. I conclude Applicant has established several mitigating conditions, but\nthey were insufficient to overcome the overriding security concerns. Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on his security violations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline K:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant owes approximately $35,000 in outstanding tax obligations to the federal and state\ngovernment. His tax liens date from 1994 until 2005. He has not made any effort to pay these liens\n\n2\nnor has he developed a repayment plan. He is paying  his child support arrearage of $13,000. He has\nnot mitigated or overcome the government's security concerns regarding his security eligibility based\non financial considerations. Clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nApplicant Ex. A is a Response to guidelines, dated December 18, 2006; Applicant Ex. B is a receipt from cable,\n2\ndated December 21, 2006; Applicant Ex. C is a Child Support Enforcement payment history, dated September 1, 2006.\nApplicant's response to the SOR, dated April 25, 2006.\n3\n Government Ex. 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86)), dated December 6, 2004 at 1-8.\n4\nId.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 20, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On January 31,\n2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\n1\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth\nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. DOHA\nrecommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. In a sworn statement, dated April 25, 2006,\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThis matter was assigned to me on November 22, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on\nDecember 1, 2006, scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2006. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted three exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE)\n1-3. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant submitted three exhibits\nwhich were marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits A through C.  The exhibits\n2\nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on December 28, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline F 1.a. through 1.h. He denied 1. i., and\n1.j. as to the amount of the debt.  Those admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated\n3\nas findings of fact. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor who graduated from high school\nin 1965. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1967, and was honorably discharged in 1970.  \n4\nAs a disabled veteran, he receives a monthly pension of $364. Veterans' benefits financed his\nundergraduate degree in 1978. He expects to complete the Executive Master of Business\nAdministration program in 2007. He was granted a security clearance in 1975.5\n\nTr.37, 38. 39.\n6\nTr. 40.\n7\nApplicant Ex. C; and Tr. 41\n8\nTr. 52.\n9\nTr.41-53.\n10\nTr.54.\n11\n4\nApplicant married in 1969. As a result of that marriage, he had three children. Two of his\nchildren died. The remaining child is disabled. The first marriage ended in 1979. His second\nmarriage ended in divorce in 1988. He has two children from that marriage. His third marriage lasted\nfrom 1991 until 1995.  \n6\nAs a result of the divorces, Applicant had child support obligations since 1988. He paid\napproximately $1,000 a month in child support for the children from his second marriage.  He was\n7\ncurrent with child support in one state but fell behind in the state of Maryland in October 1988. The\nchildren are now emancipated. However, Applicant has a child support arrearage. Since 2002, he has\npaid $357 a month toward a current arrearage of approximately $12,518. The arrearage listed in the\nSOR was $18,604. Applicant has reduced his arrearage in the past years from $30,000 to the current\namount.8\nApplicant worked for the federal government as a guard from 1970 until 1975. He left the\nfederal government to work for a private company as an auditor until 1978. After that, he worked\nfor another company until 1986. In 1986 he had a full time job with an engineering firm, but was\nthen unemployed for approximately two years. He worked on an independent basis after that. His\nincome dropped from $50,000 to $25,000 in 1988. From that time, he worked on a temporary basis\nfor various companies or as an independent contractor.  At times he had no income. In 1990, he\n9\nworked as a consultant for one year. His work was sporadic after that until 1995. He had a full time\nposition which lasted until 1996. He did not have another full time job until 2000, but worked from\n1997 on a contractual basis. Since 2002, he has been an independent contractor. However he lists\nhis position as a senior auditor for a defense contractor since 2004 to the present on his security\napplication. His work has not required him to have a security clearance.10\nIn 1992, Applicant first had difficulties paying his taxes.   He had no money to pay his taxes\n11\nas well as the child support. He made a decision to pay child support when he could, and allow the\ntaxes to remain unpaid. He contacted the IRS a few years ago, and explained his situation. The tax\nliens  increased in amount, and he currently owes between $25,000 and $35,000 in unpaid tax bills.\nHe claims his tax liens are in a suspense account, and lets the IRS know when he can make any\npayments. Thus far, he has not made any payments due to lack of money. He produced no evidence\nto support his contention. He expects to address the tax issue in 2007, if he gets the full time\n\nTr. 55.\n12\nTr.58.\n13\nApplicant Ex. B.\n14\nTr. 58.\n15\n5\ncontractor job and has a stable income. He has not settled with the IRS because he cannot commit\nto a certain amount.12\nFor many years, Applicant borrowed money from family and friends for three or four months\na year to make ends meet. He still does this and did not disclose the amount he owes.  When he\n13\nworks, he pays his family and friends. His current income is between $3,000 and $4,000 a month\n(gross). His monthly expenses are approximately $2,500. His net remainder varies. On his security\napplication he lists his position as a senior auditor with the defense contractor from 2004 until the\npresent.\nIn December 2006, Applicant paid the collection account listed in SOR, \u00b6 1.j.  He is current\n14\nwith his other bills and taxes. He denies a license suspension for child support at any time. He is now\npaying monthly on his child support arrearage and has lowered the amount significantly since the\nissuance of the SOR.\nApplicant has diabetes but his health is good and does not prevent him from his work. He\nbelieves age discrimination is the cause for the sporadic employment. He also states that he has\ndifficulty keeping a job because once he gets a company on a sound financial track, they no longer\nneed him and he has to find another job.15\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n16\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The government\n16\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n17\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n18\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n19\ndecision.20\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n21\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n22\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n23\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n24\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F Financial Considerations\n\n7\nThe government has established its case under Guideline F. Applicant has a history of  unpaid\nfederal and state tax liens since 1994. He has a child support arrearage. Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) E.2.A6.1.2.1. (a history of not meeting financial obligations ) and\nFC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to this case.\nA security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated in several ways. Applicant's\ndebt problems have been ongoing for a number of years, and are not recent. He admits borrowing\nmoney from family and friends three or four months a year. Thus, he has not established a mitigating\ncondition under Financial Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (the behavior was not recent).\nApplicant incurred his debt partly as a result of his divorces and change in tax status. He also\nhad child support to pay for his children. His employment has been sporadic over the years. While,\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol) applies in part, it is not determinative. While his divorce, child support, and sporadic\nemployment are events partially beyond his control, they occurred a long time ago. His second\ndivorce and child support stem from 1988. This does not explain or justify why he did not pay\nanything on his long overdue taxes. \nHe has not received counseling for his financial problems. Since receiving the SOR, Applicant\npaid his one delinquent account. Applicant is an auditor and is aware of his financial problems, but\nhe still owes approximately  $35,000 for federal and state taxes, with penalties and interest accruing.\nHe made a conscious choice not to pay his federal and state taxes on an annual basis. Even after the\nIRS filed tax liens against Applicant, giving him notice of indebtedness, Applicant made no effort to\nresolve his tax issues. Since 2002, he is current on the child support arrearage, but there is a\nsubstantial amount of debt remaining. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (the person has received financial\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control) does not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. Security\nclearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past\ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common\nsense assessment of a person's judgment and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the\n\"whole person\" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and\nomissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.\nIn my evaluation of the record, I have carefully considered each piece of evidence in the\ncontext of the Directive guidelines that were generally applicable or might be applicable to the facts\nof this case.  Applicant is a veteran who served his country. However, Applicant still owes significant\nmoney on back taxes. He chose not to pay the taxes and address the child support arrearage. He\nacknowledges borrowing money from family and friends when he does not work. His income is\nsporadic. I am not persuaded by the totality of the evidence that Applicant has shown that he will pay\nhis overdue tax debt. He has not yet developed a repayment plan. While his expressed desire to pay\nin 2007 if he gains stable employment is admirable, this is not sufficient.  Under the whole person\nconcept, I conclude that Applicant has not sustained his burden of proof in demonstrating his\neligibility to hold a security clearance. \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

His father and parents-in-law are Iranian\ncitizens. Applicant has not mitigated the security concern under foreign preference and foreign\ninfluence. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn February 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nReview Program dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive), issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference), and Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied,\nor revoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, dated March 11, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR and\nelected to have his case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government\u2019s File of Relevant Materials (FORM) dated February 28, 2007.  Applicant\n1\nreceived the FORM on March 6, 2007, and was given an opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterials in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit a written response. The\ncase was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all factual allegations of the SOR pertaining to foreign preference under\nGuideline C (subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c. and 1. d) but denied the underlying concern. He admitted\nallegations to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 2.b. through 2.f) except allegation\n2.a.  Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review\n2\nof the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:\n\nApplicant\u2019s SF 86 lists Herndon, Va. as his birth place. However, in his Answer to the SOR and other\n3\ninformation, he states Iran.

Applicant presented no evidence concerning his father\u2019s status.\nId. at 2.\n9\n3\nApplicant is 52 years old and has worked as a software engineer since 1992. He was born and\nraised in Iran , earning a Bachelor of Science in 1977.  He attended a U.S. University from 1978\n3\n4\nuntil December 1980, and received a master\u2019s degree in 1981. In 1989, he married an Iranian woman.\nHe is now seeking a clearance for a position as a software engineer in the United States (U.S.) with\na defense contractor.5\nApplicant emigrated to the U.S. more than 28 years ago. In 1990, he became a naturalized\nU. S. citizen and received a U.S. passport in 2001. After being granted a U.S. passport, he was issued\nan Iranian passport on March 15, 2001. He used his Iranian passport when he traveled to Iran in June\n2001.  As of April 7, 2005, he still possessed an Iranian passport that was issued in March 2001. This\n6\npassport expired in March 2006, but is still in his possession. In his 2004 security clearance\napplication he did not consider himself a dual citizen.7\nOver the years, Applicant traveled to Iran in 1992 and June 2001. His father and parents-in-\nlaw still reside in and are Iranian citizens. His father  is a retired employee of the government of Iran.\n8\nApplicant\u2019s mother is deceased. He has no other family left in Iran.  He provides financial support\n9\nto his father \u201cwhen possible.\u201d Applicant\u2019s father resides with him in the U.S. approximately six\nmonths a year. Applicant\u2019s in-laws reside with him in the U.S. approximately three months ever year.\nOther than identifying information as noted on his security clearance application (SF-86), Applicant\nhas provided no information regarding his family. Other than acknowledging his possession of an\nIranian passport that expired in March 2006, Applicant failed to provide any pertinent facts in\nresponse to the SOR.\nThe government submitted information regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran. It notes that\nthe U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since April 7, 1980, following the November\n1979 Iranian student occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran and the hostage taking of 52\nAmericans, which was supported by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran\u2019s \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d at the\n\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Background Note: Iran, dated October 2006\n10\n(Background Note) at 7.\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Consular Information Sheet: Iran, dated April 3,\n11\n2006, (Consular Information Sheet) at 1.\nReports on Terrorism at 171 and 173.\n12\nId.\n13\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Travel Warning: Iran, date October 10, 2006,\n14\n(Travel Warning) at 1.\nReports on Human Rights Practices at 1-11.\n15\n4\ntime.  Today, Iran is a \u201ctheocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key\n10\npower structures\u201d and \u201cultimate political authority is vested in a learned religious scholar.\u201d11\nThe U.S. has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, one of a half dozen countries,\nand characterizes it as \u201cthe most active state sponsor.\u201d  As a state sponsor of terrorism, Iran provides\n12\ncritical support to non-state terrorist groups. Iran regularly provides \u201cunique safe haven, substantial\nresources and guidance to terrorists organizations. As a state sponsor of terrorism with nuclear\nambitions, Iran poses \u201ca grave WMD terrorism threat.\u201d13\nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens, particularly those born in Iran, to\nconsider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. Iranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, and the children\nof such persons, are considered Iran citizens by the Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize\ndual citizenship. As a result, U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the\nIranian government.14\nIran\u2019s dismal and worsening human rights record presents a further threat to the U.S.,\nespecially since large numbers of Iranians emigrated to the U.S. after Khomeini\u2019s 1979 Islamic\nrevolution, and these immigrants often left behind family members in Iran. The government of Iran,\nparticularly its regular and paramilitary security forces, have committed \u201cnumerous, serious human\nrights abuses\u201d against the Iranian people. The abuses include political killings and incarceration,\nreligious kidnaping and persecution, torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of detainees,\narbitrary arrests and detentions, the execution of minors, and the denial of due process. Iran\u2019s\nsecurity forces often target family members of political prisoners for harassment purposes.  \n15\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility For Access\nTo Classified Information, sets forth the criteria which must be applied when determining security\nclearance eligibility. The adjudicative guidelines specifically distinguish between those factors that\nare considered in denying or revoking an employee\u2019s request for access to classified information\n(Disqualifying Conditions), and those factors that are considered in granting an employee\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions). By acknowledging that individual\n\nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 517 (1988).\n16\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n17\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 11, 1997).\n18\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3,\u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n5\ncircumstances of each case are always different, the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist\nan administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.\nThe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at meritorious\ndecisions. Section E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all\nappropriate variables in a case as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the conduct of the\napplicant and the circumstances in any case, the factors an administrative judge should consider\npursuant to the concept are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtecting national security is the paramount concern in reaching a decision in any case, and\nis dependent upon the primary standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly consistent with\nthe interest of national security. Granting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information\nis predicated on a high degree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under\nthe Directive must include consideration of not just the actual risk of disclosure of such information,\nbut also consideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information in any aspect of his or her life. Any doubt about whether an applicant should\nbe allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting classified\ninformation.  The decision to deny a security clearance request to an individual is not necessarily\n16\na determination of the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met\n17\nthe strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nIn accordance with the Directive, the government bears the initial burden of proof in the\nadjudicative process to establish conditions which indicate it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  When the\n18\ngovernment meets this burden, a heavy burden of persuasion then falls on the applicant to present\nevidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of\nthe government, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance.19\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence submitted in this matter, the following\nadjudicative guidelines are appropriate for evaluation with regard to the facts of this case:\n\n6\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate\na preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence: A security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s\nimmediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound\nby affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to\nduress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial\ninterests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an\nindividual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nThe Guideline C and B disqualifying and mitigating conditions, applicable to this case, are\nset forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below. For clarity, I will discuss each separately.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nstandards, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with\nrespect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nForeign Preference\nBased on all the evidence Foreign Preference (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.2 (possession and/or use\nof a foreign passport) apply. Applicant obtained an Iranian passport after becoming a naturalized\nU.S. citizen. On two occasions he traveled on his Iranian passport, rather than his U.S. passport, to\nIran, so he would benefit from the protection of the Iranian government toward its citizens and not\nhave to comply with the procedures required for non-citizens. Applicant has exercised dual\ncitizenship by reaping the benefits afforded Iranian citizens when entering and exiting the country.\nApplicant\u2019s passport expired in 2006 and he continues to retain it in his possession. Applicant has\nnot surrendered or attempted to surrender the passport to the appropriate authority. I find Applicant\nexercised dual citizenship with Iran beyond his parents\u2019 citizenship or birth there. In accordance with\na memorandum issued by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communication,\nand Intelligence, Arthur L. Money, dated August 16, 2000, (Money Memorandum), a security\nclearance must be denied or revoked for an Applicant with a foreign passport \u201cunless the applicant\nsurrenders the foreign passport....\u201d Surrender of the passport contemplates returning it to the issuing\nauthority. There is no evidence that Applicant has accomplished this.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions, and especially  Foreign Preference Mitigating\nConditions (FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.1. (Dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth\nin a foreign country), and FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4 (individual has expressed a willingness to renounce\ndual citizenship) and conclude none apply.\nForeign Influence\n\nISCR Case No. 98-0419 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr 30, 1995).\n20\n7\nThe government has established its case under Guideline B. Applicant\u2019s father, and his\nparents-in-law are residents and citizens of Iran. However, the mere possession of family ties with\na person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under the Guideline. Such ties\nraise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal,\nextenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. Whether an\napplicant\u2019s family ties in a foreign country pose a susceptibility to foreign influence depends on a\ncommon sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of those family ties.  Foreign\n20\nInfluence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1(an immediate family member or person to\nwhom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen, or, a resident or present\nin, a foreign country), applies in this case.\nWhen the Government\u2019s initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case. Here Applicant lives and resides\nin the U. S., and his father and his parents-in-law stay with him in his home for period of time each\nyear. FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2. (Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their\ncitizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists) applies. \nApplicant acknowledged his father is retired from the Iranian government. FI DC.\nE2.A2.1.2.3 (relatives, co-habitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government)\napplies. Iran is a country that is clearly hostile to the U.S. It is considered the most active state\nsponsor of terrorism, and the government has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses\nagainst its people, Applicant\u2019s immediate family in Iran creates a heightened risk of foreign coercion\npressure, or exploitation.\nApplicant\u2019s last visit to Iran was recent (2001). Applicant\u2019s personal and family ties to his\nhomeland are not in dispute. His wife\u2019s family and his father are citizen residents and could be\nsubject to coercion or pressure by the government. \nAs discussed earlier, Applicant maintains close contact with his family and visits them in Iran\nor has them living in his home in the U.S. for a part of every year. Applicant bears the burden of\ndemonstrating that his family members are not in a position where they could be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force him to choose loyalty to those relatives and the U.S.\nApplicant has not met his burden to establish his relatives are not vulnerable to pressure or duress\nby a foreign power. The record is devoid of any information concerning their identity or whether they\nare in anyway connected to the government, military, or intelligence services. Foreign Mitigating\nCondition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 (A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse,\nfather, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associates(s) in questions are not\nagents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could\nforce the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States) does\nnot apply.\nThe record evidence supports the legal presumption that family ties are not casual in nature.\nApplicant admitted providing financial support to his father \u201cwhen possible,\u201d  and Applicant traveled\n\n8\nto see his family in 1992 and 2001. Moreover, one or more of his Iranian relatives live with him and\nhis wife 6-9 months of the year. This is evidence of non-casual and frequent ties with his Iranian\nrelatives.  FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. (contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and\ninfrequent) does not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nFinally, I considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and\nvulnerability in protecting our national interests. I am not persuaded by the evidence in this case that\nApplicant would not be vulnerable to pressure or duress from a foreign power. Although Applicant\nhas developed a stable life in the U.S., he has not met the heavy burden of persuasion to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns. Ordinarily, an applicant\u2019s foreign citizenship possesses little security significance\nif based solely on his birth in a foreign country. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this\ncase that although Applicant is proud of his U.S. citizenship, he is vulnerable due to his family in\nIran.  A detrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not required before the\nGovernment may deny access under Guideline B or C. Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns under Foreign Influence, and Foreign Preference in this case.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant co-signed a car loan for his son. His son missed a few\npayments. The car was repossessed, and a judgment was awarded against Applicant and his son.\nApplicant paid the judgment. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations concern.\nClearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nFORM see footnote 1.\n2\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On June 26, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 25, 2006, and\nelected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on November 7, 2006. A complete copy of the file of\nrelevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant received the FORM on December 28, 2007, and responded on January 18, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel replied to Applicant\u2019s response on July 16, 2007. The case was assigned to me\non July 26, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE\nDepartment Counsel submitted Item 4, Personal Subject Interview, Report of Investigation\n(ROI), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), conducted on November 4, 2004, as part of the\ndocumentary evidence to support the allegations in the SOR. This document is void of the\ninterviewer\u2019s name, signature, and any other type of authentication. Department Counsel contends\nItem 4 is admissible \u201cbecause Applicant chose to have an administrative determination without a\nhearing and by doing so alleviated the authentication requirement of Paragraph 20 of the Additional\nProcedural Guidance, pursuant to the Appeal Board caselaw.\u201d  In support of his position,\n2\nDepartment Counsel cites ISCR Case No. 95-0817 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). Specifically he notes\nin that case, the Appeal Board considered the \u201cCertified Results of Interview,\u201d which involved\nApplicant\u2019s admissions against interest made to an agent of the Defense Investigative Service and\notherwise admissible under Rule 803(6) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE). Department\nCounsel\u2019s reliance on this Appeal Board decision is misplaced. The Appeal Board decision\naddressed the admissibility of a Certified Results of Interview under Paragraph 22 of the Additional\nProcedural Guidance, not the authentication requirement for an ROI established by Paragraph 20 of\nthe Additional Procedural Guidance. Paragraph 22 specifically involves adverse statements made\nagainst applicants by third parties. That situation is not applicable in this case. Paragraph 20 states\nin part: \u201cOfficial records of evidence compiled in the regular course of business, other than DoD\npersonnel background reports of investigation (ROI), may be received and considered by the\nAdministrative Judge without authenticating witnesses.\u201d It elaborates \u201cAn ROI may be received with\nan authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel cites FRE 803(6) in support of his position. FRE 803(6), Hearsay Exceptions;\nAvailability of Declarant Immaterial, permits various types of documents to be admitted into\nevidence provided they were \u201cmade at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a\nperson with knowledge, if kept in the course of regularly conducted business activity, all as shown\n\nISCR Case No. 02-25196 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 10, 2007).  \n3\nItem 3.\n4\nId.; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n5\nItems 2-4; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n6\n4\nby the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with\nRule 902(11), Rule 902(12), or a statute permitting certification.\u201d  Item 4 is an unsworn \u201cPersonal\nSubject Interview\u201d conducted by an unknown person, that is not signed by the interviewer nor\ninterviewee, nor authenticated by an appropriate witness. It does not comply with FRE 902, which\nrequires the document to be certified by the custodian or other person authorized to make the\ncertification. Stated plainly, Item 4 is an ROI, not a Certified Results of Interview. If Item 4 was a\nCertified Results of Interview, signed and \u201cauthenticated\u201d by the agent who conducted the interview,\nit would be admissible.  The Government is misguided in its interpretation of Paragraphs 20 and 22\n3\nof the Additional Procedural Guidance, the Appeal Board case cited, and the FRE. Department\nCounsel has not offered any authoritative reference that states authentication of personal interview\nstatements is not required when the applicant elects not to have a hearing. The Government may\nrequest a hearing and circumvent the evidentiary issues raised here. They have chosen not to do so,\nand should not be permitted to use in a FORM what they could not in a hearing. Nonetheless,\nApplicant did not object to Item 4, possibly because he relied on Department Counsel\u2019s erroneous\nrecitation of the law, or because it contained information that was favorable to Applicant. Item 4 is\nadmitted as evidence in this case. I will consider those portions of the document that support\nApplicant\u2019s position in this case. The nature of the document will be considered when determining\nthe weight to be accorded the remaining information in Item 4.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant attended college\noverseas from 1965 to 1968. It is unclear what degree he holds, if any. He is married with at least\none child.4\nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1969 through 1972. He then served in the\nU.S. Army Reserve. Applicant was activated in September 1990, and served on active duty until\nJune 1991, in support of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He served in Kuwait as a member\nof Task Force Freedom. Applicant received the Army Commendation Medal and the Army\nAchievement Medal for his service.  \n5\nApplicant was activated in 2001 to 2002, in support of a homeland security mission. He was\nactivated again in February 2003, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He deployed to Iraq from\nApril 2003 to December 2003, as a Sergeant First Class in a military police company. Applicant was\nseparated from active duty in January 2004. Applicant has since retired from the Army Reserve.\nAmong other awards, Applicant received the Bronze Star Medal for his service.

His actions saved the lives of a family of\ninnocents, including 2 children and 2 pregnant women in their 3rd trimester.\u201d His Battalion\nCommander commented, \u201c[o]utstanding actions by one of the best soldiers in the battalion.\n[Applicant\u2019s] actions inspired his subordinates and saved numerous lives.\u201d8\nApplicant\u2019s military awards include the above mentioned Bronze Star Medal, Army\nCommendation Medal (5  award), Army Achievement Medal (4  award), Meritorious Unit\nth\nth\nCommendation, Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal\n(3  award), Vietnam Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal with three Bronze Service Stars,\nrd\nArmed Forces Reserve Medal, Noncommissioned Officer\u2019s Professional Development Ribbon with\nNumeral 3, Army Service Ribbon, Army Reserve Components Overseas Training Ribbon (3rd\naward), Kuwait Liberation Medal, Kuwait Liberation Medal (K), and Kuwait Liberation Medal\n(SA).9\nIn 1999, Applicant co-signed for a car loan for his son, with his son to make the payments\non the loan. In 2000 to 2001, Applicant\u2019s son experienced financial difficulties, and fell behind on\na few of the payments. Applicant was activated at the time in support of  homeland security. His son\nthought he made payment arrangements with the finance company, but the car was repossessed\nwithout notice from Applicant\u2019s garage. Applicant\u2019s son was unaware the car was repossessed. He\nbelieved it was stolen, and reported it to the police. A few months later, they received notice that the\ncar was sold at auction. In about 2003, Applicant\u2019s son received a letter from a collection agency,\ndemanding the full payment of the car loan, or be taken to court.10\nIn 2004, Applicant and his son were sued by the collection agency. In July 2005, a judgment\nwas awarded against Applicant and his son in the amount of $16,149, with costs, for a total judgment\nof $16,619.  \n11\nApplicant\u2019s son made payment arrangements with the creditor, and agreed to pay $100 to\n$200 per month until satisfied. Applicant provided proof of four payments made between August\n2005 and November 2005, totaling $600. With accrued interest, the debt rose to $17,294, as of\n\nItem 2; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n12\nItems 4, 6-7. While the CBR of June 15, 2006 (Item 6) still reports the tax lien, the CBR of May 13, 2004\n13\nclearly reports the lien as paid. Applicant\u2019s old debts were not alleged in the SOR, and are not considered for\ndisqualifying purposes, but may be considered when analyzing the \u201cwhole person,\u201d and the potential application of\nmitigating conditions.\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n14\nId. at 527.\n15\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n16\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The\ncheck cleared on October 10, 2006.12\nApplicant had several delinquent debts from a number of years ago that were all paid in 2004,\nor earlier. A federal tax lien was filed in October 1997, for $11,248. The tax resulted when Applicant\nchanged employment and withdrew an IRA, incurring a tax liability. Applicant thought the taxes\nwere withheld from the disbursement. The tax was paid in 1998. The other debts were incurred when\nApplicant was deployed. The credit bureau report (CBR) of June 15, 2006, lists the tax lien and the\namount owed for the judgment, but lists no other delinquent debts.13\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n14\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n15\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n16\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n17\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n18\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n19\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\n\n7\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the\nDirective.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), apply in this case. Applicant co-signed for his son\u2019s auto loan,\naccepting responsibility if his son did not maintain payments for this debt. The car was repossessed\nand a judgment was obtained against Applicant and his son.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (It\nwas an isolated incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nThe judgment was not paid until October 2006, so the behavior is recent and FC MC\nE2.A6.1.3.1 does not apply. There is only one debt listed in the SOR, but Applicant had several other\ndebts, which were all resolved by 2004. Since 2004, the judgment has to be considered an isolated\nincident. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 is partially applicable. \nApplicant co-signed for his son\u2019s car loan. While he was activated, it was repossessed\nbecause his son did not maintain the payments. Those are conditions that were largely beyond\nApplicant\u2019s control. Applicant did not address the problem himself until October 2006. Applicant\nmerits partial application of FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. \nThere is no evidence Applicant received counseling, so FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 is not applicable.\nApplicant paid the only debt listed in the SOR in October 2006. Applicant\u2019s old debts were resolved\nseveral years ago. He is now current on all his debts. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 is applicable.\n\n8\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered all the evidence, and every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nApplicant is a combat veteran, who served our country through three conflicts. The accolades\nby his superiors in Iraq are truly inspiring. The only listed concern in the SOR is a judgment incurred\nbecause Applicant co-signed a car loan for his son, and the car was repossessed while Applicant was\nactivated. The debt has been paid. This one paid debt does not make Applicant a security risk. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non his financial issues.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nEdward W. Loughran\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He had unprotected sensitive documents on his company computer, he talked\nabout automatic weapons, gave a friend a Viagra tablet, and never reduced to writing that his\napartment was searched by the police in 2001. The record evidence is sufficient to mitigate or\nextenuate the negative security implications stemming from the criminal conduct and personal\nconduct security concerns.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\n1\nclearance for Applicant.  The SOR set forth reasons security concerns due to criminal conduct and\npersonal conduct.\nOn March 3, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On August 28,\n2006, I was assigned the case. On September 18, 2006, a Notice of Hearing was issued for the\nhearing held on October 20, 2006.  On October 31, 2006, DOHA received a copy of the transcript\n(Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct.  Applicant\nadmits to the following: in February 2001, he was arrested for forgery.  In attempting to transfer\ndocuments to another he used the default setting, which inadvertently allowed other in his Windows\nWorkgroup access to the material. He was contacted by company security and corrected the\nproblem.  He had an email exchange about automatic weapons.  Applicant obtained a Viagra pill\nfrom a colleague and gave it to a friend who was curious about the pills effects. The admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 32-year-old materials engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since\nAugust 1998 and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant is regarded by those who know\nhim as a very trustworthy, loyal, honest, organized, efficient, and competent employee who has\nexcellent rapport with people. (App Ex A)  His most recent performance evaluation rates him as a\nhigh contributor willing to go the extra mile.  His previous evaluation rated him as a successful\ncontributor, a competent performer, and valued team player.  His next most recent evaluation listed\n\n3\nhim as a high contributor. (App Ex B)  In September 2006, his duty performance earned him a spot\ncash award. (App Ex C)\nIn 1997, Applicant graduated with two bachelor\u2019s of science degrees, one in chemistry and\nthe other in environmental science.  He is currently working on his Master\u2019s degree.  Since August\n1998, he has been employed with his current employer. \nIn February 2001, Applicant accompanied a group of friends to a bar.  Applicant paid for his\nbeer with a twenty-dollar bill. An acquaintance was also at the bar paying for his drink. His\nacquaintance continued at the bar talking to the bartender whom he knew from high school or from\nsome other activity. The acquaintance returned to the table and said the bartender had pointed out\nthe bill the acquaintance used to pay for his drink was a forged twenty dollar bill.  The acquaintance\nsaid he tore up the bill and threw it in the trash near the bar. The acquaintance did not reference the\nbill Applicant had used. After the bill was reported as fake, Applicant never saw the bill. Applicant\nand friends remained in the bar.  Two or three hours later, the police arrived at the bar and said there\nwere reports of forged twenty dollar bills being passed. \nApplicant was arrested on the charge of forging a government instrument and released on\na $1,500 bond.  Shortly after being released, he was questioned by the U.S. Secret Service.  In\nDecember 2001, approximately eight months later, the charges were dropped.  He never appeared\nin court or had any action taken against him related to this matter.  Applicant never knowingly\npassed a forged or fraudulent bill. (Tr. 30)\nIn August 2002, Applicant needed to share unclassified files with a coworker. He was not\nfamiliar with setting up share permissions on his computer.  He chose the default share permissions\nwhich unknown to him allowed everyone in his workgroup to see the sensitive information.\nApplicant received an email stating the problem and saying the files had been deleted. He was\ninformed to reset his share permissions. This was a one time event. Applicant no longer uses\nWindows Shares for that reason. The company removed the majority of employees\u2019 ability to\ncontrol this type of activity.  The company\u2019s current procedure is the systems administrator opens\nand shares out folders. (Tr. 33) Other than the email, Applicant received no punishment or loss of\npay over the incident.  It did not impact on his work performance evaluation. \nIn July 2003, the police were investigating an acquaintance of Applicant.  They were looking\nfor items this individual may have given Applicant. The police asked to search Applicant\u2019s\napartment and he granted permission for the search. A search of the acquaintance\u2019s apartment\ndisclosed a Viagra pill inside a bottle on which was written Applicant\u2019s name.  Applicant\u2019s friend\nhad heard the claims being made about Viagra and was curious.  Applicant had a coworker who had\na prescription for Viagra and obtained a pill from the coworker for his friend.  Applicant realizes\nit was wrong and an error in judgment to pass along the Viagra tablet. (Tr. 34) Applicant\noccasionally sees the person he gave the pill to because the person works out at the same gym as\nApplicant.  They no longer socialize and are no longer close friends.\nIn an email, Applicant and this same friend also discuss how cool it would be to have an\nautomatic weapon.  Applicant admits it was very poor judgment on his part to talk about obtaining\nautomatic weapons. (Tr. 34)  Applicant has not emailed this individual in years. (Tr. 50)\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n4\nIn September 2003, Applicant made a signed, sworn statement (Gov Ex 2) about the forged\nbill incident. The statement did not mention the July 2003 search of his apartment.  Applicant told\nthe Defense Security Service (DSS) special agent about the search and was told that since the party\nbeing investigated was not the Applicant but his friend further discussions about the search were not\nnecessary. The discussion about the search then ended and was not made part of the September\n2003-written statement.  In December 2003, Applicant made another signed, sworn statement (Gov\nEx 3) addressing the forged bill and other incidents which included the July 2003 search.  Applicant\ndid not withhold information about the search during the September 2003 interview. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate government's case. Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\n\n5\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline J, criminal conduct is of security concern because a history or pattern of\ncriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. A history\nof illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with\nregulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified information.\nIn February 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with forgery of a government\ninstrument, a felony.  The charge was later dropped. Because of this arrest DC 1 (E2.A10.1.2.1.\nAllegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged) and 2 (E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) apply. \nApplicant supposedly passed a fake twenty dollar bill.  After paying for his beer and being\ninformed by an acquaintance about a fake bill, Applicant and his acquaintances stayed at the bar for\nanother two to three hours before the police arrived.  It is most unlikely had Applicant knowingly\npassed a fake bill that he would have remained in the bar for another two or more hours.  A person\npassing fake currency is more apt to leave immediately after getting his change and finishing his\nbeer.  He is not likely to stick around for hours.  Applicant talked to the Secret Service and months\nlater the charge was dropped.  Applicant did not appear in court. \n I find no criminal conduct on the part of Applicant.  MC 4 (E2.A10.1.3.4. The person did\nnot voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur)\napplies.  Even if I did, the arrest occurred more than five and one half years before the hearing\nmaking this behavior not recent. MC 1 (E2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal behavior was not recent)\napplies.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.a. \nApplicant told the investigator his apartment had been searched looking for items that might\nhave been stored there for an acquaintance who was under investigation.  Applicant was not being\ninvestigated and was not charged with any crime.  When Applicant told this to the DSS special\nagent, he was told he did not have to talk about it because the investigation was unrelated to him.\nApplicant completed a sworn statement (Gov Ex 2) in which he stated he had no other adverse\ncontact with any law enforcement agency.  The statement followed the special agent\u2019s advice.  It\ndoes not constitute a false statement.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.b. and find for him as to\ncriminal conduct. \nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under guideline E, (Personal\nConduct).  Under Guideline E, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when\nthat applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the\nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. In August 2002, Applicant had unprotected\n\n6\nsensitive documents on his computer, he talked about automatic weapons with a friend, and passed\nalong a Viagra tablet to a friend. \nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a\nperson's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified\ninformation. In August 2002, Applicant needed to share sensitive documents with a coworker. Not\nbeing familiar with the share permissions, he used the default setting which was too broad and\nallowed access to other employees who he did not intend to have access.  It would be nice to know\nhow to do everything on a computer, but the average person\u2019s knowledge is not all encompassing.\nHe attempted to perform something he was unfamiliar with and made a mistake.  Applicant received\nan email stating there was a problem, informing him the information had been deleted, and directing\nhim to reset his share permissions, which he did.  This was a one time event. Not knowing how to\nset the permission status on one\u2019s work computer does not create doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability or trustworthiness.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 2.a. \nApplicant and a friend emailed each other about how great it would be to have an automatic\nweapon.  Applicant admits it was very poor judgment on his part to talk about obtaining automatic\nweapons. But that is all the emails amounted to was talk.  No actions were ever taken in order to\nsecure such a weapon.  Talking about guns, even about obtaining automatic weapons, is not so\negregious as to create doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability or trustworthiness.  I find for\nApplicant as to SOR 2.b. \nBack in July 2003, the claims of Viagra were new.  Applicant\u2019s friend wanted to check out\nthe claims and Applicant said he had a friend with a prescription and would get a tablet.  Applicant\ngave his friend a tablet, which was an inappropriate action.  Passing along prescription medicine to\nsomeone without a prescription is wrong.  Applicant realizes it was wrong and an error in judgment.\nThis occurred more than three years ago.  This was a bad thing to do but not so egregious as to\ncreate doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability or trustworthiness.  I find for Applicant as to SOR\n2.c. \nAs previously described, there was no deliberate failure to disclose the search, in fact\nApplicant did disclose the search to the DSS but it was not made part of the first statement.\nApplicant informed the DSS about the search, he was told he did not have to talk about it. In a\nsecond interview, he was asked more questions about the search and he answered the questions.\nApplicant's explanation as to why the search was not made part of the first sworn statement is\ncredible. No disqualifying conditions apply. Considering his appearance and demeanor while\ntestifying and the totality of information, his explanation is credible.  I find for Applicant as to SOR\n2.d. \nEach of the allegations concerning Applicant\u2019s misconduct has been addressed separately.\nLeast any reviewer attempt to say that they were addressed piecemeal, I have considered the\napplication of various mitigating factors in addition to the totality of Applicant's circumstances and\nthe record as a whole.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d factors have been considered, which include: the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the\ncircumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \n\n7\n Applicant was charged with passing a forged bill.  However, after paying for his drinks and\nbeing informed of the concern over a forged bill, Applicant and his associates continued to remain\nat the location where the money was passed for more than two hours. Passing forged bills is\ncertainly serious conduct, but considering the facts and circumstances surrounding the passing of\nthe bill, Applicant did not know the bill was fraudulent. He did not voluntarily pass a bogus bill.\nThe frequency and recency of this event was one time more than five and one half years ago.\nMaking a mistake as to the permissions on a Window folder does not involve questionable\njudgment, unwillingness to comply with rules, unreliability, dishonesty, or lack of candor.  The\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct of having unprotected sensitive documents on one\u2019s\ncomputer, the circumstances surrounding the conduct, Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable\nparticipation, the motivation for the conduct, the frequency and recency of the conduct, and the\nprobability that the circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future must be considered.\nApplicant voluntarily set the permissions but his knowledge as to how to do it was faulty.  He did\nnot intend the material to be accessible to anyone but the one person he thought he had given access.\nHis motivation was to provide that one person access.  It was simply a mistake which occurred once\nfour years ago and has not been repeated.  It is unlikely the conduct would recur since the company\nchanged its policy and now requires a systems manager to set the permissions \nIn reviewing the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors, the seriousness of passing along a Viagra pill has\nbeen considered. The facts and circumstances surround the event were a friend was curious about\nthe effects, Applicant knew someone who had a prescription, and got a pill for his then friend.\nViagra, although a prescription drug, is not a schedule II or III controlled drug. Applicant acted\nvoluntarily and was motived by a desire to allow his friend to experience the claims being made by\nthe drug manufacture. This was a one time occurrence occurring more than three years ago.  There\nis no probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d factors have been considered, related to Applicant\u2019s talking about guns\nand wouldn\u2019t it be great to have an automatic weapon. In considering the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct, this was all just talk. His talk does not show unreliability,\nuntrustworthiness, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules, \nThe Applicant revealed the search of his apartment and relied on the DSS special agent\u2019s\nstatement that it did not need to be part of the sworn statement.  This is neither a false statement nor\na deliberate failure to disclose.  His actions constituted neither criminal conduct nor adverse personal\nconduct. \nMy analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record are a reasonable interpretation\nof the record evidence as a whole. I have considered the significance of Applicant's pattern of\nconduct.  Taken together, the separate events alleged do not have a significance that is missing when\neach event is viewed in isolation.  In this case, there is no evidence of serious, repeated poor\njudgment, or rule violations. I have considered the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant and have not made a piecemeal analysis of Applicant\u2019s overall conduct. I find for\nApplicant as to criminal conduct and personal conduct. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3., Paragraph 7., of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Criminal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 Personal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \n1\nApplicant has raised the following assignments of error: whether the Judge erred in\nconcluding that Applicant deliberately falsified her security clearance application; whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse credibility determination is arbitrary and capricious; whether the Judge erred in\nfailing to apply Guideline E mitigating conditions; whether the Judge erred in failing to apply\nGuideline J mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis was the result of\nan arbitrary and capricious weighing of the evidence.

In 1979 she moved to the U.S. and decided to remain here after the Iranian Revolution\noccurred, given the fact that her fianc\u00e9 was Jewish.  Applicant became a U.S. citizen, married, and\nraised two children in this country.  \nApplicant has traveled to Iran three times since moving to the U.S., in 1994, 1996, and 2002.\nThe first two trips were to visit her elderly parents and/or grandmother, the third to visit the graves\nof her recently deceased parents.

Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\n\n3\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  Applicant does not\nchallenge the Judge\u2019s findings.  To the extent that such a challenge is implicit in Applicant\u2019s first\nassignment of error, we will address it below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nAs stated above, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that she deliberately\nprovided false statements as part of her clearance investigation through her denial of having\npossessed a foreign passport and her omission of her trips to Iran in 1996 and 2002.  Concerning the\nfirst, Applicant contended at the hearing that she held only an Iranian visa, not a passport.  However,\nthe Judge noted that the documents in question, admitted as exhibits, were clearly marked\n\u201cpassport;\u201d that in a written response to interrogatories Applicant stated that she traveled to Iran with\nIranian passports; and that in her response to the SOR Applicant described the documents in that way\nas well.  Decision at 3.  The Judge concluded, therefore, that Applicant could not reasonably have\nbelieved that the documents in question were merely entry visas and that Applicant\u2019s denials of\nhaving held Iranian passports constituted deliberate falsifications.  \nWe have examined the decision in light of the record evidence.  In addition to those matters\ndiscussed above, we note that Government Exhibit 9 contains a memorandum, apparently in\nApplicant\u2019s own hand, certifying that a reproduced document is an accurate copy of an Iranian\npassport, of which Applicant is the custodian. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s own Exhibit Z is a\nphotocopy of a document that is clearly marked \u201cpassport,\u201d issued to Applicant by the government\nof Iran, and which no reasonable person could mistake for a mere entry visa.  Applicant includes a\ntranslation of part of this document from Farsi into English, the translation describing it as a\n\n See, e.g., the following: \u201cShe . . . testified that after she mailed her expired Iranian passport back to the Iranian\n2\nauthorities, she received back from them the Iranian passport she had sent to them (with a hole punched into it to\ninvalidate it) . . . and an Iranian document . . .  She further testified that because the document was marked \u201cPassport,\u201d\nshe became confused and called the Iranian officials who assured her that the document she received was a visa, not a\npassport . . . [A]pplicant accepted their explanation that it was a visa and not a passport.\u201d  Decision at 2-3.  \nSee Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E2.A5.1.3.3, E2.A10.1.3.1, E2.A10.1.3.2.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cfalsifications of material facts are extremely troubling.  The Government relies heavily on the\n4\nhonesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation\u2019s secrets.  When such an individual intentionally falsifies\nmaterial facts on a security clearance application, or in a signed, sworn statement, it is extremely difficult to conclude\nthat he or she nevertheless possesses the good judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness required of clearance holders\n. . . In reaching a decision under Guidelines E and J, I have considered the formal adjudication guidelines as well as the\nDirective\u2019s general factors.  In the end, a decision under Guidelines E and J in this case boils down to this: Applicant\u2019s\n4\npassport.  Given the evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not honestly believe she\nheld only entry visas, and therefore deliberately falsified her responses concerning her foreign\npassports, is sustainable.  \nFor similar reasons the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant deliberately omitted listing her trips\nto Iran is sustainable.  Applicant submitted two SCAs, in October 2002 and again in March 2003.\nShe visited Iran in August 2002, to visit her parent\u2019s graves, an event so recent and of a nature so\nmemorable that the Judge concluded the omission could not have been due to mere forgetfulness.\nConsidered in light of the record, there is \u201ca rational connection\u201d between the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact and his conclusion that Applicant deliberately provided false information on this matter.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).   The Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the\ndeliberate quality of Applicant\u2019s falsifications is, therefore, neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary\nto law.\nRegarding the second assigned issue, Applicant bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d in challenging a\nJudge\u2019s credibility determination (See ISCR Case No. 97-0356 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 21, 1998)),\nwhich determination is entitled to deference on appeal.  Directive \u00b6  E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-\n26331 at 3, n. 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2005).  We conclude that Applicant has not met her burden of\npersuasion in this matter.  Although Applicant asserts that the Judge ignored record evidence that\nsupported her side of the story, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence, and there\nis nothing to indicate that he did otherwise in this particular case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).  Applicant points to certain of the Judge\u2019s statements,\ncontained in his findings of fact, which she argues undermine his negative assessment of Applicant\u2019s\ncredibility.   However, when read  in context, these statements are the Judge\u2019s attempts to summarize\n2\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, rather than exculpatory findings of his own.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 01-07018 at 9 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005) ( \u201cThe Board does not review individual sentences of a\nJudge\u2019s decision in isolation.\u201d)  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.      \nWe have considered the remaining assignments of error in light of the Judge\u2019s decision and\nthe record as a whole.  The Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s multiple falsifications\nwere recent and not isolated.   Given the evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had failed\n3\nin her burden of persuasion as to the applicability of any possible mitigating condition is sustainable.\nFurthermore, the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.1, in that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.  \n4\n\ninability or unwillingness to admit that she attempted to conceal her possession of an active Iranian passport and her\ntravel to Iran from the Government precludes a finding that she can now be relied upon to be truthful with the\nGovernment.\u201d  Decision at 6.\n5\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  The Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision\nis neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nThomas M. Abbott, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant did not respond truthfully to questions on two Security Clearance Applications.\nShe also made false, material misrepresentations in a signed, sworn statement she gave to the\nDefense Security Service (DSS). Clearance is denied.\n\n Now that her parents have passed away, and she has visited their grave sites, applicant\n1\nhas neither the need nor the desire to make any further trips to Iran. During this last trip, she\nsigned over any rights she may have had in her parents\u2019 property to her brother.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 18, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, (as administratively reissued on April 20,1999), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\napplicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine\nwhether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 24, 2006. The case was assigned to the\nundersigned on August 4, 2006. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 11, 2007, and the\nhearing was held on January 18, 2007. The transcript was received on January 29, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 51 years of age. She has been employed by the same defense contractor since\n1988.\nApplicant was born and raised in Iran. In 1979, she left Iran and moved to the United States\nto join her fianc\u00e9 who was teaching at a university. They intended to return to Iran to get married,\nbut their plans changed when the Iranian Revolution occurred. Because her fianc\u00e9 was Jewish, they\ndecided it was in their best interests to remain in the United States. They were married in the United\nStates in1979.  She became a United States citizen, and obtained a United States passport, in 1985.\nThey had two children. The children, United States citizens by birth, are now adults and live in the\nUnited States. Applicant and her husband divorced in 1997. Her former husband, a naturalized\nUnited States citizen, resides in the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s parents passed away in 2002. She has two siblings. Her older brother is a citizen\nand resident of the United States. Her other brother, who is about 16 years her junior, is a citizen and\nresident of Iran. He is married and has one child. Because of their age difference, applicant never had\na close relationship with this brother. They communicate by telephone a few times a year. Applicant\nhas no assets in Iran. She has substantial assets in the United States. Since moving to the United\nStates, applicant has intended to make the United States her permanent home.\nApplicant has traveled to Iran three times since moving to the United States. These three trips\ntook place in 1994, 1996, and August 2002. The first two trips were to visit her elderly parents\nand/or grandmother. The third trip was to visit the grave sites of her parents.  Applicant testified that\n1\nprior to her first trip, she contacted Iranian authorities working out of a third country\u2019s embassy, and\n\nIn a signed, sworn statement she gave to the DSS in June 2003, she stated she did not\n2\ndisclose her 1996 trip to Iran on \u201cthe security form\u201d because she thought it \u201chad occurred after\nthe seven year time limit\u201d (Exhibit 10).\n3\nexplained to them that she was a United States citizen who needed an Iranian visa to visit Iran. She\nfurther testified that after she mailed her expired Iranian passport back to the Iranian authorities, she\nreceived back from them the Iranian passport she had sent to them (with a hole punched into it to\ninvalidate it) (Exhibit Y) and an Iranian document (Exhibit AA). She further testified that because\nthe document was marked \u201cPassport,\u201dshe became confused and called the Iranian officials who\nassured her that the document she received was a visa, not a passport (TR at 32, 35-36). Because by\nthe terms of the document she could not stay longer than four months in Iran, applicant accepted\ntheir explanation that it was a visa and not a passport. Applicant used a similar document to travel\nto Iran in 1996 and 2002. As will be explained more fully below, the documents were passports, not\nvisas, and applicant\u2019s testimony that she did not think they were passports was not credible. In\nJanuary 2007, applicant mailed the documents back to the Iranian interest section of a third country\u2019s\nembassy along with a cover letter renouncing any Iranian citizenship that Iran \u201cmay view her to\npossess\u201d(Exhibit X).\nApplicant completed an SCA that she caused to be electronically submitted on or about\nOctober 9, 2002. (Exhibit 19). On said SCA, applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to the following question:\n\u201c15. In the last 7 years, have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign government?\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s response was false because, as noted above, at the time she executed the SCA, she had\nbeen in possession of an active Iranian passport during the previous seven years. Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation that she responded \u201cno\u201d because she believed she had been issued and had used Iranian\nvisas, not Iranian passports, offered for the first time at the hearing, was not credible for at least three\nreasons: First, the documents are clearly labeled \u201cpassport.\u201d Second, in her interrogatory answers of\nMarch 2006 (Exhibit 3), she clearly stated she traveled to Iran on Iranian passports, and added that\nshe \u201cwill be happy to dispose of the Iranian passports in any way requested by your office.\u201d Third,\nin her response to the SOR, applicant admitted that the Iranian Consulate had issued her passports.\nSpecifically, in pertinent part she stated: \u201cI admit that I applied for a visa to travel to Iran [in 1994,\n1996 and 2002]. The Iranian consulate issued me a passport, since I was born there, even though I\nhad informed them that I am seeking a Visa with my American passport.\u201d I find that applicant\nintentionally provided the false information on the SCA.\nOn the same SCA, applicant intentionally falsified material facts when she failed to disclose\nher 1996 and August 2002 trips to Iran in response to the following question: \u201c16. Have you traveled\noutside the United States on other than official U.S. Government orders in the last 7 years?\u201d\nApplicant denies any intent to conceal these trips from the Government. At the hearing she offered\nthe following explanation: In May or June 2002, she was asked to complete an SCA. While going\nthrough the SCA, she came to Question 16 and disclosed her trips to other countries in 2000 because\nthis information was fresh in her mind. However, because she was uncertain about the dates she\ntraveled to Iran, she left the question with the intention of researching the dates of her Iranian trips\nand then returning to the question. She never got around to it and must have made an honest mistake\nand forgot about it because she ended up signing the SCA in July 2002 without disclosing any travel\nto Iran.  This first SCA was rejected by DoD and returned to applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s security\n2\ndepartment in September 2002 (Exhibit K). In October 2002, applicant was informed that she had\nto resubmit her SCA. She asked the security department how this new SCA differed from the SCA\n\nResponse to SOR.\n3\n4\nshe completed earlier that year and was told all she had to do was sign it again. So she did, without\nremembering she had not revisited Question 16, and without remembering that she had just visited\nIran two months earlier. Applicant\u2019s denial of an intent to deceive was not credible.\nApplicant intentionally falsified material facts on a second SCA that she executed on March\n17, 2003 when she again denied having an active foreign passport issued within the last seven years\nand again failed to disclose her 2002 trip to Iran. Applicant denies any attempt to deceive. She\ntestified that in late 2002 she was informed she had to complete a new SCA because her clearance\nwas being upgraded. She asked if this new SCA was different from the SCA she recently completed\nand was told \u201conly if you have got married or you have had a child or there has been a death in the\nfamily.\u201d Since these events had not occurred, she figured her old SCA was good so she went to the\nsecurity office and just signed the form containing the same information from October 2002. She\nhad completely forgotten about the Iranian travel in August 2002 (TR at 57). Applicant\u2019s denial of\nan intent to conceal her travel to Iran, and her possession of an active Iranian passport, was not\ncredible.\nAs noted above, applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to the DSS in June 2003. In\nit, she made the following statement:  \u201cI had a three year Iranian passport when I first came to the\nUS which has since expired and my current US passport has expired. I obtained my 1978 expired\nIranian passport prior to becoming a US citizen in 1985. My US passport (which just expired on\n14 Apr 03) is the only document I have used and intend to use for all travel outside the US. I plan\non renewing my US passport in the future.\u201d This statement was false and misleading in two material\nrespects. First, applicant\u2019s original three year Iranian passport may have expired; however, she\nrenewed it and possessed an active Iranian passport during her three trips to Iran in 1994, 1996 and\n2002. Second, even if she used her United States passport on her trips to Iran as she claims, by her\nown admission, she used another document in conjunction with the United States passport to enter\nand exit Iran; namely, the Iranian supplied document.3\nApplicant testified that she informed her employer\u2019s security department each time she\ntraveled to Iran. Although no documentation from her employer corroborates this testimony,\napplicant did offer affidavits from two coworkers. The first coworker states that he worked with\napplicant from 1988 to 1998, and although he cannot recall the dates, he remembers applicant\nopenly discussing her trips to Iran during that time (Exhibit W). The second coworker states he was\napplicant\u2019s supervisor from 2001-2003, and he recalls applicant advising him of a trip to Iran\n(Exhibit E).\nDeclarations from a number of applicant\u2019s coworkers, including former and current\nsupervisors, and friends, were admitted into evidence (Exhibits A-F, V, W, BB). These letters\nestablish that these individuals view applicant as an excellent employee, a trustworthy individual,\nand a loyal American. There is no evidence that any of these individuals were aware of the extent\nof applicant\u2019s falsifications when they prepared these affidavits.\n\nDirective, Sections E2.2.1.1. through E2.2.1.9.\n4\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and\nresident of Iran. This fact requires application of Disqualifying Condition E2.A2.1.2.1 (an\nimmediate family member . . . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country).\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has precluded application of Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.1\n(a determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in question are not agents of a foreign\npower or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual\nto choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States) in cases where an\nimmediate family member of an applicant still resides in a country like Iran. Therefore, this\nmitigating condition is not applicable.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held, however, that a \u201cJudge is not limited to Adjudicative\nGuidelines mitigating conditions when deciding whether an applicant has demonstrated extenuation\nor mitigation,\u201d but may consider \u201cthe totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances\u201d under\n\u201cthe Directive\u2019s general factors.\u201d ISCR Case No.03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. April 17, 2006).\nApplicant came to this country over 25 years ago. Since moving to the United States, her\nconduct has been consistent with her stated intention of making the United States her permanent\nhome. She married here; became a United States citizen; had two children in the United States, and\ndid not seek Iranian citizenship for them; purchased a home; acquired numerous real estate and\nother assets in the United States; and voted in United States elections. On the other hand, she has\nno assets in Iran, and even gave up any right she may have had to any of her parents\u2019 property in\nIran after they died. In addition, although her contacts with her brother in Iran cannot be considered\n\u201ccasual and infrequent,\u201d the two of them have never been particularly close give the difference in\ntheir ages. Even though the foreign country at issue is one of the worst human rights abusers,\nconsidering the totality of applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances under the Directive\u2019s general\nfactors,  I conclude that applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is such that even if she were forced\n4\nto choose between loyalty to her brother and loyalty to the United States, she would undoubtedly\nchoose her loyalty to the United States, and would report any attempt to pressure her to the proper\nauthorities.  Accordingly, I further conclude that she has met her burden and demonstrated sufficient\nmitigating and extenuating evidence to overcome the foreign citizenship and residence of her\nbrother. Accordingly, Guideline B is found for applicant.\n \nWith respect to Guideline C, the evidence establishes that after she became a United States\ncitizen in 1985, applicant renewed and used her Iranian passport. This fact requires application of\nDisqualifying Conditions E2.A3.1.2.1 (the exercise of dual citizenship), and E2.A3.1.2.2\n(possession and/or use of a foreign passport).\nIn mitigation, applicant\u2019s Iranian citizenship is based solely on her birth in that country, she\nhas renounced it, and she has surrendered her Iranian passport. Accordingly, she qualifies for\nMitigating Conditions E2.A3.1.3.1 (dual citizenship is based solely on birth in a foreign country),\nand E2.A3.1.3.4 (individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship). In addition,\n\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications are felonies under 18 U.S.C. 1001.\n5\n6\nalthough a renewal of a foreign passport after obtaining United States citizenship is always a\nsecurity concern, I am convinced that applicant\u2019s sole reason for doing so was to be able to visit her\nelderly parents - and nothing more. Based on these facts, the fact that she has no reason or desire\nto travel to Iran in the future, and the fact that, viewing the evidence as a whole, she has shown a\nclear preference for the United States over Iran since arriving in the United States in1979, Guideline\nC is found for applicant.\nWith respect to Guidelines E and J, the Government has alleged and proven that applicant\nintentionally provided false material information in response to two questions on two different\nSCAs and in a signed, sworn statement she gave to DSS. These falsifications of material facts are\nextremely troubling. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals\nseeking access to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts\non a security clearance application, or in a signed, sworn statement, it is extremely difficult to\nconclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness\nrequired of clearance holders. Applicant\u2019s intentional falsifications require application of\nDisqualifying Conditions  E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire  . . .) and E2.A5.1.2.3\n(deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters\nto an investigator . . . ) under Guideline E, and Disqualifying Condition E2.A10.1.2.2 (a single\nserious crime or multiple lessor offenses) under Guideline J.  No Mitigating Conditions apply.\n5\nIn reaching a decision under Guidelines E and J, I have considered the formal adjudication\nguidelines as well as the Directive\u2019s general factors. In the end, a decision under Guidelines E and\nJ in this case boils down to this: Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to admit that she attempted\nto conceal her possession of an active Iranian passport and her travel to Iran from the Government\nprecludes a finding that she can now be relied upon to be truthful with the Government.\nAccordingly, Guidelines E and J are found against applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nGUIDELINE B: FOR THE APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE C: FOR THE APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE J:  AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\n\n7\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

SOR Allegation 1a: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of $2,509.00 as a result of a judgment entered against him in September 2003 (Exhibit 13). In a March 2004 signed, sworn statement he gave to the Defense Security Service (DSS) (Exhibit 7), applicant stated that within sixty days he will attempt to contact the creditor and verify the debt, and if it is a \u201cjust debt\u201d of his, he will make payment arrangements to satisfy it. Applicant has made no payments to this creditor. SOR Allegation 1b: This allegation, that applicant is indebted to \u201can undisclosed medical service provider,\u201d is found for applicant.

The case was assigned to me on April 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 32 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nSOR Allegation 1a: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$2,509.00 as a result of a judgment entered against him in September 2003 (Exhibit 13).  In a March\n2004 signed, sworn statement he gave to the Defense Security Service (DSS) (Exhibit 7), applicant\nstated that within sixty days he will attempt to contact the creditor and verify the debt, and if it is a\n\u201cjust debt\u201d of his, he will make payment arrangements to satisfy it. Applicant has made no payments\nto this creditor.\nSOR Allegation 1b: This allegation, that applicant is indebted to \u201can undisclosed medical\nservice provider,\u201d is found for applicant.\nSOR Allegation 1c:  In a December 2003 signed, sworn statement he gave to the DSS\n(Exhibit 6), applicant stated he did not know what the Mid Atlantic EM debt was, but since it is only\n$113.00, he will contact them and satisfy the account after the holidays.  In his response to the SOR,\nhe stated that \u201cthis was a doctor bill for one of my children, and I have paid this debt and I am no\nlonger in debt to this place.\u201d Since this debt is not listed on applicant\u2019s most current credit report,\nI find that applicant is no longer indebted to this creditor.\nSOR Allegation 1d: In his December 2003 statement to DSS, applicant stated that he had\nspoken to his wife about this debt and she informed him that \u201cthis is a card that she had gotten, and\n\n Applicant submitted some of his wife\u2019s bankruptcy paperwork in response to the SOR.\n1\nAlthough it appears this debt was included in his wife\u2019s bankruptcy petition, it cannot be\ndetermined from the paperwork what occurred in the bankruptcy court after the petition was\nfiled. The fact this debt was listed in his wife\u2019s bankruptcy petition, standing alone, does not\nprove applicant is no longer indebted to this creditor. \n There are two SCAs in the FORM, neither of which was executed by applicant on\n2\nSeptember 9, 2003. However, since it is clear that these two SCAs formed the basis for these four\n3\nfailed to pay.\u201d He then stated, \u201cshe tells me that she is going to resolve the account but if she does\nnot then I will have to make arrangements to satisfy the account.\u201d In his response to the SOR, he\ndenied he is indebted to First Premier Bank. He stated that this was a credit card that his wife applied\nfor in his name without his knowledge and she never paid the bill. He further stated that his wife had\nfiled a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and the debt was included in her bankruptcy. Based on the evidence\npresented, I find that applicant is still indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$544.00.1\nSOR Allegation 1e: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$8,779.00 as a result of the 2003 involuntary repossession of a vehicle he owned. In his response to\nthe SOR, applicant denied he is indebted to this creditor because the creditor was listed in his wife\u2019s\nbankruptcy. As noted earlier, the fact a debt was listed in his wife\u2019s bankruptcy petition, standing\nalone, does not prove appellant is no longer indebted to the creditor.\nSOR Allegation 1f: Applicant is indebted to the Department of Education in the approximate\namount of $7,944.00 for student loans on which he defaulted. An order to garnish his wages to\nsatisfy this debt was issued in July 2003. His wages are still being garnished by the creditor.\nSOR Allegation 1g: This is the same debt as the debt alleged in SOR paragraph 1a.\nSOR Allegation 1h: This judgment debt in favor of Sears from 1998 was satisfied by\napplicant in 2000.\nWith respect to applicant\u2019s current financial status, he began his response to the SOR  with\nthe following statement:\nI admit that I do have some overdue expenses, but I do not feel that I am financially\noverextended. I am the father of six kids and sometimes circumstances arise where\nI cannot pay something on time or pay off something as I previously planned, but I\nhave never engaged in any illegal acts to gain funds, and I will not do any such acts.\nI do the best that I can to work and pay what I can when I can.\nSOR Allegations 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d:. The Government alleges that on a Security Clearance\nApplication (SCA) he executed on September 9, 2003,  applicant lied about his financial history in\n2\n\nallegations, I considered them in reaching my decision. \nApplicant does not qualify for any Mitigating Conditions.\n3\n4\nresponse to four questions (Questions 35, 37, 38, and 39). Applicant denies he ever attempted to\ndeceive the Government. He insists that any incorrect information he provided was due to his\nignorance of the facts or his ignorance concerning how to properly complete the SCA. I have\ncarefully reviewed the SCA and applicant\u2019s explanations, and I conclude he did not intentionally\nfalsify the SCA. The fact that he disclosed two wage garnishments in response to Question 34, and\na $2,500.00 debt that was delinquent for more than 3 years in response to Question 38, put the\nGovernment on notice that he had severe financial problems, and is inconsistent with an attempt to\nmislead the Government about his finances.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant is still indebted to numerous creditors listed in the\nSOR in a total amount in excess of $10,000.00. The evidence further establishes that these debts\nhave been past-due for years, and that applicant has taken no voluntary action to address them.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations reflects adversely on his judgment and\nreliability, and suggests he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information. With respect\nto the Financial Considerations guideline, Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) and E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) are\napplicable.\nOnce the Government established a prima facie case under Guideline F, the burden shifted\nto applicant to show he has reformed. Applicant failed to meet his burden. Although he offered proof\nthat he satisfied the Sears debt, he offered no credible evidence that he (1) is willing to significantly\nreduce the remainder of his past-due indebtedness anytime soon, (2) has the ability to significantly\nreduce the remainder of his past-due indebtedness anytime soon, and (3) is unlikely to experience\nadditional financial difficulties. In fact, in his response to the SOR, he essentially admitted that he\nstill has trouble paying all of his bills on time. These facts establish that applicant is financially\noverextended. As such, his situation fits squarely within the Financial Guideline Concern expressed\nin the Directive (E2.A6.1.1.1 - An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.) Based on the foregoing, I have no choice but to conclude\nit is not now clearly consistent with the national interest for applicant to have access to classified\ninformation.3\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 2: FOR THE APPLICANT\n\n5\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He negotiated an\nagreement with another creditor in 2007 to pay an additional large debt.  The only unresolved debts\nare small, dated medical debts as his payment checks were returned as the collection agency was no\nlonger in business.

He is highly regarded as trustworthy and recommended for a security clearance by\nhis employer.  Consequently, concerns over financial issues can be mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on April 13, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not make\nthe preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleges specific concerns over finances\n1\n(Guideline F).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on April 28,\n2006, where he admitted in part and denied in part the allegations; he requested a decision without\na hearing.  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was forwarded on June 19, 2006; in his response\nof August 26, 2006, Applicant submitted documentation on his efforts to resolve his debts, but at that\npoint requested a hearing on his case.  The Administrative Judge assigned to the FORM forwarded\nthe file to the Chief Administrative Judge on October 10, 2006: the Memorandum noted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a hearing and that the Department Counsel had no objection.\nSubsequently, the case was assigned to me for hearing on January 17, 2007.  On January 17,\n2007,  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing and set this case to be heard on February 7, 2007, in a city\nnear where Applicant works.  Department Counsel presented eight exhibits (Exhibits 1-8) which\nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered eight exhibits\n(Exhibits A-H), which were admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant was given ten days\nto submit additional evidence before the close of business on February 17; the Government was\ngiven three days until February 20, 2007, to review the documents and submit a response.  (TR 66-\n67) On February 15, 2007, Applicant submitted Exhibit I, a two page document; Department\nCounsel did not object to Exhibit I, but argued in a letter of February 26, 2007, that the Government\ndid not have the responsibility to call an employer to seek a letter of reference as Applicant had\nrequested.   Subsequently, on February 23, 2007, Applicant submitted Exhibit J which detailed his\npayment arrangements with a major creditor.   On March 13, 2007, Applicant submitted five letters\nof reference (Exhibit K); on March 16, 2007, Department Counsel indicated he had no objection to\nthe admissibility of these exhibits.  Consequently, the Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits were\nadmitted; and the record closed on March 16, 2007.  The transcript (TR) was received on February\n15, 2007.\n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant, 47 years old, has been employed by successor defense contractors in State #1 as\na locksmith since July 2006 on a military base; he worked for another contractor from October 2000\nto July 2006.  The contract is rebid every five years.  He completed a Security Clearance Application\n(SF 86) on February 2001. Previously, he worked as a locksmith for other companies from 1994 to\n2000 and from 1984 to 1994.  (Exhibit 1; TR 26; 27-34)\nApplicant has not served in the military.  Applicant  has one child from an earlier relationship\nwho is 30.  He  married in June 1984 and also has three stepchildren, ages 25-28, who live\nindependently. (Exhibit 1; TR 26; 27-31; 34-35)\nFinances\nInvestigation disclosed several adverse credit issues in credit reports.  (Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n In May 2002 he was interviewed by a Defense Security Service Special Agent about his financial\ndifficulties.  He explained that the majority of debts were due to medical expenses that were not\ncovered by insurance.  He stated he would make arrangements to pay these debts, but he was also\npaying other debts.  (Exhibit 7)  Until he was shown his credit report in that interview he was\nunaware of the extent of his delinquencies.  (TR 30-34)  At one point Applicant\u2019s son lived with\nthem and used his father\u2019s information to take out some loans in the 1999 to 2001 period which\nApplicant took responsibility for paying.  This son is now incarcerated.  (TR 29) At the hearing\nApplicant provided documentation of other bills he has paid.  (Exhibits F, G, H)\nSOR 1.a.., 1.c.\nApplicant admitted a debt to Creditor #1, for a credit card for $412 which\nwas opened in 1998 and  was charged off in May 1999. The card was referred\nto Creditor #3, a collection agency, with a current debt of $839.  To address\nhis credit issues he made arrangements with Credit Solutions to consolidate\nhis debts; he is paying them a monthly payment of $115 to resolve this debt\nand other debts over a five or six year period.  He began making payments in\nJune 2006.   (Answer; Exhibit D; TR 35-38) [The Government conceded that\nSOR 1.a. and 1.c. are the same debt.  (TR 63)]\nSOR 1.b.\nApplicant denied a debt to Creditor #2, for $195 for a delinquent debt which\nwas charged off in August 1999.   (Answer; Exhibits 5, 6; Exhibit A; TR 38-\n39)\nSOR 1.d. \nApplicant denied a debt to Creditor #4, for a credit card for $184; he has no\nrecord of this debt.  (Answer; Exhibits 5, 6; Exhibit A; TR 39-40)\nSOR 1.e. \nApplicant admitted a debt to Creditor #5, for $175 for a medical debt to a\nhospital.  He mailed them a check and the check got \u201ckicked back.\u201d and not\n\n4\ndelivered to the collection agency; he called the number to get a better\naddress but there was no answer.  The hospital had no record as it had been\nsent to collection. (Answer; Exhibit H; TR 40-45)\nSOR 1.f. \nApplicant admitted a debt to Creditor #6, a collection agency for a credit card\nfor $2,832 from 2001. He made arrangements with Credit Solutions to\nconsolidate his debts: he is paying them a monthly payment of $115 to\nresolve this debt and other debts over a five or six year period.  He began\nmaking payments in June 2006.    (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5; Exhibit D; TR\n45)\nSOR 1.g. \nApplicant admitted his debt to a department store, Creditor #7, for $2,296,\ncharged off as a bad debt in 2001.  He made arrangements with Credit\nSolutions to consolidate his debts; he is paying them a monthly payment of\n$115 to resolve this debt and other debts over a five or six year period.  He\nbegan making payments in June 2006.   (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5; Exhibit\nD; TR 45-46)\nSOR 1.h. \nApplicant admitted a debt to Creditor #8, for $168 for a medical debt to a\ndoctor.  He mailed them a check and the check got \u201ckicked back.\u201d and not\ndelivered to the collection agency; he called the number to get a better\naddress but there was no answer.  The doctor had no record as it had been\nsent to collection. (Answer; Exhibit H; TR 40-45)\nSOR 1.i., 1.j.\nApplicant admitted a debt to Creditor #9, for $195 and Creditor #9 for $108,\nfor medical debts to a hospital.  He mailed them a check and the check got\n\u201ckicked back.\u201d and not delivered to the collection agency; he called the\nnumber to get a better address but there was no answer.  The hospital had no\nrecord of the debt as it had been sent to collection. (Answer; Exhibit H; TR\n47-48)\nSOR 1.k.\n.\nApplicant admitted a debt to Creditor #10, for $25 for a medical debt placed\nfor collection in 2002, but later stated he could not identify this creditor.\n(Answer; TR 48-49)\nSOR 1.l. \nApplicant denied a debt to Creditor #11 as he has paid his debt to that\ncreditor for $3,055 for a loan which was confirmed by his credit report. \nHowever, the government asserted the debt was still reflected as owing on a\nNovember 2005 credit bureau report.  (Answer; Exhibit 6; Exhibits A, B; TR\n49, 65)\nSOR 1.m. \nApplicant admitted a debt to Creditor #11 for a debt of $2,735, but believed\nhe had paid that debt.  (Answer; Exhibit 6; Exhibits A, B; TR 49, 65) After\nthe hearing he completed payment arrangements with Creditor #11 to make\na $200 payment ever month beginning on February 28, 2007, to resolve this\ndebt.  (Exhibit J)\n\n5\nSOR 1.n.\nWhile Applicant admitted a medical debt to Creditor #12 for $163 placed for\ncollection in 2003, he later claimed he had never used this doctor.  Applicant\nstated  he sent a check to a collection agency that was returned ; he could not\nfind the correct address for the collection agency.   (Answer; Exhibit H; TR\n52-53)\nSOR 1.o., 1.p.\nApplicant has paid a $70 debt and a $139 debt to a medical facility in August\n2006.  (Answer, Exhibit H; TR 53)\nIn 2007 Applicant reported he was making $19.60 per hour and works a 40-hour week.  (TR\n26-27) Applicant reported he earns approximately $2,000 net per month and his wife\u2019s net is $900\nper month working for a school district .  (TR 34, 54-55;  Exhibits 7, 8)  His monthly expenses\ninclude rent $250, groceries $300, utilities $400, and car expenses $336; his medical expenses are\nabout $175, and miscellaneous $100.  He has paid off all his car loans and has the debt payment plan\nof  $115.  He has a 1994 and 1998 auto and a 1980 truck.  He also has a retirement savings plan.  He\nhas no personal credit cards.  Beyond his arrangements with Credit Solutions, he has had no\nadditional credit counseling. He has approximately $1,000 remainder every month, so he is living\nprudently and within his means, so he is able to resolve his debts.  (Exhibits A,  D,  E; TR 58-61)\nReferences\nApplicant\u2019s program manger verified that he had worked for the company since July 2006\nas a locksmith.  The union representative reviewed Applicant\u2019s file and stated that he has never had\nany disciplinary action at the base.  He has been a member of the union since July 2004 and is in\ngood standing.  The director of human resources reported to the union that Applicant has been \u201can\nexemplary employee\u201d during his tenure;  she considers him \u201can important member of the team.\u201d  The\nhuman resources administrator in a June 2006 letter stated that he has been \u201ca valued asset\u201d and that\nhis \u201cintegrity and work ethics are exceptional.\u201d  She recommended him for a security clearance.\nAnother employee stated that during the seven years he had know Applicant, he has proven a reliable\nand dedicated employee with a skill level that is admirable.  Applicant is viewed as dependable and\ntrustworthy.  (Exhibit K)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual\u2019s security eligibility.  The mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy\ncondition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this\ncase, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Concern:  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\n\n       Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: E2.A6.1.2.1.  A\n2\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; E2.A6.1.2.2.  Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as\nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan\nstatements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; E2.A6.1.2.4.  Unexplained affluence; E2.A6.1.2.5.  Financial problems that are linked to gambling,\ndrug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.\n       Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: E2.A6.1.3.1.  The behavior was not recent;\n3\nE2.A6.1.3.2.  It was an isolated incident;  E2.A6.1.3.3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation);  E2.A6.1.3.4.  The person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol;  E2.A6.1.3.5.  The affluence resulted from a legal source; and E2.A6.1.3.6.  The individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n6\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Government established disqualifying conditions  that could raise a security concern and\n2\nmay be disqualifying including Applicant\u2019s  (1) history of financial problems and his (3) inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy all of his debts.  At the time of the investigation he had several\nunresolved debts that stemmed for medical bills when he was not insured and other consumer debts\nas well as debts created by his son for which he took responsibility. \nAlthough the dated delinquent debts have persisted, I conclude that under MC1, the behavior\nthat led to his debts was not recent as he developed no new delinquent debts.  Under MC 2, the debts\nare not isolated as in the past he developed multiple delinquent debts.  To his credit, Applicant has\nbeen making a systematic effort to resolve these debts where he has been able to reach the creditor\nor identify the debt collector.  Thus, Applicant falls within several mitigating  conditions.  First, he\n3\nhas developed a plan: he provided evidence he has addressed a majority of the debts by either paying\nthem in full or setting up a credit plan except for several smaller, dated debts where he sent a\npayment; but the collection agency was no longer in business and the checks were returned.  \nHis take home pay is approximately $2,000 per month and his wife\u2019s take home pay is $900\nper month, so they have disposable income of approximately $1,000 to resolve these debts as he lives\nprudently and has no car payments.  While under MC. 4., Applicant has not sought formal financial\ncounseling for the problem, he did see assistance and advice from Credit Solutions and is resolving\nseveral debts with them.  Now there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\n\n       See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n4\n7\nunder control as he took responsibility for resolving several debts through Credit Solutions and\nnegotiated directly with another creditor for payments to resolve that debt.  Under MC 6., an\nindividual is expected to have initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.  To mitigate Applicant does not have to have erased every debt.  Here Applicant has\ndemonstrated overall he is now financially responsible as he is consistently following  through on\nhis plan to resolve these debts. Thus, Applicant has mitigated these financial concerns as he has\nprovided evidence that he has a systematic plan to resolve the identifiable debts.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix\n8.  While Applicant\u2019s debt problems resulted in part from voluntary decisions to purchase items and\nfrom health care debts when he was not covered by insurance, Applicant provided evidence of\nrehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline\nand the complete absence of new delinquent, unpaid debt. The potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant has no mortgage payments as he rents, and has refrained\nfrom using any personal credit cards.  Greater awareness of financial responsibilities will result in\na continuously improving trend of financial circumstances. Moreover, he has stability in his\nemployment which should increase his net worth and establish a financial foundation for his future.\nIn sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low. He has had a clearance for a number of\nyears in his work for defense contractors.  At his place of employment, he is viewed as a responsible\nperson overall who is recommended for a security clearance by the director of human resources.  She\nstated that Applicant has been \u201can exemplary employee\u201d during his tenure; she considers him \u201can\nimportant member of the team.\u201d  He now has sufficient resources to resolve these delinquent debts\nand has been following a plan to do so since 2006.\nIn ISCR Case No. 04-07360 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006), the Board noted that two SOR debts\nwere paid through judgment and garnishment, one SOR debt was paid through settlement, and one\nSOR debt was never paid.  Indeed, for one SOR debt the applicant did not even contact the creditor\nabout payment.  Nevertheless, the applicant showed that he reduced his overall debt by 95% and the\nBoard affirmed the decision to grant that applicant a clearance.  Applicant\u2019s financial case is similar\nto ISCR Case No. 04-07360.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the\nfacts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the concerns\npertaining to financial considerations.  Substantial evidence supports Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability. I take this position based on the law, my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person\nfactors\u201d  and supporting evidence, as well as my application of the pertinent factors under the\n4\nAdjudicative Process. \nThus, after looking at the whole person, including his long history of responsible conduct,\nand also considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for\nApplicant under SOR Paragraph 1 as he mitigated the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through\n1.q.  \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make\nthe following formal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nEric A. Eisen, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 14, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\n\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in failing to mitigate\nthe Guideline F security concerns raised in the SOR; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis\nis arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant, 68 years old at the close\nof the record, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1982, and was released from his\ndischargeable debts the same year.  Applicant subsequently invested in a company that contracts with\nthe DoD, owning 51% of the stock.  The company filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to having lost\na bid for a contract.  In the 1990s, Applicant\u2019s company won a bid to manufacture items for the DoD\nbut suffered a cash flow problem, resulting in the reopening of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nAs a consequence of these financial problems, the company stopped paying its own federal taxes and\nthe tax withholdings of its employees.  As president and stockholder of the company, Applicant is\npersonally liable to the IRS for approximately $1,105,000.  Applicant\u2019s company remains in Chapter\n11 bankruptcy.  Applicant lives frugally, his income consisting of a small salary from his company\nand social security payments.  Applicant and his company are currently negotiating offers in\ncompromise with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Applicant submitted evidence to the effect\nthat he is a person of the highest character, integrity, and trustworthiness.\nApplicant has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not at issue in this\nappeal.  See ISCR Case 04-11369 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 16, 2007).  \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nWhile acknowledging the extent of his debt, Applicant contends that any security concerns\nassociated with it are mitigated.  For example, Applicant argues that the basis for the debt, business\n\nDirective \u00b6  E2.A6.1.3.3.\n1\nDirective \u00b6  E2.A6.1.3.2.\n2\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.1.\n3\nThe Judge also concluded that Applicant\u2019s debt to the IRS was recent and that it was not isolated.  This is\n4\nconsistent with the ongoing nature of a federal tax debt, which is not extinguished by bankruptcy.  See ISCR Case No.\n02-31406 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2006) (\u201cIn this case, the Administrative Judge found that Applicant had a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations which extended over many years.  He had only recently resolved many of his debts and at\nthe time the case was submitted for decision still had significant outstanding debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge\ncould reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent, not isolated, and still ongoing.\u201d)   \n3\nmisfortune, was beyond his control,  was isolated,  and not recent.   The gravamen of Applicant\u2019s\n1\n2\n3\nbrief on appeal, however, is that he is a mature man of high integrity who will not act to the\ndetriment of his country, even if tempted by promises to pay off his debt.  Applicant cites to a\nnumber of Hearing Office cases which he believes are consistent with granting him a clearance.  \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s brief in light of the Judge\u2019s decision and the record as a\nwhole.  While the Judge acknowledged the centrality of Applicant\u2019s business downturn to his\nfinancial problems, he nevertheless concluded that Applicant\u2019s tax debt is, to an extent, within his\ncontrol.  \u201cApplicant\u2019s company was obligated to withhold funds from the employees\u2019 wages for their\nfederal income tax.  The company did not fulfill the further obligation to pay that money to the IRS.\nThe company chose to utilize money owed to the U.S. Government in an attempt to save a\nfloundering company.  That is not a valid business decision.\u201d  Decision at 7.  The Judge went on to\nobserve that Applicant\u2019s payments to the IRS \u201chave been minimal compared with the amount of the\ndebts.\u201d  Id.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion that the\nsecurity concerns in his case had been mitigated.   This conclusion bears a rational relation to the\n4\nJudge\u2019s unchallenged findings.  Therefore, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s treatment of the mitigating\nconditions is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.  \nAs far as the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is concerned, he gave explicit consideration to\nApplicant\u2019s professional accomplishments and his \u201cimpeccable character evidence.\u201d  Id.  He\nbalanced that against the extent of Applicant\u2019s tax debt, concluding that it \u201craises his potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  Id.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis\ncomplies with the requirements of Directive  \u00b6  E2.2.1, in that he considered the totality of\nApplicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.  See ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May 19,\n2006).\nThe Board gives due consideration to the Hearing Office cases which Applicant has\nsubmitted in his appeal brief.  However, such decisions are binding neither on Hearing Office Judges\nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 03-26115 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2007).  \nOrder\n\n4\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan          \nMichael Y.

On June 14, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 26, 2006,\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on\nDecember 18, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on January 24, 2007, scheduling the hearing for\nFebruary 20, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted a Hearing Memorandum which was marked Hearing Exhibit\n(HE) I. Department Counsel\u2019s letter forwarding the Memorandum is HE II. The Government offered\neleven exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, and admitted without\nobjection. Applicant testified and offered eight exhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE)\nA through H, and admitted without objection. During his testimony, Applicant adopted the facts\ncontained in HE I.  The record was left open to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional\n2\nmaterial. He did so in a timely manner. The documents included income tax forms and returns (AE\nI), IRS statement (AE J), IRS negotiation documents (AE K), house documents (AE L), and letter\nfrom trustee (AE M). The letter from Applicant\u2019s counsel was marked HE III. Department Counsel\u2019s\nletter forwarding the documents is HE IV. Department Counsel objected to one of the documents\ncontained in AE L, on the basis of relevancy and lack of foundation. That objection is overruled. AE\nI through M are admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 68-year-old president, and at one time sole stockholder, of a defense\ncontractor. He is married, but separated. He has four adult children from his first marriage, and three\nminor children from his current marriage. Applicant\u2019s wife and children live in a foreign country,\nwhere she works for a non-governmental organization (NGO). Applicant has spent time in college,\nbut does not have a degree. Applicant served in the United States Air Force from 1956 to 1959, and\nwas honorably discharged.  \n3\nWithin two years of his discharge from the Air Force, Applicant started on the ground floor\nin a company within a high visibility industry. Applicant\u2019s background and circumstances were such\n\nTr. at; HE I at 2-3.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; HE I at 5.\n5\nTr. at 17-18, 46-50; HE I at 3.\n6\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission web site, www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/bankrupt.htm.\n7\nGE 6 at 18.\n8\nTr. at 51-54, 77; HE I at 3-4.\n9\n4\nthat his hiring by the company was groundbreaking. Applicant was a pioneer in his industry and\nachieved tremendous success.  \n4\nApplicant invested in a business in the early 1980s. The business failed, and Applicant filed\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1982. He was released from his dischargeable debts in 1982.5\nIn 1987, Applicant invested in a company involved in defense contracts. He purchased 51%\nof the stock in the company and was installed as the company president. Prior to the purchase, the\ncompany entered into a lease of additional facilities at a high price, in anticipation of receiving a new\ndefense contract. In 1988, the contract was awarded to another company. Applicant suspects\nfavoritism was involved in the contract decision, as the new president of that company was a former\nhigh-ranking government official. The company that was awarded the contract hired many of\nApplicant\u2019s employees to fulfill their contract. Applicant moved the company several times to\nsmaller spaces as his workforce shrank. His company filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.6\nFederal bankruptcy laws govern how companies go out of business or recover from crippling debt.\nA bankrupt company might use Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to \"reorganize\" its business and\ntry to become profitable again. Management continues to run the day-to-day business operations but\nall significant business decisions must be approved by a bankruptcy court.  \n7\nThe company\u2019s business improved. Bankruptcy records show that Applicant received\n$245,000 income from the company in 1994, and $257,000 in 1995.8\nIn the 1990s, Applicant\u2019s company won a bid to manufacture items as part of a defense\ncontract. The contract did not provide for prepayment, resulting in a cash flow problem. The\ncompany used factors, a form of financing which accrued interest at 18% to 24%, to finance the\ncontract. The factoring costs grew rapidly. Applicant refinanced personal real estate property, and\ninvested an additional $130,000 in the business. The company could not maintain the contract and\nhad to subcontract it to another company. Applicant\u2019s company lost all its profits on the contract,\nhis personal real estate properties were foreclosed, and the Chapter 11 filing was reopened.  \n9\nAs Applicant\u2019s business went bad, the company stopped paying their federal taxes. Applicant\nadmitted to owing all the taxes as alleged in the SOR. The company was obligated to withhold tax\nfrom their employees\u2019 pay, which would be turned over to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a\nquarterly basis. The company failed to pay the IRS the withholding for their employees during a\nnumber of quarters in 1995 and 1996. Applicant\u2019s company owed the IRS more than $2,480,000 in\nquarterly taxes, interest, and penalties, as reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, and 1.f through 1.j.

As of September 11, 2006, that debt\nhad grown to more than $1,105,000.10\nApplicant filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996. In 1997, the bankruptcy was converted to\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant was released from his dischargeable debts in 1997.  \n11\nApplicant\u2019s company remains in Chapter 11. An Examiner was appointed in 1996. By that\ntime, Applicant was the sole stockholder of the company. A reorganization plan was confirmed in\n1997. The Examiner now serves as Disbursing Agent and Plan Administrator. The plan provided that\nthe company\u2019s stock was extinguished and then the same type of stock reissued and held in trust. The\nstock continues to be held in trust. Applicant manages and runs the company on a day to day basis,\nessentially without interference from the Plan Administrator. Upon satisfaction of all debt claims,\n50% of the stock in trust will pass to Applicant, and the balance placed in the corporate treasury for\nissuance to future investors, or for other business purposes.12\nThe Plan Administrator has provided oversight of Applicant and his company for more than\nten years. He always found Applicant to be honest, hard-working, and cooperative. He never\nobserved Applicant engage in any illegal or unethical activities, and believes Applicant has always\nattempted to be \u201ca good American and a good corporate citizen.\u201d13\nThere is no evidence that Applicant committed any illegal activity or wrongdoing during the\nChapter 11 bankruptcy. It appears he had the best interests of his company and employees in mind.\nIn the early stages of the bankruptcy, Applicant refused to accept a salary, and turned over many of\nhis uncashed salary checks to the Plan Administrator. Those checks are in storage, but the Plan\nAdministrator estimates their value to be in the tens of thousands of dollars.  \n14\nThe company has repaid approximately $100,000 in state tax debt, and $400,000 in salaries\nthrough the Chapter 11. The company has resolved all debts except that owed to the IRS.15\nApplicant has been attempting to negotiate and settle with the IRS for a number of years,\nissuing several Offers in Compromise (OIC) since 1998. The IRS has not accepted any of his OICs.\nThere are two OICs pending, one on behalf of the company, and one for Applicant\u2019s personal\nliability. Applicant believes the OIC for the company is to pay about $85,000, and the OIC for his\npersonal liability is about $15,000. The OIC on behalf of Applicant\u2019s company proposed to pay\n$1,483 per month. The payments must be made while the IRS is considering the OIC.

The January, February, and March 2007\npayments were made on February 21, 2007. Applicant testified that the IRS levied his company\nabout $130,000 last year. He stated he has been paying $250 per month since last fall in connection\nwith the OIC for his personal tax liability. He submitted documentation of three payments of $250\nto the IRS. Documentation appears to show that the IRS levied Applicant\u2019s Social Security payment\nfor $259 per month, starting in February 2006. Applicant testified that to his knowledge, the levy on\nhis Social Security check never started.   \n16\nApplicant now lives a much simpler, less extravagant life. He shares a rented apartment for\nwhich he pays $500 per month. His estranged wife received their house, which is now worth more\nthan $1,000,000, along with any mortgage payments. His children receive Social Security benefits\nbased upon his earnings, and he has no independent child support obligations. He essentially lives\non his annual salary from his company of about $10,000, his pension, and his Social Security.17\nApplicant presented outstanding character evidence. An internationally prominent and well-\nrespected member of Applicant\u2019s prior industry has known Applicant for more than 40 years. He\nstates Applicant is a patriot, with \u201cplatinum character, underpinned by sobering honesty,\ntrustworthiness and unflagging dependability.\u201d  Other letters praise him as a man of high integrity\n18\nand honor, trustworthy, gifted, talented, kind, and considerate, whose \u201cloyalty to America, its\ncitizens, family and friends is above reproach.\u201d19\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n20\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n21\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n22\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n23\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n24\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n25\n7\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n23\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n24\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n25\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the\nDirective.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), apply in this case. Applicant declared bankruptcy in 1982 and 1996,\nand has a large unpaid debt to the IRS.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (It\nwas an isolated incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \n\n8\nApplicant has an extensive debt to the IRS that remains unpaid. He declared bankruptcy in\n1982 and 1996. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 do not apply. \nThe most important factor related to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties was his business\ndownturn. That condition was largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. I cannot hold that Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to pay the IRS during the downturn was largely beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s company was\nobligated to withhold funds from the employees\u2019 wages for their federal income tax. The company\ndid not fulfill the further obligation to pay that money to the IRS. The company chose to utilize\nmoney owed to the U.S. Government in an attempt to save a floundering company. That is not a\nvalid business decision. FC MC E2.A6.1.3. is partially applicable.\nThe payments to the IRS by Applicant\u2019s company, and by him personally, have been minimal\ncompared with the amount of the debts. Applicant only recently started making payments on his\npersonal debt. At most he has voluntarily paid about $2,000 toward a $1,100,000 debt. It is unclear\nif the IRS is levying Applicant\u2019s Social Security check. If the Social Security checks have been\nlevied, approximately $3,000 additional has been repaid to the IRS. That does not constitute a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. The IRS has not agreed to accept\nthe OICs. Applicant did not submit sufficient evidence for a finding that his financial problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 are not applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \nApplicable has impeccable character evidence. He served our country in the Air Force and\nreceived an Honorable Discharge. In the 1960s, Applicant was a pioneer in his field, accomplishing\nthings never done before. At the pinnacle of his career, he became an entrepreneur, earning about\n$250,000, in both 1994 and 1995. Unfortunate business events led to losses and unpaid taxes.\nApplicant\u2019s personal liability to the IRS is at least $1,100,000. He has been attempting to negotiate\nwith the IRS for a number of years, issuing several OICs. Applicant has addressed his corporate debt\nfor state taxes and other debtors. The corporation\u2019s debt and Applicant\u2019s personal debt to the IRS\nremain almost totally unpaid. Applicant\u2019s current standard of living is more akin to when he first\nstarted out in the 1960s. As long as the debt to the IRS hangs over Applicant\u2019s head, he cannot return\nto his previous standard of living. Applicant\u2019s tax debt raises his potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nraised by his financial issues.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

(Applicant\u2019s answer to the\n1\nSOR; Tr. 114)\n2\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of prescription painkillers in the late 1990s and from July to December\n2006, along with his alcohol abuse between 1998 and 2003, with continued use of alcohol to at least\nSeptember 2006, when he began medication to help him abstain, falls within the scope of the drug\nand alcohol guidelines of the Directive. While Applicant believes he has always been honest about\nhis substance abuse, the supervisor provided very little information about his drug and alcohol use.\nApplicant claimed he kept appointments with his counselor throughout each month of his relapse,\nbut the counselor indicated he did not see Applicant during his relapse. While Applicant\u2019s job\nperformance evidence is impressive, it does not overcome the misrepresentations he made about his\ndrug use. Even though Applicant added anti-craving medication to his alcohol and drug rehabilitation\nregimen, the current period that he has been abstinent from drugs and alcohol is insufficient to\nwarrant findings in his favor under the drug and alcohol guidelines. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn March 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as reissued through Change 4\nthereto, dated April 20, 1999, with revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for Determining Eligibility\nfor Determining Access to Classified Information, made effective on September 1, 2006, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant indicating that based on his drug involvement\n(Guideline H) and alcohol consumption (Guideline G), DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied\nor revoked. On May 1, 2007, Applicant provided answers to all allegations (his answers were\nnotarized on May 9, 2007) of the SOR and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. \nOn June 29, 2007, this case was assigned to me. On July 10, 2007, this case was scheduled\nfor hearing on August 15, 2007. The Government\u2019s two exhibits (GE), and Applicant\u2019s three exhibits\n(AE) were admitted in evidence. Testimony was taken from Applicant, his supervisor, and his\ncounselor. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 4, 2007. \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nPursuant to E3.1.17. of the Directive, I am amending the SOR so that it conforms to the\nevidence presented. SOR 1.a. (pain killers) shall be amended by changing \u201cJune 2002\" to \u201cMarch\n13, 2001.\u201d Also, in SOR 1.a., \u201cDecember of 2006\" shall be modified \u201cto December 9, 2006.\u201d  SOR\n1\n\n3\n1.b.

(cocaine) is amended by replacing \u201cthrough March 2001\" with \u201cto 2000\nor earlier.\u201d (Tr. 120) SOR 1.e. (marijuana) is amended by replacing \u201cthrough June 1, 2002\" with \u201cto\nthe late 1990s.\u201d (Tr. 121) \nAs noted on page 17 of the transcript, Applicant sought to have AE D admitted in evidence.\nDepartment Counsel observed the character statement was not signed. I marked the exhibit as AE\nD, and returned the document to Applicant, and told him he could cure the deficiency in the exhibit.\n(Tr. 17-19) No additional exhibits were submitted. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR has 11 allegations under paragraph 1; Applicant admitted each allegation with\nexplanation. The second paragraph has three allegations; Applicant admitted all allegations with\nexplanation. He considers his awards, his supervisor\u2019s and counselor\u2019s knowledge of his drug\nhistory, his participation in AA, ongoing treatment, and demonstrated forthrightness in voluntarily\ndisclosing his past drug abuse and relapse, sufficiently mitigate the adverse evidence of his drug\nhistory. \nApplicant is 29 years old and has been employed as an industrial engineer with a defense\ncontractor since December 2003. He seeks a secret clearance. He shares a dwelling with his\ngirlfriend (since November 2004) he plans to marry in 2008. \nDrug Involvement. Applicant began college in March 1993 and received his degree in\nindustrial engineering in 2003. While in college, he used mescaline (1.h.) in 1994 and 1995,\npsychotropic mushrooms (1.g.) from 1994 to 1996, methamphetamines (1.f.) from 1995 to 1999, and\nmarijuana (1.e.) from 1996 to the late 1990s. The aforementioned drugs were used on an infrequent\nor sporadic basis in the identified time periods.\nApplicant used GHB (1.b.) on a daily basis, and was hospitalized twice in 1998 (1.j.) for\nGHB overdoses. During two periods between January 1998 to March 13, 2001, and July 2006 to\nDecember 9, 2006, as set forth in 1.a. of the SOR, Applicant abused prescription painkillers. In\nOctober 1998 (1.k.), Applicant was terminated from his employment for misuse of pain medication.\nHe received intensive outpatient treatment (1.i.) from the summer of 1997 through 1998 for chemical\ndependency and substance abuse.\nApplicant began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in 1998. He indicates that he has\nsustained participation in three AA chapters since 1998 at differing meeting frequencies. (GE 2, GE\n3) He began consulting with his licensed professional counselor (LPC) in the summer of 1997 for\npersonal issues including alcohol use. Though the professional consultations have continued to the\npresent, Applicant\u2019s abuse of unprescribed painkillers persisted until March 2001. Except for alcohol\nconsumption (Tr. 86), Applicant used no illegal drugs from March 2001 to July 2006, but his\npainkiller abuse resumed to a frequency of about twice a month in July 2006. In August 2006,\nApplicant indicated he increased his painkiller use to twice a week, and then to daily use for the first\n\n Applicant testified he was nominated and received a coveted award (the second highest honor that an employee\n2\ncan receive) during his worse drug use. (Tr. 134) His answer reflects he received the award in May 2007.\n Applicant also explained he advised his girlfriend about his drug use in late September 2006. (Tr. 135-137)\n3\n This award is referenced in footnote number 2.\n4\n Id. \n5\n The LPC testified he performs essentially the same services as a licenced clinical social worker (LCSW). (Tr.\n6\n60)\n4\ntwo weeks of September 2006 (Tr. 134),  before decreasing to lesser frequencies until he stopped\n2\nall use in December 2006.\nApplicant opined that his relapse in July 2006 resulted from becoming complacent and\noverconfident about the strength of his recovery. While he indicates he continued to attend AA\nmeetings during his relapse, he was not doing the step work, a necessary component of AA and\nsuccessful recovery. In addition, he indicated the second reason for his relapse was that he was not\nconsulting with his LPC as frequently as he should have, although he claims he continued to see his\ncounselor throughout the course of the relapse. Applicant believes he advised the LPC of his relapse\nin September 2006. (Tr. 128-131)  The counselor stated he did not see Applicant nor hear about his\n3\nrelapse until December 2006. (Tr. 92) Further, his LPC indicated Applicant told him the worse\nperiod of abuse was in December 2006. (Tr. 90) Although the LPC could have been mistaken in his\nrecall about Applicant\u2019s consultations and his most serious drug abuse, I do not find that explanation\nthe most reasonable under these circumstances. These different accounts of when the consultations\noccurred and the most serious periods of his painkiller abuse between Applicant and his counselor\nare resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor since December 2003 indicated Applicant was promoted from\nindustrial engineer to senior industrial engineer in less than two years after his hire. The supervisor\ntestified that Applicant produces outstanding work, and has become an expert for gauging project\ncosts. The supervisor endorsed a special recognition award for Applicant in March 2007 for his job\nperformance. According to the supervisor, Applicant also received another prestigious award in May\n2007 because of his outstanding work.  \n4\nWhen asked what he knew about Applicant\u2019s most recent drug use, the supervisor stated he\ndidn\u2019t know any details other than there were drug problems in the past. (Tr. 41) The supervisor did\nnot want to obtain the details of Applicant\u2019s past drug use and Applicant did not offer any\ninformation.5\nAfter being qualified in the field of treatment of substance abusers(Tr. 62),  Applicant\u2019s LPC\n6\ntestified about his professional relationship with Applicant since 1997. The LPC testified that his\nconsultations with Applicant occurred about once a month until the relapse in July 2006, and then\ntwice a month after he learned about the relapse in December 2006. Concerning Applicant\u2019s use of\nGHB in the middle to late 1990s, the LPC made an initial diagnosis of drug abuse, but changed it\nto drug dependence after observing Applicant\u2019s emerging denial mechanisms during his early\nconsultations with Applicant. The LPC has found Applicant always willing to share his knowledge\n\n The medication reduces cravings for alcohol and drugs. It does not allow alcohol or narcotics to metabolize,\n7\nand has no side effects. (Tr. 67, 100)\n5\nwith others in achieving successful recovery. (Tr. 76-78) Based on Applicant\u2019s commitment to all\nelements of AA, group therapy, his support network (including his parents and girlfriend), his\npreventive medications, and his candor, specifically following his relapse, the LPC opined\nApplicant\u2019s prognosis was very good. (Tr. 70, 75, 78-80) \nWhen asked to discuss the relationship between Applicant\u2019s drug use and alcohol use, the\nLPC believed Applicant\u2019s alcohol use was secondary to his drug use, explaining that the alcohol use\nlowers the inhibition that curbs the activation of the addictive process. (Tr. 75). At some time, the\nLPC recommended Applicant obtain medication like the one identified in 2.a.  of the SOR (Tr. 95),\n7\nand he began taking the 2.a. medication after December 2006. (Tr. 94) The LPC believes that\ndiscontinuance of the 2.a. medication by Applicant would not be helpful. The LPC envisions\nApplicant returning to once-a-month therapy when his stress lessens. (Tr. 103)\nAlcohol Consumption. There are three allegations under the alcohol consumption guideline.\nAs noted in the Drug Involvement section above, Applicant has been taking the 2.a. medication\nsince September 2006 to prevent alcohol use and more serious use of his drug of choice. Based on\nApplicant\u2019s understanding from his doctor that he can take the drug indefinitely because it has no\nside effects, Applicant intends to continue taking the drug. (Tr. 141) In addition, taking the drug\nprovides his girlfriend piece of mind and a warning signal should he stop taking the drug. (Tr. 141-\n142)\nApplicant described his alcohol use over the last four years as approximately a couple times\na month until the beginning of 2006 when it became more infrequent. (Tr. 132) He is not certain\nwhen his last binge drinking occurred, but surmised it may have been in late 2005. He made the\ndecision to stop drinking alcohol in September 2006, although he testified his last drink was in late\nAugust 2006. (2.c; Tr. 133) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified he has traveled several times with Applicant to a midwest\nmilitary facility for meetings. While his supervisor observed Applicant consume alcohol on other\ntrips, the supervisor recalled Applicant drinking only club soda on the last trip. (Tr. 33) Regarding\nApplicant\u2019s overall alcohol use, his supervisor noted that Applicant mentioned something about a\nquestion on the SCA that asked about participation in treatment; the supervisor then stated he did\nnot know about Applicant\u2019s alcohol use. (Tr. 42) \nThe LPC testified he began treating Applicant in 1997 while working at the hospital\n(identified in 1.i. and 2.b.), and has continued consulting Applicant in private therapy. The LPC\ntestified that Applicant\u2019s binge drinking occurred mainly in college, and was unaware of any visible\nproblems afterward. (Tr. 88) The LPC\u2019s original diagnosis of Applicant in 1998 was alcohol abuse,\nand continues to be alcohol abuse. (Tr. 106) \nCharacter Evidence. In addition to the seven performance awards listed in his answer to the\nSOR, the record contains Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation (AE A) for 2006 acknowledging his\nextensive contributions to his employer\u2019s projects. The special recognition award (AE B) was signed\nby Applicant\u2019s supervisor on March 5, 2007, and extols Applicant\u2019s dedication to his project\n\n6\nassignments, as well as his performance on those assignments. On August 15, 2005 (AE C),\nApplicant typed a one-page e-mail expressing his intention to abstain from illegal drug use and\nmisuse of legal drugs in the future; he also declared that a failure to comply with his intention to\nmaintain abstinence in the future would result in revocation of any security clearance. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nDrug Involvement (DI)\nUsing illegal drugs or unprescribed legal drugs, which casts doubt regarding a person\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, also raises questions about his willingness to comply with regulations.\nAlcohol Consumption (AC)\nExcessive use of alcohol leads to the exercise of poor judgment while presenting questions\nabout a person\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n As noted in section 24.b. of the Directive, drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\n8\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n7\nDrug Involvement (DI). The illegal use of drugs or the misuse of prescription drugs  casts\n8\ndoubt on a person\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness and also his ability to comply with laws and\nregulations. The record reflects Applicant abused several drugs from 1996 to March 2001. His abuse\nof six of the drugs was primarily occasional in scope. His abuse of GHB must be characterized as\naddictive in scope as he was using the drug on a daily basis, and was hospitalized twice for GHB\noverdoses. The passage of about six years with no evidence of subsequent abuse of these illegal\ndrugs warrants favorable findings under subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.j.\nApplicant\u2019s overall use of painkillers, specifically his misuse from July to December 2006,\nsatisfies DI disqualifying condition (DC) 25.a. (any drug abuse) and DI DC 25.c. (illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution) Since\nthe LPC is not a licensed clinical social worker, and provided no evaluation regarding Applicant\u2019s\nabuse of unprescribed painkillers, DI DC 25.e. (evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized treatment program) does not\napply. When the LPC (as a staff member of a recognized treatment program) delivered his diagnosis\nof Applicant in 1998, it applied to GHB, not misuse of prescription painkillers. \nApplicant has repeatedly stated in his answer and during the hearing that he has been honest\nin keeping the appropriate parties aware of his drug use and his relapse on painkillers. However, his\nsupervisor\u2019s testimony reflects he knew very little about Applicant\u2019s past drug use, and even less\nabout his alcohol abuse. The LPC testified he did not see Applicant until after the relapse in\nDecember 2006 when Applicant told him his painkiller abuse was at its worse. \nThe lack of detail by the supervisor regarding Applicant\u2019s drug and alcohol abuse may be a\nminor point. However, as stated in the factual findings, the supervisor\u2019s lack of detail, coupled with\nthe substantial differences in testimony between when Applicant claims he saw his LPC, and when\nthe LPC saw Applicant, weakens the credibility of Applicant\u2019s statements not only about his\ncontinued treatment during his relapse, but other statements he made about his painkiller abuse, e.g.,\nscope and frequency of the abuse, and the status of his recovery. In sum, I do not find Applicant was\nbeing forthright when he claimed he consulted with his LPC throughout the relapse. In addition, I\nfind his misuse of prescribed medication was at its worse in December and not September 2006, as\nhe claims. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor casts lingering security concerns about his reliability and\ntrustworthiness. These concerns have not been sufficiently mitigated by his character evidence or\nDI mitigating condition (MC) 26.b. (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future).\nWhile Applicant has the support of his girlfriend and his parents in achieving a drug free\nenvironment, eight months is insufficient time for me to confidently conclude he has his\nunprescribed drug use safely in his past, particularly because of his compromised credibility.\nSubparagraph 1.a. is found against Applicant. \nAlcohol Consumption (AC). As with abuse of illegal or unprescribed drugs, excessive\nalcohol consumption may lead to questionable judgment while raising questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. The government\u2019s evidence reflects binge consumption\nof alcohol during his college years until 2003 as indicated by the LPC. AC DC 22.c. (habitual or\nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\n\n8\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. Applicant was\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser in 1998 when his LPC was a member of a recognized treatment\nprogram. The LPC testified his diagnosis would continue to be alcohol abuse at the present time. I\nfind AC DC 22.e. (evaluation of alcohol abuse alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized treatment program) applies in conjunction with AC\nDC 22.f. (relapse of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation \nprogram) based on (1) Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse history following outpatient treatment and AA\nparticipation since the late 1990s, and (3) the counselor\u2019s current alcohol abuse diagnosis/evaluation.\nGiven (1) Applicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol consumption characterized by his LPC\u2019s\nalcohol abuse evaluations in 1998 and currently, (2) his alcohol consumption to at least September\n2006, even though he has been aware of likelihood he could return to his drug of choice with\ncontinued drinking, AC MC 23.a. (so much time has passed, or behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment) does not apply. \nApplicant acknowledges his alcohol abuse, and claims he has taken appropriate action to\nresolve the problem. However, AC MC 23.b. (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism\nor issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser)\nhas only limited application. There has been an ample amount of testimony of Applicant\u2019s\nparticipation in AA over the years. However, Applicant has continued to drink alcohol until\nSeptember 2006, notwithstanding his knowledge that drinking could increase the chances of\nresumption of his drug of choice. The implementation of the anti-craving medication in September\n2006 into Applicant\u2019s recovery regimen is favorable as it decreases the chances he will use alcohol\nin the future. However, using one medication to prevent the use of another drug or drugs raises\nsecurity concerns about the strength of Applicant\u2019s recovery. Given his ten year alcohol history,\nwhich has been diagnosed/evaluated as alcohol abuse by by his LPC, an insufficient period of\nabstinence or responsible use has transpired for me to find Applicant has overcome the adverse\nevidence under the AC guideline. \nAC MC 23.d. (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling\nor rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established\npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such\nas participation in meetings of AA or similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of\na recognized alcohol treatment program) does not apply because all the elements are not present.\nWhile Applicant completed the outpatient counseling in February 1998, he continued to abuse other\ndrugs and alcohol to March 2001. The favorable evidence of abstinence from the other identified\ndrugs between 2001 to July 2006 must be balanced against Applicant\u2019s occasional alcohol abuse and\nuse until September 2006, when he began use of a medication to help him abstain from alcohol use.\nEven though his LPC furnished a good prognosis for Applicant, insufficient time has passed for me\nto find in Applicant\u2019s favor under the AC guideline. I find for Appellant under subparagraph 2.a. but\nagainst him under subparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c.\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions connected to both guidelines of the\nDirective, I have also considered the circumstances of this case under the whole person model of the\n\n9\nDirective. Applicant\u2019s misuse of painkillers in the late 1990s, and from July to December 2006,\nraises serious reliability and trustworthiness concerns. While Applicant has repeatedly declared his\nopenness about the painkiller use, his supervisor knew little or nothing about either drugs or alcohol.\nApplicant unequivocally stated he kept his LPC advised throughout the entire course of his relapse.\nBut his LPC, who has treated him since 1998, did not see Applicant for at least three months of the\nrelapse. When he reestablished contact, Applicant identified December, not September 2006, as the\nworse period of painkiller abuse. Applicant has furnished praiseworthy exhibits and testimony about\nhis job performance since December 2003. However, this favorable character evidence and his stated\nintentions to forego future drug and alcohol use, provide little insight into the reasons for Applicant\u2019s\nmisrepresentations about critical events during his relapse. These misrepresentations carry a negative\nimpact on his reliability and trustworthiness under the drug and alcohol guidelines that are not\novercome or excused by his topnotch character evidence.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 1. a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Alcohol Consumption, Guideline G):  AGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Duffy, Esq. Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on July 7, 2003.\nOn March 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under criminal conduct\n(Guideline H), personal conduct (Guideline E), and financial considerations (Guideline\nF). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR was received on May 12, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on July 28, 2008, and the hearing was held on August 11,\n2008. At the hearing, seven exhibits (GE 1 through GE 7) were admitted in evidence\nwithout objection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and one exhibit\n(AE A) was admitted in evidence to support his case. \nSeptember 29, 2008\n\n The civil complaint (GE 6) identifies May 14, 1999, as the first time the fellatio sexual conduct occurred.\n1\n2\nOn August 14 and August 18, 2008, Applicant presented two exhibits following\nthe hearing. Department Counsel reviewed the exhibits, and did not object to their\nadmission in evidence. AE B contains three money order receipts pertaining to the civil\njudgment described in SOR 2.b. and referred to in SOR 3.a. AE C describes Applicant\u2019s\nwork performance for 2006 and 2007. DOHA received a copy of the hearing transcript\non September 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains one allegation under the criminal conduct guideline, two\nallegations under the personal conduct guideline, and five allegations under the financial\nconsiderations guideline. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations except for SOR 3.a.\nand 3.c., which he denied. \nApplicant, 45 years old, has been married to his wife for almost 23 years. His\ncurrent employer hired him in November 2002 as an operator/tester of hazardous\nmaterials. Before his current job, Applicant was a truck driver. Before the criminal\nconduct in July 1999, Applicant was a military police officer from 1990 to 1995. He was\na city police officer from 1995 to July 1999. Applicant seeks a security clearance. \nCriminal Conduct\nOn July 26, 1999 (SOR 1.a.), Applicant was a patrolman for a city police\ndepartment. He forced a woman to conduct fellatio sex with him. He was arrested on\nOctober 26, 1999, and charged with (1) felony sex offense 2  degree, (2) perverted\nnd\npractice, (3) misdemeanor sex offense 4  degree, (4) assault 2  degree, (5) misconduct\nth\nnd\nin office, (6) felony sex offense 2  degree, (7) perverted practice, (8) misdemeanor sex\nnd\noffense 4  degree, (9) assault 2  degree, and (10) misconduct in office. On April 4,\nth\nnd\n2000, a plea bargain resulted in Applicant pleading guilty to counts 7 and 10. (GE 5) He\nreceived a two-year suspended sentence, and two years probation. According to the\nvictim, the fellatio occurred in July, and two months earlier in May 1999 by force. After\nthe July 1999 sexual act, the victim retained as evidence Applicant\u2019s semen in a cup.\n(GE 4, pp. 77-79) \nApplicant admitted SOR 1.a. (the criminal conduct allegation) but contended the\nsex was consensual rather than by force. He also denied he committed a similar act on\nthe victim in May 1999. The prosecutrix had informed her case manager (who taped the\nconversation) on May 19, 1999 that Applicant had forced her to have oral sex on May\n16, 1999. (GE 4, p. 79)1\n\n Under Section 20 of his SCA (\u201cYour Employment Record\u201d), Applicant stated, \u201cI HAD AN AFFAIR W HILE ON\n2\nDUTY AS A POLICE OFFICER.\u201d\n The exhibit actually contains whole or partial copies of five receipts\n3\n3\nIn Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA, GE 1) dated July 7, 2003, he\nadmitted the sexual misconduct in 1999. In the remarks section of GE 1, he stated: \nTHE TWO MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES I HAVE LISTED ARE THE\nRESULT OF MY HAVING AN AFFAIR WHILE ON DUTY AS A POLICE\nOFFICER. IN [STATE] IT IS ILLEGAL TO HAVE ORAL SEX WITH\nANYONE OTHER THAT YOUR SPOUSE (THIS IS THE PERVERTED\nPRACTICE CHARGE). THE CIVIL SUIT IS ALSO RELATED TO THAT\nINCIDENT.  \n2\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant was suspended (SOR 2.a.) by the police department in approximately\nJuly 1999 for the criminal conduct that occurred on July 26, 1999. In October 1999, the\nsuspension was extended without pay. On April 4, 2000, Applicant resigned from the\npolice department. \nA civil lawsuit (SOR 2.b.) was filed in May 2002 based on the criminal, sexual\nacts in July and May 1999. The case was settled against Applicant for $13, 750.00.\nApplicant began paying the judgment at $100.00 a month in 2004. He estimates he has\npaid about $3,700.00 to date. He submitted three $100.00 payment receipts that are\ndated October and December 2007, and one dated August 12, 2008, the day after the\nhearing. (Tr. 44; AE B)3\nFinancial Considerations\nSOR 3.a. Applicant estimates the civil judgment (SOR 2.b.) to be reduced to\nabout $10,050.00, because of his payments of $100.00 a month. Applicant intends to\nincrease the payments to $400.00 a month (from $100.00 a month) after he pays off the\nother debts. (Tr. 45-46) There is no agreement or correspondence to describe payment\nof the civil judgment (SOR 2.b.). Rather, Applicant was instructed by his attorney in\n2004 to submit monthly payments of $100.00. (SOR 2.b.) (Id. at 45)\nSOR 3.b. A credit card account was opened in 2004. The account was reported\ndelinquent in February 2008 in an amount of $793.00. Applicant has taken no action on\nthe account, but anticipates he will. \nSOR 3.c. The mortgage company debt was paid in July 2008. (AE A) Applicant\napparently took out a loan on his house to pay for truck driving school and other bills.\nThe loan became delinquent in 2004. (Tr. 48) Applicant contends that the original loan\nwas $13,000.00. (Tr. 21-22)\n\n4\nSOR 3.c., 3.d. Applicant claims the debts to both creditors (telecommunication\ncompanies) became delinquent in 2004. After the two creditors merged, Applicant is\nconfident his wife paid the debts. However, he has encountered difficulty receiving\ndocumentation from the creditors. No documentation was provided.  \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant testified that he belongs to a financial counseling program that instructs\nenrollees how \u201c... to make a budget, live within your budget, and pay all your bills, and\npay off one at a time, and then you get to the next one, and it\u2019s the snowball effect.\u201d (Tr.\n23) He indicated he paid most of the bills but his wife is having difficulty finding the\ndocumentation verifying the bills have been paid. (Tr. 24) Applicant\u2019s performance at his\ncurrent job for 2006 and 2007 has been exceptional. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. If residual\ndoubts still remain concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation, those doubts will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\n\n5\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nCriminal conduct (CC)\n30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30\nOn July 26, 1999, Applicant was a police officer authorized by a city police\ndepartment to uphold the law. He abused that authority by taking advantage of a female\nfor sexual gratification. I also find there is sufficient evidence to conclude he had\nengaged in the same conduct in May 1999. Though he complied with the terms of his\nsentence and probation, and is paying the victim a judgment for the same behavior, I\nam unable to conclude he accepts full responsibility for his grievous criminal behavior.\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct falls within CC disqualifying conditions (DC) 31.a. (a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and CC DC 31.c. (allegation of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted). \nThere are only two of four mitigating conditions that potentially apply to the facts:\nCC mitigating condition (MC) 32.a. (so much time has passed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) and CC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity development). Applicant acknowledged he pled guilty to one count of oral\nsex in April 2000. However, his denial of the second sexual act in May 1999 is not\naccepted in the face of credible statements made by the victim to her caseworker in GE\n4. Second, when Applicant filled out his SCA (GE 1) he described the criminal conduct\nas \u201can affair.\u201d An affair is characterized as a romantic attachment of short-term duration.\nHowever, if Applicant had sex with the victim on simply one occasion, it is not\nreasonable to believe he would have described the single sexual act as \u201can affair.\u201d\nFinally, both sexual acts (July 26, 1999, and May 14, 1999) were the gravamen of the\ncivil complaint filed against him in May 2002 that was settled against him for $13,750.00\nin August 2004. Applicant gains no mitigation from CC MC 32.a. \n\n6\nCC MC 32.d. identifies some elements of successful rehabilitation. But,\nsuccessful rehabilitation hinges on whether the individual fully realizes the\nconsequences of his actions. Applicant\u2019s denial that the May 1999 act occurred despite\nsignificant countervailing evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion he has yet to\nappreciate the gravity of his criminal conduct. Rehabilitation is not a mechanical process\nmeasured simply by the passage of time. Applicant\u2019s good employment record is\ninsufficient to find the CC guideline in his favor. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d AG \u00b6 15\nApplicant\u2019s suspension from the police department in July 1999 and the civil\njudgment rendered against him in August 2004 are cognizable under PC DC 16.d.\n(credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and\nmay not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined\nwith all available information supports a whole person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (1) or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality,\nrelease of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations).\nWhen Applicant forced the victim to have oral sex, he was not an ordinary person, but a\npolice officer sworn to make certain that persons do not become victimized by unlawful\nconduct. The criminal and civil judgments rendered against him establish the basis for\napplication of PC DC 16.d.\nThough Applicant has acknowledged some of his criminal conduct, his decision\nnot to take full responsibility for his behavior forecloses PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) from consideration. Applicant\u2019s compliance with the terms of probation weighs\nin his favor. But, agreeing that he only committed a portion of the criminal conduct that\ncould be independently established is not mitigated by the passage of time and\nsuccessful compliance with the terms of his probation. The PC guideline is resolved\nagainst Applicant.\n\n7\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable acts.\u201d AG \u00b6 18\nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness of approximately $10,000.00 from the civil judgment\n(SOR 2.a.), plus the credit card debt, and the telephone debt total about $11,000.00.\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties invoke FC DC 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) Applicant has yet\nto act on SOR 3.b. Though he claims he paid the telephone debts in SOR 3.d. and 3.e.,\nhe provided no documentary evidence to substantiate the debts were paid. Though he\nhas paid off the debt to SOR 3.b. in July 2008, he conceded the debt had become\ndelinquent in 2004. Applicant claims he has been paying $100.00 month on the civil\njudgment since 2004. Yet, his money order receipts show he has made three payments\nto the SOR 3.a. judgment creditor in 2007 and the first eight months of 2008. His\nexhibits reflect that his payments have been sporadic at best, with the most recent\npayment occurring a day after the hearing.\nThe only three mitigating conditions that are potentially applicable here are: FC\nMC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment); FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in th financial problems were beyond the person\u2019s control); FC MC 20.c. (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications the problem is being resolved or is under control); and, FC MC 20.d. (the\nindividual initiated good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts). Applicant still owes three creditors on four accounts. The lack of supporting\ndocumentation of his claim of having paid SOR creditor 3.a. $100.00 a month for the\npast four years is hard to believe based on the production of only three receipts in four\nyears. Applicant\u2019s purported payoffs of the creditors in SOR 3.d. and 3.e. are not\nbelievable because of the lack of supporting documentation. Applicant exercised good\njudgment in paying off SOR 3.c., however the debt had been delinquent since 2004.\nApplicant provided no evidence to demonstrate his participation in financial counseling.\nThere is no evidence to indicate the financial problems were the result of matters\noutside Applicant\u2019s control, and inside the purview of FC MC 20.b. The lack of\ndocumentation weighs heavily against Applicant\u2019s claim he has his financial house in\norder. Applicant has not met his burden under the FC guideline. \n\n8\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors define the WPC.\nThey are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nConsidering all available evidence, Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is outweighed\nby the unfavorable evidence. Applicant has not mitigated the CC, PC and FC guidelines.\nAt the age of 36 while employed as a police officer, Applicant violated his fiduciary duty\nto citizens of his employer by engaging in criminal misconduct, and then not being\nentirely forthright and remorseful about his behavior. He claimed he was engaged in\nfinancial counseling, yet provided no documentation of responsibly handling finances.\nHis mitigating evidence falls short of overcoming the negative evidence under the CC,\nPC and FC guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal conduct, Guideline J):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3a.\nAgainst Applicant.\nSubparagraph 3.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was charged with larceny in April 2001 for stealing a computer memory chip from\na university computer where he was a student. He did not reveal that arrest on his security clearance\napplication and lied about his involvement when interviewed by a government agent. He is ashamed\nof his misconduct, but it is not enough to mitigate the serious criminal conduct and personal conduct\nconcerns. Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by  \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 14,\n2006, detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\non December 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1,\n2006. The guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\nSOR on February 20, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on May 8, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on August 21, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. At the hearing, five\nGovernment exhibits (Ex. 1- 5 ) and four Applicant exhibits (A-D) were admitted. Testimony was\ntaken from the Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 5, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant was charged in April 2001 with larceny\nunder $250 and larceny from a building (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and he committed  a felony violation under 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001 because of the conduct alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline E,\nApplicant was alleged to have deliberately not disclosed his April 2001 arrest on his June 2002\nsecurity clearance application (SF 86) (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and to have falsely denied in a March 2003 sworn\nstatement that he had stolen a compute memory chip from a university computer in 2001 (SOR \u00b6\n2.b).\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the arrest and theft of the computer memory chip. While\nhe also admitted that he falsified material facts on his SF 86 by deliberately not listing his arrest and\nin his sworn statement by denying the theft of the computer chip, he explained he acted on the advice\nof the attorney who represented him at the time of his arrest. The attorney told him that since his case\nwas continued without a finding, it would \"go away\" after six months and he would never have to\ntell anyone of the incident and it could not be held against him. Applicant apologized for his poor\njudgment, and indicated he had taken several courses in ethics and security training as well and\nsought legal counseling to ensure against recurrence.\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 26-year-old systems engineer who has been employed by a defense contractor\nsince June 2002. He started as an intern while he was still in college, and held an interim secret\nclearance without incident for about four and one-half years until it was withdrawn.  \nIn September 1999, Applicant began his college studies in engineering at a branch of the state\nuniversity. In March 2001, Applicant stole a computer memory chip valued at $100 from a\nuniversity-owned computer located in a campus computer lab. He had been informed by his\n\nThe date of the hearing and the specific findings of the school judicial officer were not made available for my\n1\nreview.\nThe copy of the statement admitted into evidence as Exhibit 3 does not bear Applicant\u2019s signature as it is\n2\nmissing the third of three pages.  Notwithstanding that it is incomplete, it was admitted as Applicant filed no objection\nto it and he testified that he initialed each paragraph, including those included in Exhibit 3 (see Tr. 42).\n3\nroom/suite mate (student X) of the easy access to the memory chip and stole it because he wanted\nto add memory to his personal computer. On April 4, 2001, a resident student informed campus\npolice that he observed student X remove a flat screen computer monitor and accompanying power\nadapter from a computer lab on March 16, 2001. During the course of the investigation into the\nthefts, student X admitted to campus police that he had stolen the monitor and that the missing\nmemory chip had been taken by Applicant. When confronted by campus police, Applicant\nimmediately turned over the memory chip. He provided the police with a written statement at the\nstation, indicating that he had taken the random access memory about a month ago; that the front of\nthe case had been pried off already when he took the chip (\u201cI was wrong for taking it but all the work\nhad already been done and was out in the open.\u201d Ex. 4).  On April 18, 2001, Applicant was charged\nwith one count of larceny under $250 and with one count of larceny from a building. On May 10,\n2001, the larceny under $250 charge was continued without a finding until November 8, 2001, on\npayment of $100 costs and $35 victim witness assessment. The larceny from a building charge was\ndismissed. On November 7, 2001, Applicant\u2019s case was dismissed without a finding.\nApplicant also had a hearing before a university judicial officer as to whether he should face\ndisciplinary action from the university, including possible expulsion. Applicant was allowed to stay\nin school,  but was required to perform 40 hours of service at the college.\n1\nIn June 2002, Applicant began working for his employer as an intern. About two weeks later,\nhe completed a security clearance application (SF 86) in which he responded \u201cNO\u201d to the police\nrecord inquiries, including question 26 [\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with,\nor convicted of any of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic\nfines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.) For this item, report\ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken\nfrom the record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal\nControlled Substances Act for which the court issued and [sic] expungement order under the\nauthority of 21 U.S.C. 944 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d]. Applicant intentionally did not list the 2001 larceny\ncharges because he understood from the attorney who had represented him for the offense that there\nwould be no record of it since it had been dismissed without a finding. Applicant made no inquiries,\nincluding of legal or security personnel, whether he was justified in leaving off the charge.\nOn or about March 27, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense\nSecurity Service about the misdemeanor larceny charges filed against him in April 2001.  Applicant\n2\nadmitted he had been charged, but falsely claimed that he had purchased the memory chip for $50\nfrom student X, his room/suite mate at the time, not knowing that it had been stolen, that student X\nhad implicated him in the theft to get a lighter sentence for himself. Applicant denied that he had\nstolen anything from the school (\u201cI never stole any computer items, or anything else from the school,\nat any time. I never admitted to stealing anything and I never actually stole anything.\u201d see Ex. 3).\nApplicant also maintained that he had been \u201ccompletely exonerated\u201d at a school judicial officer\n\n4\nhearing. Concerning his failure to list the offense on his SF 86, Applicant explained that either his\nlawyer or a police sergeant had told him that the charges would be \u201cwiped out\u201d after six months, and\nit would be as if it never happened. Accordingly, \u201cassuming that no record would be found,\u201d he\nintentionally did not list the charge on his SF 86 even though he knew he was required to list it.\nIn May 2004, Applicant was awarded his bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering.\nAs an entry-level test design engineer I, he met all significant performance objectives/expectations\nin 2004 and 2005. Willing to step up and perform what was asked of him, Applicant fully supported,\nand developed good working relationships, with his team leadership and his peers. As of his\nevaluation in late 2005, he had exhibited great potential as an engineer. On the recommendation of\nhis department manager and the director of systems engineering, Applicant was promoted to systems\nengineer effective November 25, 2006, at an annual salary of $64,071.07. As of August 2007, he was\nworking as an aircraft integrator for a helicopter-based missile defense system. Applicant handled\nclassified material regularly until his interim secret clearance was withdrawn. No evidence of any\nviolations of security procedures was presented.\nApplicant has taken advantage of several online and in-person training courses offered by his\nemployer covering topics related to his specific position, to employee ethics, and to security\nawareness. As of February 2007, he had earned 119 training hours.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 provides in part:\n3\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowing and\nwillfully: (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact: (2) makes\nany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false\nwriting or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. (AG \u00b6 30) Applicant\u2019s theft of the computer memory chip from a university\ncomputer lab implicates Guideline J disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 31(a), a single serious crime\nor multiple lesser offenses, and \u00b6 31(c), allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, irrespective of the\ndismissal of the larceny charge after six months. Moreover, Applicant committed felony criminal\nconduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by deliberately concealing that theft from the government\nwhen he completed his SF 86 and when he was interviewed by the DSS agent (see Guideline E,\nsupra).  DC \u00b6 31(c) applies to his misrepresentations.\n3\nApplicant stole the computer chip when he was only 19, more than six years before his\nsecurity clearance hearing. Yet Applicant cannot avail himself of the benefit of mitigating condition\n32(a), so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. His larceny conduct cannot be viewed in isolation\nfrom his more recent criminal concealment of his involvement in the theft. Applicant\u2019s contributions\nto his employer, and his efforts to acquire ethics training in particular, reflect some reform as well\nas maturation (See MC \u00b6 32(d), there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement).\nHowever, doubts persist about Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation where he continues on some level to justify\nor minimize his misconduct. When asked by Department Counsel why he stole the computer chip,\nApplicant responded, \u201cThere was a lot of other students doing the same thing at the time and a\ncouple other students showed me how easy it was, and it was just extremely bad, irresponsible peer\npressure.\u201d (Tr. 44) When he answered the SOR, Applicant indicated that he lied to the DSS agent\nbecause his attorney had told him he did not have to tell anyone about it, and he feared the\ninformation would be used against him, \u201cthat [he] would lose [his] internship without being given\nthe chance to explain.\u201d\n\n6\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nApplicant was required to report his arrest for misdemeanor larceny valued under $250 and\nlarceny from a building on his SF 86 completed in June 2002, even though his case had been\ndismissed in November 2001.  He elected to not do so. Under Guideline E, conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during\nthe security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n(AG \u00b6 15) In his Answer, Applicant suggested that he acted in good faith on the advice of the\nattorney who represented him on the larceny charges:\nHe told me the effect of \u2018continued without a finding\u2019 is I would not have to tell\nanyone of the incident at all and that this incident could never be held against me. I\nnow know that I should not have answered question 26 on the SF 86 like I did  I\nshould have stated all the facts even if I was unsure, regardless of what my attorney\ntold me to do. I also now know that I should have asked the security people who were\nhelping me at the time for guidance.\nAt his security clearance hearing, he reiterated that he understood he would never have to tell anyone\nwhat happened. (Tr. 40). A good faith belief, albeit mistaken, that the charges were not required to\nbe reported would negate the willful intent that raises the security concern under \u00b6 16(a) deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities. Yet when questioned by the DSS agent in March 2003,\nApplicant indicated that while he had been told by his attorney that the larceny charge would be\n\u201cwiped out, he admitted he knew he was required to list the charge on his SF 86 but assumed no\nrecord would be found so he did not disclose it (see Ex. 3). DC \u00b6 16(a) applies.\nHad Applicant acted in good faith, he would not have lied about his involvement in the theft\nwhen questioned by the DSS agent. Instead, he falsely claimed to the agent that he had purchased\nthe memory chip from student X, had no reason to believe it had been stolen, and that he never stole\nany computer items from the school. His deliberate misrepresentations to the DSS agent not only\nnegate any claim of good faith reliance, but are potentially security disqualifying in their own right.\nGuideline E DC \u00b6 16(b), deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official\ngovernment representative, is also implicated.\nBy lying to the agent in March 2003, Applicant compounded the security concerns raised by\nhis SF 86 omission. MC \u00b6 17(a), the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts, clearly does not apply.\nNor does the evidence support favorable consideration of MC \u00b6 17(b), the refusal or failure to\ncooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or\ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement\nto cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully. Assuming\n\n7\nApplicant had been told by his attorney that he would never have to report the offense, this would\nnot qualify for MC \u00b6 17(b) as the advice was not given in the context of the security clearance\nprocess. Furthermore, it would not excuse the deliberate fabrications to the DSS agent, which causes\ngreater concern for his judgment and trustworthiness than had he initially refused to discuss the\nincident based on legal advice and then admitted his role in the theft after being apprised of his duty\nto cooperate.\nApplicant has apologized for his poor decisions, and submits in rehabilitation his completion\nof ethics training and counseling from an attorney. Applicant\u2019s training record (Ex. A) shows he\ncompleted about 12.5 hours of ethics training since June 2002, most of it after he was interviewed\nby the DSS agent. The only information about the counseling comes from Applicant, who indicated\nthe attorney taught him that even though his case was continued without a finding, he still had to\ndisclose it, and who taught him \u201cthe importance of full disclosure regarding anything to do with\nnational security.\u201d (See Answer) To the extent that Applicant suggests he did not know that he had\nto report the larceny charges until the counseling, he undercuts his claim of reform. He told the DSS\nagent in March 2003 that he knew the charges were required to be disclosed. He testified that it was\nnot until after he received the SOR that he consulted with the attorney (Tr. 66). Under the\ncircumstances presented, I am unable to apply MC \u00b6 17(d), the individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate\nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\n Applicant has not yet shown that he understands his obligation of full candor, as evidenced\nby his exchange with Department Counsel concerning his claim that he had been exonerated of any\nwrongdoing by a judicial officer at the college:\nQ And the next paragraph you indicate that the judicial officer, meaning I guess the\njudge in your case, or a magistrate or someone, did not, they realized you did not\nsteal anything and you were exonerated from any wrongdoing?\nA That was from the judicial officer at the college.\nQ At the college? So the school, why did they exonerate you from wrongdoing if you\nhad admitted stealing the chip?\nA You would have to ask the judicial officer of the college.\nQ Do you have any documents with you today to show that you were exonerated\nfrom wrongdoing on the campus?\nA No, I don\u2019t.\nQ Isn\u2019t it true that you did 40 hours of community service as a result of this, I guess\na plea bargain?\nA Yes.\nQ Was that on campus or--\nA Yes.\n(Tr. 49). In an attempt to reconcile the inconsistency between his claim of complete exoneration and\nhis 40 hours of service at the college, Applicant went on, \u201cThe college exonerated me from any\nwrongdoing but they realized that I had made a mistake and that was my, that was why I performed\nthe community service.\u201d (Tr. 50) He later explained the mistake was \u201cirresponsibly handling\ncomputer equipment, which didn\u2019t warrant any actual punishment from the college.\u201d (Tr. 55) This\n\n8\nraises doubts as to whether Applicant was completely candid during his judicial hearing at the\ncollege.   \n Whole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Each\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and\nadjudication policy. Directive \u00b6 6.3. Applicant\u2019s larceny of the computer chip raises very serious\njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability concerns (\u00b6 2(a)(1), the nature, extent, and serious of the\nconduct). While immaturity and peer influences were likely factors in his decision to steal the\ncomputer chip (\u00b6 2(a)(4), the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct), he decided\nto take the computer chip because he wanted to upgrade his computer. Self-interest was also a\nmotivation in his decisions to lie on his SF 86 and during his DSS interview, as he feared that the\nlarceny would negatively affect his internship/employment with the defense contractor. Lingering\nconcerns that he may place his personal interest ahead of his fiduciary obligations preclude me from\nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to restore his access, even though he has\napparently handled classified information without incident while he held an interim secret-level\nclearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nBrian J. Kaveney, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nIn 1982, Applicant pleaded guilty to the sale and possession of controlled substances. He\nserved about 18 months of a five-year sentence to confinement. He was on parole until 1988 when\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nhe was released from all supervision. In 2007, Applicant is now a 47-year-old husband and father\nto two adopted sons. He is a vice-president and part-owner of a successful family business, and he\nis involved in community affairs. His demonstrated ability to lead a responsible and productive life\nfor a significant period after conviction and  release from confinement is strong evidence of reform\nand rehabilitation. But because he was incarcerated for not less than one year, he is statutorily\ndisqualified from being granted a security clearance by the Defense Department unless a waiver is\ngranted. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1). \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on March\n8, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for\nthe action and alleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct due to Applicant\u2019s\ndrug-related offenses. In addition, the Guideline J matters include an allegation that Applicant is\ndisqualified, as a matter of law, from having a security clearance granted or renewed by the Defense\nDepartment under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated March 8, 2007, which is after the effective\ndate.  \nApplicant timely replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me\non April 5, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for May 3, 2007. The\nhearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript on May 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations about his drug offenses as set forth in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. Based on\nthe record evidence as a whole, I find the following facts:\n\n In addition to the drug offenses, Applicant reported two other matters. The first was a 1981 trespass offense\n3\nresulting in a dismissal. The second was a 1985 alcohol-related offense resulting in a dismissal. Because neither matters\nwere alleged in the SOR and both incidents resulted in dismissals, I have given little weight to these matters. \n3\n1.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old man who is a vice-president and part-owner (approximately 15%)\nof a successful family business. He has worked for this company since 1983. The company\nspecializes in manufacturing optical fire-control equipment and components, and it is also a\ndistributor of surveying instruments and other optical equipment. He is a vice-president of the\ncompany\u2019s real estate division, but his day-to-day duties are in the surveying division where he\nworks in sales, marketing, and management. Since he has worked in the surveying division, it has\ngrown from 10 employees and $2 million in annual sales to almost 50 employees and $25 million\nin annual sales (Exhibit E). In the real estate division, he helps manage, acquire, and control some\nof the properties the company owns. This is his initial application to obtain a security clearance from\nthe Defense Department. \n2.\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct, which he reported on his security-clearance\napplication (Exhibit 1).  By way of background, Applicant started using marijuana while a high-\n3\nschool student. While in college, his marijuana usage increased and he started using cocaine. This\nled to Applicant becoming a low-level seller. His customers were, for the most part, other college\nstudents and fraternity members.  \n3.\nIn about April 1981, Applicant sold both marijuana and cocaine to an undercover police\nofficer. He was not immediately arrested. A few months later in August, his room at the fraternity\nhouse was searched by police. They found about 35 grams of marijuana, phenobarbital, and\ndiazepam. Applicant did not have a prescription for phenobarbital and diazepam as he had accepted\nthe drugs as payment-in-kind. He was charged with unlawful possession of those drugs and the\nmarijuana.\n4.\nIn February 1982, Applicant pleaded guilty to the five drug offenses involving the sale and\npossession of controlled substances (two counts of selling and three counts of possession) (Exhibit\n2). The state court sentenced him to serve five years of incarceration for each offense, to run\nconcurrently. He served about 18 months of incarceration in a combination of the state penitentiary,\nan intermediate reformatory, and a halfway house. He served about 15 months at the reformatory.\nHe was released on parole in 1983. He remained a parolee until released in 1988. \n5.\nAfter his release from incarceration, Applicant started working for the family business where\nhe has remained employed to date. Also, he transferred from his old college to a university in the city\nwhere the family business is located. He enrolled in the evening program in the college of business\nand administration (Exhibit D). He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in 1987\nand an MBA in 1990. \n6.\nHe expressed remorse for his crimes (R. 31\u201332). He\u2019s sorry for what happened, and he is not\nproud of his past actions. He has worked to atone by doing his best by focusing on what he calls his\ntwo great hobbies, work and home.  \n7.\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf (R. 95\u2013106). She met Applicant in 1986, and they\nmarried in October 1987. She learned about his drug offenses and incarceration on their second or\n\n Under Fed.R.Evid. 702, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\n4\nmay testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise. \n4\nthird date. During their nearly 20-year marriage, she has never seen any indication that Applicant was\ninvolved with illegal drugs. For the last three years, she has been a stay-at-home mother. She also\nworks part-time (about five hours weekly) as the executive director of a youth-sports program.\nPreviously, she worked in marketing and public relations. She and Applicant have two sons, ages\nthree and seven, adopted in 1999 and 2004 (See family photographs at Exhibit A). She describes\nApplicant as a wonderful father, the best father any woman could ever ask for her children. She\nbelieves Applicant is a devoted husband, very dedicated to their family. Some of her girlfriends are\nenvious of her due to his focus on family. She and Applicant are active in their community, to\ninclude various charitable activities and teaching Sunday school twice a month. In addition,\nApplicant was an Eagle Scout (Exhibit B at 1), and he and his seven-year-old son participate in Cub\nScouts (Exhibit E). \n8.\nA longtime friend also testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf (R. 107\u2013119). The friend is a former\nCPA who is now a stay-at-home parent. He has known Applicant since they attended the second\ngrade together, about 40 years in total. After Applicant\u2019s conviction and release from incarceration,\nApplicant was a changed person who was focused on getting an education and settling down. The\nfriend has seen no indication that Applicant has been involved with illegal drugs since his release\nfrom confinement. He considers Applicant a model citizen with a good moral compass. He and his\nwife chose Applicant as the godfather of their eldest son because of their high opinion of Applicant\u2019s\ncharacter. \n9.\nIn addition to the two character witnesses, a clinical psychologist testified on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf (R. 63\u201394). His qualifications in clinical psychology are superb, to include a Ph.D. in clinical\npsychology, a postdoctoral fellowship in clinical child psychology, clinical experience in mental\nhealth since 1971, and serving as an adjunct faculty member (supervisor in clinical psychology) at\na university since 1982 (Exhibit C). The witness was qualified as an expert in the field of clinical\npsychology and allowed to testify in the form of an opinion (R. 71).  \n4\n10.\nApplicant met the clinical psychologist in 1999 when Applicant was referred by his adoption\nattorney for an assessment of his current psychological status. The result of the psychological\nevaluation was a September 1999 report, which is incorporated herein as findings of fact (Exhibit\nB). In finding that Applicant was suitable to be an adoptive parent, the report concluded with the\nfollowing summary:\nThe data of this evaluation indicates that [Applicant] is a normal adult male who long\nago recovered and rehabilitated himself from serious lapses in judgment as a young\nadult. There is no sign in the present or the recent past of any psychological\nproblems, including any problems resulting from use of alcohol or other substances.\nThere appears to be a present pattern of mild, responsible alcohol use which causes\nno problems. There appears to be no use at all of illegal substances. It appears that\n[Applicant] is exactly what he claims to be, a responsible and mature adult who\nacknowledges and regrets his past mistakes, but who is long past them. No sign was\nseen in these evaluation data of any problems that would suggest that [Applicant] is\nnot highly qualified to be an adoptive parent (Exhibit B at 3).\n\n Although the clinical psychologist testified about his opinions, I formed my own independent evaluation of\n5\nApplicant\u2019s credibility and rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 03-22167 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2006) (judge\u2019s deferral to the\nexpert witness on the issue of Applicant\u2019s credibility about arrests was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law). \n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n7\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n5\nThe data included a full urine screen for drugs and alcohol that Applicant took with one day notice.\nThe test results were negative (Exhibit B at 2\u20133). \n11.\nIn his testimony, the clinical psychologist reaffirmed his conclusions and opinions stated in\nhis September 1999 report. He recalls the evaluation of Applicant because \u201cit was refreshingly\ndifferent\u201d as Applicant was completely honest about what he had done in the past (R. 72). He opined\nthat Applicant\u2019s behavior after his release from confinement was a complete turnaround compared\nwith the previous five-year period, and he described it as a \u201creversion to type\u201d (R. 77). Based on the\nfull urine screen and the other data gathered during the evaluation, he opined that the data strongly\nsupported Applicant\u2019s claim that he had been completely drug free for a long time (R. 82\u201383). Also,\nhe opined that Applicant was completely recovered and rehabilitated and had been for quite some\ntime (R. 83).    \n5\nPOLICIES\nThe Revised Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n6\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n7\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n8\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n9\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n12\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n13\n For background information on the origin of this statutory prohibition, see Attorney Sheldon  I. Cohen\u2019s\n14\npublication Loss of a Security Clearance Because of a Felony Conviction: The Effect of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the \u201cSmith\nAmendment,\u201d which can be found at www.sheldoncohen.com/publications. \n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1) (2001).\n15\n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1) (2004). \n16\n6\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n10\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.11\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n12\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n13\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nApplicability of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986\nIn addition to the typical security concern under Guideline J, the SOR alleges in subparagraph\n1.d that Applicant is statutorily ineligible for a security clearance based on a conviction and sentence\nthat resulted in him serving not less than one year in prison. The federal statute at issue is 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 986, the so-called Smith Amendment.14\nIn 2000, a federal law was enacted that prohibited the Defense Department from granting or\ncontinuing a security clearance for any applicant if that  \u201cperson has been convicted in any court of\nthe United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d  The\n15\neffect of the legislation was to disqualify a person with a conviction in state, federal, or military court\nwith a sentence imposed of more than one year regardless of the amount of time actually served, if\nany.  \n \nCongress amended parts of the law in 2004. As amended, the prohibition on granting security\nclearances to applicants who have been convicted in U.S. courts was limited or narrowed. The law\nnow disqualifies an applicant if \u201cthe person has been convicted in any court of the United States of\na crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a\nresult of that sentence for not less than one year.\u201d  The effect of the legislation is that an applicant\n16\n\n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(d) (2004).\n17\n DOHA Operating Instruction No. 64, dated September 12, 2006. \n18\n OI 64, \u00b6 2.e. \n19\n OI 64, \u00b6 3.f. \n20\n7\nwho has been sentenced to more than one year, but instead served probation, or who served less than\na year of incarceration, is now eligible to hold a security clearance. \nThe law also authorizes a waiver in a meritorious case if there are mitigating factors. A\nwaiver of the prohibition is permitted for two of the four types of cases covered by the Smith\nAmendment: (1) where, as here, a person has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for\nmore than one year; and (2) where a person has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces\nunder dishonorable conditions.  \n17\nIn September 2006, the Director, DOHA, issued a revised operating instruction (OI) for cases\nsubject to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.  In summary, the OI implements the waiver authority granted to the\n18\nDirector by the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) in August 2006. Also, the OI addresses\nan administrative judge\u2019s responsibilities in handling a case. First, the judge is responsible for\ndeciding if the law applies to the facts of the case.  And second:\n19\nIf an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a security clearance\nsolely or in part as a result of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the Administrative Judge shall not\nopine whether a waiver of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 is merited, nor recommend whether to\nconsider the case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. However, if an Administrative\nJudge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 986, the decision shall state this fact and shall identify the specific\nsubparagraph under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c) applicable to the case.20\nAccordingly, an administrative judge\u2019s role or authority is limited to determining if the law applies\nto an applicant. If it does, no waiver recommendation of any kind will be made. \nHere, the government seeks to disqualify Applicant asserting he served about 18 months of\nconfinement. Applicant concedes the Smith Amendment applies to his case (R. 21). And the record\nevidence supports that concession. He pleaded guilty to five drug offenses, and the court sentenced\nhim to serve five years of incarceration for each offense, to run concurrently. He served about 18\nmonths of incarceration during 1982\u20131983 in a combination of the state penitentiary, an intermediate\nreformatory, and a halfway house. He served most of his sentence, about 15 months, at the\nreformatory. Therefore, I conclude that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1) applies here because the available,\nreliable evidence  establishes that Applicant was incarcerated for not less than one year. Accordingly,\nthe Defense Department may not grant (or renew) a security clearance for Applicant without a\nwaiver.\n2.\nThe Criminal Conduct Security Concern \n\n8\nUnder Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because criminal activity creates\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised under Guideline\nJ. The record evidence shows Applicant has a history of drug-related criminal conduct as a user of\nboth marijuana and cocaine and a low-level seller of the same substances. His criminal conduct\nculminated with his guilty plea in 1982,  which resulted in his incarceration for about 18 months. He\nwas on parole until 1988. His history of drug-related criminal conduct is a security concern under\nthe applicable DCs of the guideline. \nI reviewed the MCs under the guideline and conclude that Applicant receives substantial\ncredit in mitigation under two of the MCs. Both are summarized and discussed below.\nMC 1\u2014so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014applies. His drug-related criminal conduct took place\nin the early 1980s when he was a young adult attending college. He accepted responsibility for his\ncrimes by pleading guilty in 1982, he was released from incarceration in 1983, and he completed\nparole in 1988. Approximately 25 years have past since he was involved with illegal drugs. Given\nthe passage of time, his drug-related criminal conduct is not recent and it no longer casts doubt on\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nMC 4\u2014there is evidence of successful rehabilitation\u2014applies. There is clear evidence of\nsuccessful reform and rehabilitation based on the following: (1) his expression of remorse and desire\nto atone; (2) the passage of time since his release from incarceration without recurrence of drug-\nrelated criminal activity; (3) his efforts to improve himself by earning a bachelor\u2019s degree and an\nMBA; (4) his favorable employment record; (5) his mature and stable family life as a husband of\nnearly 20 years and a father to two adopted sons; (6) his involvement in community activities, to\ninclude scouting and teaching Sunday school; and (7) the opinions of the clinical psychologist who\nopined that Applicant was completely recovered and rehabilitated and has been so for quite some\ntime. Taken together, these circumstances are strong evidence of reform and rehabilitation.\n3.\nThe Whole-Person Concept\nI have also considered Applicant\u2019s case in light of the whole-person concept. In making this\nassessment, four matters are noteworthy.\nFirst, illegal drugs, the source of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, are no longer a part of his life.\nHe has had no involvement with illegal drugs since his arrest in 1981. His drug-free lifestyle was\nverified in 1999 when he was underwent a full urine screen for drugs and alcohol as part of the\npsychological evaluation. \nSecond, since his release from incarceration in 1983, Applicant has carved a new path and\nmade a new life for himself. He did it the old-fashioned way: higher education and hard work. He\nis now a successful businessman who is involved in his community. \n\n9\nThird, Applicant is now a 47-year-old family man. Married nearly 20 years, he and his wife\nare raising two adopted sons. Unlike the early 1980s, Applicant now has substantial responsibilities\nat home, at work, and in the community. \nFourth, the totality of Applicant\u2019s life circumstances is proof of a well-established track\nrecord of responsible, reliable, and trustworthy behavior. His track record as husband and father,\na successful businessman, and a law-abiding citizen for many years is persuasive evidence that the\nlikelihood of additional drug-related criminal conduct is remote if not nil. What stands out here is\nthat both his personal and professional lives are profoundly different from his life in the early 1980s\nwhen he was a college student involved with drugs. His demonstrated ability to lead a responsible\nand productive life for a significant period after conviction in 1982 and release from confinement\nin 1983 is strong evidence of reform and rehabilitation. This is a key factor, and it is deserving of\nsubstantial weight. \nViewing the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant presented sufficient evidence\nto explain, extenuate, or mitigate the criminal conduct security concern under subparagraphs 1.a \u20131.c\nof the SOR. Based on this record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s current suitability for access\nto classified information. But based on serving approximately 18 months of incarceration, he is\ndisqualified from having a security clearance granted (or renewed) by the Defense Department under\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1). Therefore, this case is decided against Applicant based solely on the Smith\nAmendment. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a - c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance is denied solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1). \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Sullivan, III, Esquire\nNovember 24, 2008\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September 8,\n2006 (Government Exhibit 1).  On January 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines F and E concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on February 16, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on March 20, 2008.  I received the case assignment on March 25, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 9, 2008, setting the hearing for May 20, 2008.\nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested a continuance due to the fact that he would be on active\n\n2\nduty with the United States Armed Forces on that date.  The request was granted and a\nnew notice of hearing was issued on June 11, 2008.  I convened the hearing as\nrescheduled on June 30, 2008.  The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 9, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\ncalled one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I, without objection.\nThe Applicant requested that the record remain open, and he submitted one post\nhearing exhibit (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J) on July 18, 2008, without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing on July 11, 2008.  The record closed on July 18,\n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 50 and retired from the United States Armed Forces as a senior\nnon-commissioned officer.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineering\nTechnician and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges under this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to obtain funds.  The Applicant admits all of the allegations under this\nguideline.  \nThe Applicant submits that the majority of his financial problems began after he\nretired from the military in 1996.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 16.)  There were\nseveral deaths on both sides of his family.  These necessitated travel to a State in\nanother part of the country.  In addition, both of his children were attending college.  His\nson also had two serious automobile accidents, with the attendant expenses.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 3.)  The end result was that by 2001 the Applicant was\nseriously in debt.  (Transcript at 37-41.)  \n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Crescent/Providian in the\namount of at least $11,900.00.  The Applicant is currently making payments on this debt\nof $150.00 a month, as agreed to by the creditor.  The Applicant submitted evidence\nshowing he has been making these payments since at least February 2008. (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit D.)  He intends to increase his payments to this creditor in the near future.\n(Transcript at 42, 56, 74.)  \n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits that he was indebted to a creditor in the amount of\n$79.00.  The Applicant stated that this account is current, and he submitted a wire\ntransfer receipt in the amount of $199.02.  (Transcript at 42-43; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E,\nand J at 5.)  The Government\u2019s most recent credit report dated June 26, 2008, confirms\nthat this payment was made and that the Applicant is current on this debt.  (Government\nExhibit 9 at 2.)\n\n3\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that he was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of at least $2,378.00.  The Applicant made a payment arrangement with this\ncreditor to pay $1,850.00 on this debt, and he has been paying $462.50 since April\n2008.  He has successfully paid off this creditor with his payment of July 18, 2008.\n(Transcript at 43-44, 74; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, F, and J at 3.)  \n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted on his Military Star account in the\namount of at least $20,435.56.  The Applicant has made no direct payments on this\ndebt for several years.  He indicated some confusion about the amount owed, believing\nit should be about $5,000.00.  However, his own sworn statement of May 2, 2002,\nindicates that he owed at least $13,500.00 to the Exchange system, which became the\nMilitary Star system.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 3.)  The Applicant\u2019s retirement pay is\nbeing attached in the amount of $164.25 a month to begin repayments on this debt.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  After deductions for interest and fees, his balance is reduced by\nabout $5.00 each month.  He is not currently making direct payments on this account,\nbut intends to begin doing do in the near future.  (Transcript at 44, 54-56.)  \n1.e.  The Applicant admits that he was indebted to a storage company in the\namount of $143.00.  The Applicant stated that this account is current, and he submitted\na receipt showing this payment was made in February 2008.  (Transcript at 44;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)  The Government\u2019s most recent credit report dated June 26,\n2008, confirms that this payment was made and that the Applicant is current on this\ndebt.  (Government Exhibit 9 at 1.)\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Government during the\nclearance screening process.  The Applicant has denied both allegations under this\nguideline.\n2.a.  Documentary evidence in the record shows that the Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance eligibility was denied in January 2004.  The reason for this action was the\nApplicant\u2019s failure to return financial interrogatories to the Government.  (Government\nExhibits 3 and 4.)\nThe Applicant filled out a security clearance questionnaire on September 8,\n2006, in which he gave the false answer \u201cNo\u201d to question 26.b., which asks:\nTo your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access\nauthorization denied, suspended or revoked, or have you ever been\ndebarred from government employment?  If \u201cYes\u201d give date of action and\nagency.  Note: An administrative downgrade or termination of a security\nclearance is not a revocation.\nThe Applicant denies falsifying this answer, stating that he had no knowledge his\nclearance authorization had been revoked.  In addition, the Applicant testified that he\n\n4\nhad returned to the Government every form he had been asked to fill out through the\nyears.  Finally, the Applicant completely denied any intent to deceive the Government\nconcerning this fact.  (Transcript at 58-60, 68-71, 78-80.)\n2.b.  The Government alleges in this subparagraph that the Applicant falsified a\nsecurity clearance application dated November 26, 2001.  The Applicant denied this\nallegation and the Government failed to produce the questionnaire.  In addition, the\nApplicant did not have any independent knowledge of his filling out this questionnaire.\n(Transcript at 71.)  The Government failed to prove this subparagraph, and it is found\nfor the Applicant.\nMitigation\nThe Applicant\u2019s supervisor testified.  This witness is also a commanding officer in\nthe Reserves.  He has known the Applicant since 2006 and described him as a person\nwho is of good character, trustworthy and a model employee.  The witness did not\nbelieve the Applicant to be any kind of a security risk.  (Transcript at 23-30.) \nThe Applicant also submitted a packet of character reference letters.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B.)  His children describe the Applicant as a loving and helpful father.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 3 and 8.)  Co-workers and military colleagues describe him as\n\u201cperson with good moral values,\u201d \u201ca dedicated, faithful to his word truthful person,\u201d and a\nperson with \u201cintegrity.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 1, 2, and 5.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n5\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG &18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG &19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG &19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant has over $30,000.00 in past due debts, which have\n\n6\nbeen due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b620(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily before 2001.  However, the Applicant made no\nattempt to even begin to try to pay these debts voluntarily until just this year.  This\nmitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nThe Applicant has just begun the task of paying off his two largest debts.  As\nstated above, currently the Military Star debt is only being paid down at the rate of $5.00\na month.  He will increase his payments to both this creditor and Crescent/Providian in\nthe near future.  While that will be a good start, he has no track record of paying his past\ndue debts over an extended period.  Under the particular facts of this case, I cannot find\nthat the Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.  Accordingly,\nAG \u00b620(d) is not applicable.  For all the foregoing reasons, Paragraph 1 is found against\nthe Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nI have carefully considered the available evidence concerning whether the\nApplicant falsified his 2006 questionnaire.  Specifically, whether he had previously had\nhis clearance access revoked.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  The Applicant\u2019s witness, co-\nworkers, and his children, describe him as a truthful man.  His testimony was candid,\neven if somewhat confusing.  He was adamant that he returned the forms presented to\nhim by the Government and, furthermore, that he never received the document\nindicating that his clearance had been revoked.  I find his testimonial evidence on this\npoint to be credible and believable, based on my analysis of him.   Accordingly, using all\nthe available evidence, I cannot find that the Applicant intentionally falsified his security\nclearance on this point.  Subparagraph 2.a. is found for the Applicant.  As previously\nstated subparagraph 2.b. is found for the Applicant.  Accordingly, Paragraph 2 is found\nfor the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n7\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nhighly respected, professional person who has made poor decisions concerning his\ndebts.  The Applicant has just begun to successfully work out his debts.\nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all the Applicant\u2019s debts are paid - it is\nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance.  Under AG \u00b62(a)(3), this conduct is recent.  Given the Applicant\u2019s complete\nfailure to begin to resolve these debts until this year, I cannot find that there have been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b62(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I\ncannot find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress (AG \u00b62(a)8)); or that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  If the Applicant shows over a longer period of time that he has truly\ntaken control of his finances, he may well be eligible for a clearance.  He is not eligible\nnow.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  As\nstated above, Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He does not believe he can be blackmailed about the offense since\nhis family, the people that mean the most to him, know of the incident.\u201d  Decision at 3.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \n\n3\nDepartment Counsel does not challenge the Judge\u2019s findings, adopting them for purposes of\nhis brief on appeal.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s findings are not at issue in this case, and we rely upon\nthem in deciding the issues raised by Department Counsel.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11765 at 3 (App.\nBd. Apr. 11, 2005).   \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d  Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \n Regarding the first issue, the Judge apparently concluded that PCMC 5 had some pertinence\nto Applicant\u2019s case, insofar as those closest to him are aware of the underlying misconduct for which\nhe was convicted, thereby reducing his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress on that\naccount.  Decision at 5.  However, the Judge explicitly stated that no mitigating conditions per se\nwould excuse Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance questionnaire.  Decision at 6.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge sought to clear Applicant on the basis of PCMC 5,\ntherefore, appears to rest upon a misreading of the Judge\u2019s decision.  We resolve the first issue\nadversely to the Government.  \nThe crucial issue in this case is the second one on appeal, whether the Judge\u2019s whole person\nanalysis is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  We acknowledge that the circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s single arrest were not of sufficient security concern to serve as an independent basis for\n\nConcerning Guideline G, the incident was not part of a pattern.  See Directive \u00b6  E2A7.1.3.1.   It occurred a\n2\nnumber of years prior to the issuances of the SOR.  See Directive \u00b6  E2.A7.1.3.2.  Applicant\u2019s subsequent behavior with\nalcohol indicates rehabilitation.  See Directive \u00b6  E2.A7.1.3.3.   As regards Guideline J, it was neither a \u201csingle serious\ncrime\u201d nor were there \u201cmultiple lesser offenses.\u201d  See Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.2.  There was no pattern of criminal\nactivity.  See Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.1.  The offense was an isolated incident that was not recent.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE2.A10.1.3.1 and E2.A10.1.3.2.\nQuestion by Department Counsel: So you understand the concern that . . . if you\u2019re not answering questions\n3\ntruthfully on . . . the security clearance application and you become involved in a mishandling of classified information,\nthere\u2019s a need to go and report that, although that could be embarrassing?\nApplicant: Yes, I understand.\nQuestion: . . . what can you tell the Judge that would lead him to conclude that you could properly handle that,\nin spite of the fact that you falsified your security clearance application?\nApplicant: . . . I\u2019ve learned a lot . . . about this process, and I\u2019ve also learned a lot about the seriousness of the\nwhole Defense effort.  Not to make light, but I did work in the commercial steel industry, which is totally different . .\n. [a]nd having jumped immediately into a Defense position . . . I understand the seriousness and I would fully . . . divulge\nany information in the future that\u2019s required.  Tr. at 17-18.  \nApplicant: \u201cI looked at [the question] and I went, \u201cOh.  Uh, gee.  I\u2019d better say no, because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll - you\n4\nknow - I\u2019ll lose my job or I won\u2019t get a security clearance.\u2019\u201d Tr. at 22.\n4\ndenying Applicant a clearance under Guidelines G or J.   We also acknowledge Applicant\u2019s\n2\ntestimony that he would divulge any required information in the future.    \n3\nOn the other hand, the Board notes the paucity of record evidence in this case, especially in\nsupport of Applicant\u2019s position.  His presentation consists principally of promises of future good\nconduct, which  are less probative than actual record evidence.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 02-29884\nat 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 16, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-31872 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2005); ISCR Case\nNo. 03-14542 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02097 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 17,\n2005); ISCR Case No. 02-24743 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2004).  In this case the Judge\u2019s sustainable\nfindings and the relatively slender record establish that Applicant was a person of mature years at\nthe time of the falsification; he committed the falsification relatively recently with respect to his\ncurrent SCA; and the falsification was for the purposes of protecting his job and obtaining a\nclearance.   The Judge himself concluded that Applicant\u2019s falsification was done \u201cwith an intent to\n4\ndeceive\u201d and  characterized it as \u201cegregious and serious.\u201d  Decision at 5-6.  Given this record\nevidence, and weighing that evidence against Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated promise of future good\nbehavior, the record does not support the conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion\nthat it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d for him to have a security\nclearance.  Egan, 484 U.S. at 528.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael D.

Two have been\nsettled. The remaining nine have not been paid nor a repayment plan established. The record\nevidence is insufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from\nher unpaid debts.

The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted or continued\ndue to Financial Considerations security concerns.\nOn September 13, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On\nSeptember 27, 2006, Applicant requested not to have a hearing and chose to have the decision made\nbased upon the paperwork previously submitted. (Item 4)  On March 16, 2007, Applicant received\nthe File of Relevant Material (FORM) dated March 5, 2007.  Applicant was informed she had 30\ndays to respond to the FORM and supply additional information.  A response was due on April 15,\n2007.  No response was received.  On May 2, 2007, I was assigned the case.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for Financial Considerations. Applicant admitted being\nindebted on 11 debts totaling approximately $14,000. This admission is incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 45 years old, has worked for a defense contractor since 2002, and is seeking to\nobtain a security clearance. From March 1980 until March 2000, Applicant was in the United States\nAir Force, achieving the grade of Technical Sergeant (E-6). \nIn 2004, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86.\n(Item 5)  In response to question 38, concerning her financial delinquencies greater than180 days,\nshe listed six debts, which totaled approximately $16,000. In March 2006, in response to\ninterrogatories (Item 6), Applicant indicated she had paid a department store bill (SOR paragraph\n1.f).  She indicated she had $2,831 in net monthly income, $1,925 in monthly expenses, and $275\nin monthly debts, which left a monthly net remainder of $630.\nApplicant\u2019s August 2006 credit report (Item 3) indicates the SOR paragraph 1.f debt was\nlegally paid in full for less than full balance. Her February 2007 credit report (Item 9) indicates\nsettlement was accepted on this account.  The February 2007 credit report also states settlement was\naccepted on the SOR paragraph 1.e debt.  There is no evidence that the remaining nine debts have\nbeen paid.\nApplicant\u2019s outstanding obligations are reflected in her credit reports dated: December 2004\n(Item 7), May 2006 (item 8), September 2006 (Item 3), and February 2007 (Item 9).  Some of the\ndebts are reflected in her June 2004 SF 86 (Item 5). \n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n3\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F, Financial Considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is\n\n4\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her\nfinances so as to meet her financial obligations.\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nThe Applicant admitted owing 11 past due debts totaling approximately$14,000.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1 A history of not meeting financial obligations) and\n3 (E2.A6.1.2.3 Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports indicate settlement has been reached with her creditors as to the\ndebts listed in SOR paragraph 1.e and 1.f.  Mitigating Condition (MC) 6 (E2.A6.1.2.6 The individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies to these\ntwo debts. I find for Applicant as to these two debts. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to the remaining nine debts.  MC 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1 The\nbehavior was not recent) does not apply.  Even though the initial debts were incurred some time ago,\nthe debts remain unpaid, and therefore the conduct is considered recent.  MC 2 (E2.A6.1.2.2 It was\nan isolated incident) does not apply because there are nine debts that remain unpaid. There was no\nshowing the debts were caused by factors beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Therefore, MC3  (E2.A6.1.3.3\nThe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation)) does not apply.  MC4 (E2.A6.1.3.4 The person has received or is receiving counseling\nfor the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol) does not apply because there has been no showing Applicant has received financial\ncounseling nor is there any indication her financial difficulties are under control. \nFor MC 6 to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and\nevidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling her debts is\nneeded, which is not present here except for the two previously listed debts. Because the debts\nremain unpaid and none of the mitigating conditions apply, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concern based on financial considerations. \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. \nThe awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on\ncurrent disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Although the evidence of mitigating and\n\n5\nrehabilitation is insufficient at this time the decision not to award a security clearance should not be\nconstrued as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of true reform and\nrehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a DoD security clearance. Should Applicant be\nafforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future and she were to arrange\nsatisfactory repayment plans with her creditors to repay her delinquent accounts, or pay her debts,\nshe may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of security worthiness. But that time has not yet\narrived. Because the Applicant meets the disqualifying conditions and none of the mitigating\nconditions as to the remaining nine debts, the Financial Considerations security concern is resolved\nagainst the Applicant. A clearance at this time is not warranted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nClaude R.

Reish, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 24, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On October 31, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Christopher\nGraham granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by\nrelying on outdated policy guidance in reaching his decision; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings:  Applicant used marijuana with varying\nfrequency between 1994 and 2004.  He has also abused Ritalin and Percocet, twice used cocaine, and\nhas used hashish.  Additionally, he has used ecstasy twice and psilocybin (mushrooms) and/or LSD\nat least five times.  \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse occurred most frequently while he was in high school and college.\nAfter graduating, he used only marijuana.  He used drugs in social settings, was never impaired by\ndrugs for the performance of his work duties, and has used no drugs at all since August 2004.\nApplicant was promoted at work.  He credited that promotion, and the responsibilities it entailed,\nwith the decision to stop using drugs.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\nDecision at 5. \n1\nApplicant cites to the Adjudicative Desk Reference, Supplemental Information, found at \n2\nwww.smdc.army.mil.\n This document was prepared by the Defense Personnel Security Research Center in Monterey CA.  \nSee the introductory comments to the ADR: \u201c[T]he Supplemental Information is not U.S. policy and may not\n3\nbe cited as authority for denial or suspension of access.\u201d  \n3\nIn analyzing Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge quoted a 1992 Department of Defense PERSEREC\nreport related to revising the adjudicative guidelines for alcohol abuse, drug abuse and\nmental/emotional disorders:  \nConsider a person drug-free for at least two years, marijuana was used regularly, or\nany other drug was used occasionally, and there are no aggravating circumstances.\nThere was no evidence of psychological or physical dependence at the time subject\nwas using drugs, and subject has demonstrated a stable life style with satisfactory\nemployment record since then.1\nThe Judge went on to observe, \u201cApplicant fits this profile.  Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana fell\nbetween occasional and frequent use.  All other drugs were experimental use.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel argues on appeal that the Judge\u2019s use of the above referenced criteria,\nsua sponte, was error.  Also,  \u201cthe 1992 material upon which the Administrative Judge\u2019s analysis\nrelied was outdated and irrelevant to the case at hand because it addressed the highly specific\ndefinitions that were contained in a set of adjudicative guidelines that are no longer in effect.\u201d \nApplicant replies that Department Counsel has not established that the criteria quoted above are in\nfact outdated.  Applicant further argues that, in any event, it was not error for the Judge to rely on\nthose criteria, since they are readily available under the auspices of the U.S. Army.2\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s position is correct.  The specific criteria which the Judge utilized in\nevaluating the recency of Applicant\u2019s drug use were set forth in guidelines no longer in force.  Under\npolicy in effect at the time Applicant\u2019s SOR was issued,  Judges are not to apply rigid time standards\nbut rather are to \u201cevaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to\nthe recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case  No. 03-02374 (App. Bd. Jan. 26,\n2006).  It is axiomatic that \u201ca Judge cannot rely on . . . an earlier version of the Directive to justify\nthe Judge\u2019s decision and that an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility must be adjudicated under\ncurrent DoD policies and standards, not past ones.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-17369 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May\n23, 2006).  The fact that the these criteria are still available on line in the Supplemental Information\nto the Adjudicative Desk Reference is of no consequence, since that publication is not U.S. policy\nand is not a legal basis for evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a clearance.   We conclude that,\n3\nin light of the Judge\u2019s use of outdated criteria, the case should be remanded to him for a new\ndecision which relies explicitly on those guidelines current at the time Applicant\u2019s SOR was issued.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a clearance is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Notice of\nHearing was dated August 25, 2006.  I convened a hearing on September 19, 2006, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The government offered one exhibit, Applicant offered six exhibits, and all exhibits were\nadmitted without objection.

Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\n30\napproved medical direction.\nISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 11 2006) (Judge did not err by concluding drug use not\n31\nrecent with passage of slightly less than two and a half years between last use and hearing) (citing ISCR Case No.\n02-10454 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2004)).  See ISCR Case No. 98-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 1, 1999) (not error for\nJudge to find that last marijuana use nine months before close of record was not recent).\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n32\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established its case under Guideline H.  Drug Involvement Disqualifying\nCondition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (Any drug abuse)  and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (Illegal drug\n30\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution) are\napplicable, because Applicant admitted drug use, possession, and purchase. \nDrug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1. (The drug involvement was\nnot recent) applies.  Applicant has been drug free for over two years.  The Directive does not define\n\u201crecent.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 9 (App. Bd.  Oct. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board:\ndeclined to set any \"bright-line\" rule as to what constitutes \"recent\" under the\nDirective regarding illegal drug use.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-10454 (November\n23, 2004) at p. 4.  The Board has indicated the matter requires an Administrative\nJudge to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion\nas to the recency of an applicant's conduct.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22173 (May\n26, 2004) at p. 4.  The application of a mitigating condition like Guideline H\nMitigating Condition 1 can depend upon a number of factors in addition to the simple\npassage of time.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0611 (November 1, 1999) at p. 2.  The\ninterval of time presented in this case, slightly less than two and a half years, must\nbe evaluated in light of other factors in the case.31\nMost of Applicant\u2019s 10-year drug usage occurred while he was in school.  He has been drug-free for\nnearly two and one-half years.  His lifestyle has changed.  He is now a family man.  And he has been\ngiven significant responsibilities by his employer.  All of these factors work together to convince me\nto conclude that his drug use is not recent.\nAlso relevant is DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3. (A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture).  Applicant stated his intent not to use drugs in the future, and has demonstrated it for over\ntwo years.  He has made the changes necessary in his life to mitigate his prior drug involvement.  I\nconclude guideline H for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n32\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\n\nId.\n33\nId.\n34\nId.\n35\n7\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the\n33\nadjudicative process factors listed in the directive.34\n  In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I  considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I\n35\nconsidered his age (26), his education which includes two majors, his employment, and what might\nmotivate him to stop his drug abuse.  Candor with the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the\ncrux of a trustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse information about himself,\nhe may be trusted with confidential or classified information.  This case speaks volumes about the\nhonesty and integrity of the Applicant, which seems to be a non sequitur.  The government is\nsuggesting that Applicant is a druggie, that he is irresponsible, reckless, and untrustworthy.  Yet, the\nreason for the hearing was because he was honest and demonstrated integrity.  Applicant was\ncompletely truthful about his drug use, disclosing it on his security clearance application, admitting\nhis usage in his answer to the SOR, and in his testimony. \nThe illegal use of drugs raises questions regarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to\nprotect classified information.  Moreover, impaired ability while under the influence of illegal drugs\nincreases the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified material.  His drug use extended over\na ten-year period, most of this time he was in high school or college.  Applicant\u2019s motivation to use\ndrugs was peer pressure and a desire to be sociable.  In the last three years, Applicant has made\nsignificant changes in his life.  He married in 2003.  He discontinued use of marijuana in 2004.  He\nbought a car and a home.  He received a major promotion from his employer, one that carries with\nit increased responsibility for himself and other employees, and compensation.  Applicant is now 26\nand is a more mature decision-maker.  He stated an intent not to use drugs in the future. \nI have carefully weighed the mitigating factors, the totality of the circumstances surrounding\nhis decision to smoke marijuana until 2004, his honesty in revealing this information, his work ethic,\nhis recent conduct, and his change in attitude against the seriousness of his misconduct.  I have\nconcluded that he would not act in a manner which would harm the government.  There is little\nlikelihood he could be pressured, coerced, exploited, or subjected to duress for his past conduct.  I\nobserved Applicant during the hearing, and especially during his testimony.  I find his testimony to\nbe believable and find him to be a sincere and credible witness, because he answered questions\ndirectly, completely, and honestly.  I believe Applicant will remain drug free in the future.  I,\ntherefore, have no reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's willingness and ability to\nprotect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected\nof one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nOn remand, in light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I find again\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nChristopher Graham\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ntrustworthiness determination under Guidelines F and E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination should be reversed\nbecause he has taken reasonable steps to resolved his outstanding debts.   He also argues that there\n1\nis no connection between his prior financial problems and his ability to perform his job and protect\nsensitive information.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative\ntrustworthiness implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The\nDirective's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which\nare of trustworthiness concern to the government and mandate a whole person analysis to determine\nan applicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (June 4, 2004).\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the financial considerations and personal conduct allegations had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years and had deliberately failed to disclose adverse information about\nhis indebtedness on his Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF-85P).  At the date of the hearing\n\n3\nhe still had significant outstanding debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  The favorable record evidence cited\nby Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  The Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  He reasonably\nexplained why the evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome  the\ngovernment\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the\nrecord that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under\nGuidelines F and E is sustainable.  Thus, the Judge did not err in denying Applicant a trustworthiness\ndesignation.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

He earned one year of college credits approximately 20 years ago. From 1976 through his retirement in 2002, he served in the Air Force, the Air National Guard, and the Army National Guard. While in the armed services, he earned several awards including the Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year for his state.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nLeonard Morales, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nSince 2005, approximately $16,600 of disputed, delinquent debt has appeared on Applicant\u2019s\ncredit reports. In January 2007, after his efforts at resolving the disputes were unsuccessful, he\nretained an attorney to help him. Since then, nearly half of the disputed delinquencies have been\ndeleted from his credit report, and he is continuing to work with his attorney to resolve the\nremainder. He has mitigated the security concerns. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn June 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was unable to conclude it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as\namended. He answered the SOR on July 10, 2007, denied the allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 9, 2007. On August 13, 2007, DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing scheduling it for September 11, 2007. During the hearing, I received five government\nexhibits, three Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. At Applicant\u2019s\nrequest, I left the record open through October 2, 2007 to allow him to submit additional documents.\nHe then submitted eight additional exhibits that I incorporated into the record. DOHA received the\ntranscript on September 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 53-year-old married man with two children, ages 16 and eight, and one adult\nstepdaughter. He earned one year of college credits approximately 20 years ago. From 1976 through\nhis retirement in 2002, he served in the Air Force, the Air National Guard, and the Army National\nGuard. While in the armed services, he earned several awards including the Non-Commissioned\nOfficer of the Year for his state. (Tr. 63)\nApplicant is a heating, ventilation and air conditioning control technician. (Tr. 38) He has\nworked in this field for nearly 30 years. Since retiring from the armed services, he has been working\nfor a defense contractor who installs ventilation systems in embassies and in military facilities in war\nzones. (Tr. 41) A former supervisor who testified at the hearing characterized him as an excellent\nemployee. (Tr. 33) \nIn October 2005, Applicant met with a security clearance investigator who informed him that\nhe had several delinquencies on his credit report. (Tr. 61) Shortly after the meeting, Applicant\nobtained his credit report. Upon reviewing it, he noticed the delinquencies, but did not recognize any\nof them. (Id.) He then wrote letters to the credit bureaus disputing them. (Id.) The credit bureaus did\nnot respond to his correspondence.\nIn January 2007, Applicant retained an attorney who specializes in credit discrepancies. (Id.)\nThrough his attorney, he pulled credit reports for his entire family. After comparing them, he noticed\nseveral discrepancies, including addresses where he had never lived, and reports identifying people\nwho shared his first name, but had different surnames. (Tr. 49)\nBy July 2007, Applicant\u2019s attorney had successfully disputed the debts listed in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.c through 1.d, 1.f through 1.g, and 1.k through 1.j. (Exhibit A) They have been\ndeleted from his credit bureau reports. The attorney is continuing to work toward getting the\nremainder stricken from his credit record. Also, the attorney is trying to get the erroneous\nbackground information removed from his credit bureau reports so the problem does not recur. (Tr.\n55)\nAs of September 10, 2007, Applicant was current on all of his undisputed debts. (see\ngenerally, Exhibit B) He pays for his stepdaughter\u2019s college tuition. Last year, he earned $144,000.\n\n3\n(Exhibit J) He has been a homeowner for more than ten years. (Tr. 67) In December 2005, he\npurchased a home. He kept his old home and rents it to tenants. (Tr. 68) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in August 2005. He did not disclose any\nof the delinquencies, as required. Before meeting with the agent in October 2005, he had never\nreviewed a credit bureau report, nor had any credit problems. (Tr. 53)\nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented by DoD\nSeptember 1, 2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d (see generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and\nSec. 4.2) In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are based on the\nevidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder the Financial Considerations guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18) Here, the\nappearance of approximately $16,600 of delinquent debt on Applicant\u2019s credit reports raises the issue\nof whether Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a) (\u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d), FC DC 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and\n\n4\nFC DC 19(e) (\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial\nanalysis),\u201d apply. \nShortly after discovering these debts were on his credit report, Applicant disputed them with\nthe credit bureau reporting agencies. When this course of action proved unsuccessful, he retained an\nattorney who systematically began investigating the disputed delinquencies, and discovered critical\nerroneous information on the credit reports including wrong addresses and names. Currently,\napproximately half of the disputed delinquencies have been resolved successfully. \nI conclude the delinquencies were attributed to Applicant erroneously. None of the\ndisqualifying conditions apply, and Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(e)\n(\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the\ncause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d), applies. Applicant has mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder the Personal Conduct guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d (AG \u00b615)\nHere, Applicant\u2019s omission of the delinquencies listed on his credit bureau report raises the issue of\nwhether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16 (a) (\u201cdeliberately providing false\nor misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel\nsecurity or trustworthiness determination\u201d), applies.\nApplicant has never had any problems paying his debts on time. Therefore, he had no reason\nto review a credit report when he executed it. Moreover, regardless of whether he knew they were\non his credit report, they were not his delinquencies. Therefore, he had no responsibility to list them\non the security clearance application. PC DC 16(a) does not apply.\nCriminal Conduct\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d\n(AG \u00b630) Applicant did not falsify his security clearance application, therefore he did not violate 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001, as alleged in the SOR. There are no criminal conduct security concerns. \nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant successfully persuaded me that the delinquencies on his credit report were\nattributed to him erroneously. In reaching this conclusion, I considered his overall financial well-\nbeing, the lack of any past financial problems, the organized manner in which he confronted the\nproblem, his credibility, and his character. Evaluating this case in light of the whole person concept,\nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the security clearance concerns. Clearance is granted.\n\n5\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.k:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He has a history of not paying his bills.  He failed to develop\nand then implement a plan to resolve them despite a promise to do so in 2004 and again in 2007. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F.

He requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. \nOn June 13, 2007, Department Counsel, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which\nwas forwarded to the Applicant on June 15, 2007.  Applicant was advised he had 30 days to respond\nto the FORM by submitting any objections or any additional information. Applicant  received the\nFORM on July 27, 2007, but sent no response to the FORM, which was due on August 26, 2007.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on September 28, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR response, Applicant admitted  to SOR allegations under Guideline F.

(Exhibits 3, 5, 6) \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position\u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n4\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. To be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an\napplicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n5\n Id.\n6\n Id.\n7\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n10\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n11\n4\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these\nadjudicative guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\n\"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n5\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\n6\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n7\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n8\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n9\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n10\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n11\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to\ngenerate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in\ntheir obligation to protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving\n\n5\nresponsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how\na person may behave in other aspects of life.\nHaving carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, I conclude that\nthe government established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations. Based on all the evidence, AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has\nmany unpaid, delinquent debts and did not demonstrate any effort to resolve them.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions (MC) but none apply sufficiently to mitigate concerns.  He\nstill carries a significant amount of outstanding delinquent debts for a variety of bills which he\nincurred over several years.  AG \u00b6 20(b)  (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)) applies in part due to his 2002 illness and medical\nbills; however, he did not explain why he has subsequently been unable to resolve these debts with\nthe $1,000 he has remaining every month after he pays his expenses. AG \u00b6 20 (a), (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) does not apply as Applicant has had several years to address these debts and has taken no\ndocumented steps. Applicant did not document he had even paid any of the small debts he\nacknowledges.   \nMost significantly, he does not meet AG \u00b6 20(c), (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control).  While promising to do so in 2004, Applicant failed to contact a credit counseling\nagency to help settle his credit problems or to challenge any of the debts listed on the credit report.\nAlso, he did not establish that he pays his current bills timely or that he has not incurred any\nsignificant new delinquent debt.  Because of these failures of proof, Applicant has not demonstrated\nhe has met AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts).  While he has a position with a modest income, he also has modest\nexpenses.  His promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations\nconcern. He entered into no payment plans with any creditor or demonstrated he had made even one\npayment. Thus, he has not established he continually and timely makes any payments.  He has\nlimited expenses, but has not allocated any of his resources to resolve this persistent issue of unpaid\ndebts.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n12\n6\nthinking, and careful analysis. Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet his financial obligations,\nand inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts raises serious trustworthiness concerns. At 42 years\nold, he is sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Given his limited income, he\nhad to make choices about how to use his limited resources. All of the SOR debts remain unpaid.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person,  I conclude he has failed to mitigate the\n12\ntrustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties for a public trust\nposition.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 22, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department\n\nDirective \u00b6  E2.A7.1.3.3.  Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.\n1\n2\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn December 29, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel has raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s\napplication both of Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (ACMC) 3  and the whole person\n1\nconcept was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse the decision of the\nJudge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nApplicant was 25 years old at the time the record closed.  He holds a B.S. degree.  He began\ndrinking while in high school and in college drank two or three times a week.  He would become\nintoxicated once or twice a week after consuming six to twelve beers.  While in college Applicant\nwas arrested and charged with underage drinking.  He was sentenced to a fine and to perform 15 to\n25 hours of community service.  He also received two years probation with a requirement not to have\nany alcohol related violations.  \nIn August 2004, Applicant was charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) after having\nconsumed between 12 and 24 cans of beer at a social function.  His breathalyzer results were .223,\nthe legal limit for alcohol being .08.  He pled guilty and was sentenced to a fine and to perform\ncommunity service.  He was required to attend a \u201csubstance abuse traffic offender program.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s dates of attendance were January through February 2005.   Additionally, he was placed\non probation for two years, which was set to expire in December 2006.  Applicant has continued\ndrinking after completion of this program.  He became intoxicated on Memorial Day 2006 and again\nthe following July, when he consumed 12 to 18 beers.  Applicant stated at the hearing that he intends\nto continue drinking but will avoid becoming intoxicated.    \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  Department Counsel challenges the\nJudge\u2019s statement, contained in the Conclusions section of her decision, that Applicant\u2019s \u201ctwo arrests\nand drinking at times to excess occurred while he was in college and shortly after he graduated.\u201d\nDecision at 5.  We will discuss this factual challenge in our analysis below. \n\nDirective  \u00b6  E2.A7.1.2.1.\n2\nDirective   E2.A7.1.2.5.\n3\nDecision at 5.\n4\nTr. at 53.\n5\n3\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raises two disqualifying conditions: \u201cAlcohol\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . or other criminal incidents\nrelated to alcohol use\u201d  and \u201cHabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\n2\njudgement.\u201d   The Judge further concluded, however, that MC 3 mitigated these security concerns.\n3\nIn support of this, she stated that much of Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems occurred in college or soon\nthereafter; that Applicant has never been diagnosed with alcohol dependence; and that he has a stable\nwork record.  She also observed that \u201cApplicant has confronted these alcohol concerns by making\na decision to curtail his drinking and not to drink anymore to the point of intoxication.\u201d   \n4\nDepartment Counsel disagrees with the Judge\u2019s analysis, arguing that it minimizes\nApplicant\u2019s more recent conduct; ignores significant record evidence such as the fact that Applicant\nwas advised to cut back on his drinking during the alcohol education program he attended; and gives\ntoo much weight to Applicant\u2019s work record, which Department Counsel argues is less relevant to\nApplicant\u2019s security concerns than his drinking history.\nWe find Department Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive.  While it is not erroneous that much\nof Applicant\u2019s drinking incidents occurred during or soon after college, it is of limited weight in light\nof record evidence that Applicant continued to drink heavily up until at least a month before the\nhearing.  Indeed, Applicant himself characterized the July 2006 incident \u201cbinge drinking.\u201d   That\n5\nApplicant continued to drink even after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s\n\n\u201cAfter he received the SOR he reevaluated his approach to alcohol and has decided to curtail his drinking . .\n6\n.  I believe he will [be] motivated to demonstrate his maturity with respect to alcohol as he has demonstrated in other\nareas of his life.\u201d  Decision at 5.  \nTr. at 52. \n7\nId.  \u201cQ: Now in December 2004, you were placed on two years of probation?  A: Yes.  Q: So, it is fair to say\n8\nthat you\u2019re still on probation now [August 16, 2006, the date of the hearing]?  A: Yes, until December.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s employer has a policy that anyone with a clearance is supposed to notify the security manager of\n9\nany incident of DWI, DUI, or a traffic fine in excess of $150.00.  One of Applicant\u2019s witnesses, a supervisor, testified\nthat this policy is not as well publicized as it should be.  Tr. at 75.  \n4\napplication of MC 3.  See ISCR Case No. 03-07874 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2005).  Indeed, the Judge\u2019s\nopinion that Applicant has made a decisive change in favor of sobriety is based for the most part on\nhis promises about the future, prompted by his receipt of the SOR.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n6\n26826 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2003)(\u201cAn applicant\u2019s stated intention about what he or she might\ndo in the future . . . is merely a statement of intention that is not entitled to much weight . . .\u201d); ISCR\nCase No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)(\u201cPromises to take actions in the future, however\nsincere, are not a substitute for a documented track record of remedial actions\u201d).    \nThe Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion is made without an adequate evidentiary basis and without\ndue consideration of the contrary record evidence.  In addition to the substantial amounts which\nApplicant drank and the legal problems arising from his alcohol abuse, there is record evidence that\nApplicant failed to curtail his drinking even after having been advised to do so by the counselor at\nhis alcohol education course,  that his incidents of binge drinking in 2006 occurred while he was\n7\nundergoing probation for DWI,  and that he failed to advise his employer of his DWI until about a\n8\nmonth prior to the hearing, which is a reflection of his judgement.   \n9\nMost significant, however, is record evidence that Applicant apparently violated the terms\nof his earlier probation following his conviction for underage drinking.  \nQ: What were the requirements of your probation for that offense?\nA: Not to get into any more alcohol trouble for the two years.\nQ: . . And what does that mean?  Not to get into more alcohol trouble?  What does\nthat mean?\nA: Driving under the influence, getting an [underage possession of alcohol], trying\nto get into a bar underage, whatever.  Anything with a Minor in Possession of\nAlcohol...\nQ: Okay.  Until you turned twenty-one, between when you were put on probation and\nuntil you turned twenty-one, did you consume any alcohol?\nA: Yes, I did.\n\nTr. at 37-8.\n10\n5\nQ: Even though you knew that was a violation of your probation?\nA: I knew I couldn\u2019t get in trouble, so I drank at home, didn\u2019t go out, but yes I did\ndrink.   \n10\nAlthough the SOR does not allege criminal conduct as a security concern, Applicant\u2019s\ncontinued underage consumption of alcohol, while on probation for a similar offense, undermines\nthe credibility of his promises for future sobriety.  Given the relevance of this testimony to the\nJudge\u2019s application of MC 3 and her whole person analysis, her failure to discuss it is clear error.\nSee ISCR Case No. 99-0018 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 1999)(\u201cA probation violation constitutes\nevidence that, as a matter of common sense, calls for explicit discussion in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\nclaims of reform and rehabilitation.  The failure of the Judge to discuss his reasoning as to the\nsignificance of Applicant\u2019s probation violation leaves the Board unable to discern whether the Judge\nengaged in reasoned decision-making when considering this aspect of the case\u201d).  \nWhile the matters cited by the Judge, such as Applicant\u2019s receipt of the SOR as constituting\na wake up call and his good work performance, are entitled to due consideration, the record as a\nwhole does not support the conclusion that they sufficiently outweigh the alcohol related criminal\noffenses, probation violation, and recent binge drinking so as to mitigate them.  Given the facts of\nthis case, the month elapsing between the Applicant\u2019s receipt of the SOR and the hearing is\ninsufficient to establish \u201ca tangible track record . . . of reform.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 94-0964 (App.\nBd. Jul. 3, 1996), citing ISCR Case No. 89-1887 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 1991)(\u201c[G]iven\napplicant\u2019s pattern of failing to file income tax returns over a period of five years, applicant\u2019s late\nfiling of those returns after receipt of SOR provides no meaningful basis to conclude applicant has\nchanged conduct sufficiently so [his] misconduct is not likely to recur\u201d).   The Judge\u2019s conclusion,\ntherefore, that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion, either as to the application of MC 3 or\nunder the whole-person concept,  is not sustainable on this record.  We conclude that her favorable\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \n\n6\n     \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 30, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was improperly denied\nadditional time to prepare his case and was granted an insufficient amount of time to submit\nadditional evidence after the hearing; whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported\nby substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nApplicant asserts that he was granted an insufficient amount of time to prepare his case for\nhearing and to submit post-hearing evidence.  Concerning preparation for the hearing, Applicant\nstates that he had very little time to prepare for the hearing owing to a personal travel schedule.  He\nalso states that he asked the Judge for more time but the Judge and Department Counsel were not\nwilling to provide him with any additional time for the preparation of his case.  Regarding the time\nallotted to submit additional evidence post-hearing, Applicant states that Department Counsel was\nadamant that he not be granted any more time beyond the time extension granted by the Judge and\nthat had he been granted additional time and submitted additional evidence, he would have been\ngranted his security clearance on the basis of that evidence alone.  The Board finds no abuse of\ndiscretion or error on the part of the Judge regarding these procedural issues. \nThe original Notice of Hearing in this case was dated November 14, 2006.  That document\ngave notice to the parties that the hearing was scheduled for December 4, 2006.  Applicant received\nthe Notice on November 21, 2006, which meant that if the hearing proceeded as scheduled, he would\nnot receive the 15 days advance notice of a hearing required by the Directive.  Initially, on November\n29, 2006, Applicant indicated to the Judge his willingness to waive the 15 day requirement and\nstated that he would \u201cprepare as well as I can with the limited time that I have limited myself to.\u201d\nOn November 30, 2006, however, the Judge learned through Department Counsel that Applicant was\nno longer willing to waive the 15 day requirement and had requested that the hearing be cancelled.\nIn light of Applicant\u2019s position, the Judge issued an Order on November 30, 2006 cancelling the\nDecember 4, 2006 hearing and rescheduling it for January 5, 2007.  On December 1, 2006, the Judge\nsent the Order by electronic message to Applicant who replied to the message by stating, \u201cThanks\nagain.  This is good enough.\u201d      \nAt the January 5, 2007 hearing, during the preliminary matters, Applicant was asked if he had\nany procedural matters to raise.  He stated that he did not.   At no time during the hearing did\n1\nApplicant suggest that he felt unprepared or that proceeding with the hearing at that time was a\nproblem for him.  There are no documents in the record reflecting Applicant\u2019s objection to\nproceeding to hearing at the appointed date and time, nor are there any indications that Applicant\nrequested more time (other than his initial objection to the December 4, 2006 hearing date) and the\nJudge was unwilling to grant his request.  Given the state of the record, Applicant raises the issue\nof lack of preparedness for the first time on appeal.  As the issue was not raised below, the Applicant\ncannot establish error on the part of the Judge.\n\nTr. at 5-10.\n2\n3\nSimilarly, the hearing transcript indicates that the Judge and the parties were in agreement\nat the start of the hearing that the Judge would leave the record open at the conclusion of the hearing\nand Applicant would have until January 26, 2007 to submit additional evidence, subject to objection\nby Department Counsel.  Nothing in the hearing transcript or the written record indicates that\nApplicant was dissatisfied with the enlargement of time the Judge granted him, or that she denied\nhim an extension of time over his objection.   Given the state of the record, Applicant is not in a\n2\nposition on appeal to complain about the Judge\u2019s actions.  Applicant, again, fails to establish error.\n     \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant did not file federal\nincome tax returns for the years 1990 through 1996 and for 1998 through at least 2004.  He did not\nask for extensions.  Applicant testified that he owed $50,000 to the IRS for taxes due from 1998 to\n2005, although after the hearing he provided a statement by an accountant to the effect that he owed\nthe IRS $39,785.  Applicant offered no explanation for his troubles with the IRS, other than that he\nhad failed to pay his taxes during a period of military deployment and \u201c[o]nce I got into that hole,\nI didn\u2019t think I was going to get out.\u201d  Decision at 3. \nIn the Conclusions section of the decision, the Judge stated that Applicant has been slow in\naddressing his tax debt, that he did not confirm that he had filed his back taxes, and that his \u201clong-\nstanding delinquent tax debts . . . have persisted without any plan for a resolution.\u201d  Furthermore,\nshe stated that \u201cApplicant has . . . provided insufficient evidence that he has a systematic plan to\nresolve the federal tax debts alleged in\u201d the SOR.

Therefore, she concluded that\nApplicant had not met his burden of persuasion for the granting of a security clearance.   \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern and conclude that they\nare supported by substantial record evidence.

Finding no error, we affirm. Applicant asserts that he was granted an insufficient amount of time to prepare his case for hearing and to submit post-hearing evidence. Concerning preparation for the hearing, Applicant states that he had very little time to prepare for the hearing owing to a personal travel schedule. He also states that he asked the Judge for more time but the Judge and Department Counsel were not willing to provide him with any additional time for the preparation of his case. Regarding the time allotted to submit additional evidence post-hearing, Applicant states that Department Counsel was adamant that he not be granted any more time beyond the time extension granted by the Judge and that had he been granted additional time and submitted additional evidence, he would have been granted his security clearance on the basis of that evidence alone. The Board finds no abuse of discretion or error on the part of the Judge regarding these procedural issues. The original Notice of Hearing in this case was dated November 14, 2006. That document gave notice to the parties that the hearing was scheduled for December 4, 2006. Applicant received the Notice on November 21, 2006, which meant that if the hearing proceeded as scheduled, he would not receive the 15 days advance notice of a hearing required by the Directive. Initially, on November 29, 2006, Applicant indicated to the Judge his willingness to waive the 15 day requirement and stated that he would \u201cprepare as well as I can with the limited time that I have limited myself to.\u201d On November 30, 2006, however, the Judge learned through Department Counsel that Applicant was no longer willing to waive the 15 day requirement and had requested that the hearing be cancelled.

(TR 3)\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant's delay in filing his federal tax returns and developing a plan to pay $40,000 in\ndelinquent federal tax debts established security concerns under both financial considerations and\npersonal conduct.  Even after receiving the Statement of Reasons (SOR), he failed to begin a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his tax debts with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Notably, he has had a\nstable and well-paying job in the private sector since 1995.  While he states an intent to resolve the\ntax debts, he has established no formal plan to do so.  Applicant did mitigate concerns over his other\ndebts which he paid and established he had no intent to falsify his security questionnaires. Overall,\nconcerns over financial issues and personal conduct persist.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on June 12, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not make\nthe preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleges specific concerns over finances\n1\n(Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations\nin an Answer notarized on August 18, 2006; he admitted all allegations with explanation except for\na denial of allegations 2.b iii., 2.b. iv.,  and 2.c.  He requested a hearing.\nProcedural Issue\nAfter Department Counsel stated the case was ready to proceed on November 2, 2006, the\ncase was assigned to me on November 7, 2006.  On November 14, 2006, DOHA issued a Notice of\nHearing and set this case to be heard on December 4, 2006, in a city near where Applicant works.\nHowever, Applicant did not receive the Notice until November 21, 2006;.  He requested the hearing\nbe re-scheduled as he did not get the 15 days advance notice required by the Directive at E3.1.8.  On\nNovember 30, 2006, I issued an Order cancelling the first date and re-schedule his hearing for Friday\nJanuary 5, 2007.  On November 30, 2006, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing cancelling the first date\nand on December 1, 2006, issued a Notice of Hearing  to re-set this case to be heard on January 5,\n2\n2007, in a city near where Applicant works.  \nDepartment Counsel presented seven exhibits (Exhibits 1-7) which were admitted into\nevidence without objection.  (TR 12-15)  Applicant testified and offered two exhibits (Exhibits A-B).\nTo allow Applicant to submit additional documents, I agreed to leave the record open until January\n26, 2007.  Department Counsel had seven days to submit his comments.  (TR 84)  After Applicant\n\n       In his response Department Counsel noted that Exhibit D indicated that the accountant had prepared tax\n3\nreturns for Applicant but did not confirm that they were filed with the IRS.  Applicant did not provide copies\nof either his federal or state returns for the 1998-2005 period over which the SOR raised security concerns.\n3\nsubmitted his Exhibits C-G, Department Counsel responded  on January 30, 2007 and offered no\n3\nobjection to the documents.   All Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted into evidence and the record\nclosed on January 30, 2007.  The transcript (TR) was received on January 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant, 51 years old, has been employed by a defense contractor as a military analyst in\nState #1 since March 1995.  In this job he is deployed all over the world.  (Exhibit 1; TR 35-36) \nHe completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on October 17, 2003. Previously, he was\nemployed from September 1993 to March 1995 with another defense contractor on the same\ncontract.   He served in the U.S. Army from 1972 to 1993 and had a Secret security clearance.  He\nwas granted a Defense Department Secret security clearance in August 1992 which he maintains.\n(Exhibit 1; TR 43)\nApplicant studied at a community college in 2001, but received no degree.  (Exhibit 1; TR\n42)  Applicant married his first wife in 1973 and divorced in 1981; they had two children and\nApplicant got custody.  He married his second wife in 1982; he was divorced in 1985 and paid her\nalimony of $1,000 per month.  He married his current and third wife in August 1985; she had two\nchildren; and they had two children together.  (Exhibits 1, 5; TR 31-32; 44-45; 65) Applicant has six\nchildren.  He is currently supporting one daughter and her three children and has been since January\n2005.  (Exhibit 5; TR 28-29; 34; 45-46)\nFinances and Personal Conduct\nIn 1993 Applicant was in the Army and supported his family on $29,000 a year.  (TR 28)\nApplicant now makes approximately $80,000 from his job and his military retirement.  His wife is\nnot currently employed.  (TR 29)\nApplicant did not file federal income tax returns from 1990 through 1996 nor did he file from\n1998 through at least 2004.  He never asked for an extension even though he knew he had a legal\nresponsibility to file his taxes.  (SOR 2.b.)  At his hearing, he could offer no explanation as to why\nhe had not filed these federal returns. He was deployed in 1991 and lived in tents for six to seven\nmonths which is why he did not file that year.  (TR 20-22; 47-48; 57)  He declared, \u201cOnce I got into\nthat hole, I didn\u2019t think I was going to get out.\u201d He now believes he can resolve these tax debts in\ntwo or three years.  (TR 35; 49-50; 75) He did contact the IRS in 1997 and again in 2000 or 2001.\nSince the garnishments ended in 2003, he has not contacted the IRS again.  (TR 58)  \nIn January 2007 he wrote a letter to IRS to try to obtain copies of his correspondence from\n\n       The SOR does not allege any security concern over his unfiled and unpaid state taxes; no SOR\n4\namendment was offered to add that as a concern.\n4\n1997 and in 2002 or 2003; however, he did not submit any response from IRS.  (Exhibit F)\nApplicant hired a law firm in November 2005 to handle his tax issues, but they required him\nto file all his taxes before they would act to arrange a payment plan with the IRS.  Consequently, he\nhired an accounting firm in December 2006 to file his taxes. In January 2007 he testified he believed\nhe owed $50,000 to the IRS for tax years 1998 to 2005.  He could not file for tax years beyond a five\nlimit; the time for him to file with IRS for 1990 to 1995 has expired.  He last filed a tax return either\nin 1996 or 1997. He admitted he also has not filed his state taxes since 1997 and estimated he owed\n$3,000 to the state.  His accounting  firm indicated in January 2007 that they had prepared the tax\nreturns for years 1998 through and including 2005. The firm reported Applicant and his wife owe\n$39,785 in federal taxes and $2,849 for state taxes  in the state where he lives and $763 for state\n4\ntaxes in another state.  (Exhibits 2, 3, 4; TR 22-23; 55-63; Exhibit D)\nApplicant signed his 2003 SF 86 and certified that the statements on the form were true and\ncorrect.  On his SF 86 Applicant was asked in Question 34 if he had any wage garnishments; he\ndisclosed that the IRS had garnished his wages in July 2001 in the amount of $53,000; he explained\nthat was an estimate.  In fact, he owed $47,000.  However, in response to Question 36 on any tax\nlien, he did not document that he had received a tax lien from the IRS in May 2002.  (SOR 2.c.)\n(Exhibit 1; TR 33-34)  In his answer he claimed he did not know he had a tax lien; at the hearing he\nsaid he was never given any written notice of the lien.  (Answer; TR 23-24, 33-34)  Investigation\ndisclosed adverse credit issues in credit reports.  (Exhibits 2, 3, 4)\nSOR 1.a..\nApplicant admitted his debt to Creditor #1, the IRS, but stated in August\n2006 that he planned to file his back taxes and to pay his tax debt.  He stated\nhe had paid over $45,000 for taxes through the year 1997, but he did not\nprovide documentation showing he had paid that amount.  He admitted owing\nfor tax years 1998 to 2005.   (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 4; TR 54-55)\nSOR 1.b.\nApplicant admitted the IRS filed a tax lien against him in May 2002 for non-\npayment of federal tax from 1990 to1995.  (Answer)\nSOR 1.c. \nApplicant admitted the IRS filed a tax lien against him in May 2002 for\n$2,430 for non-payment of federal taxes for 1996.  Those taxes were paid in\nfull and tax lien was released in August 2003.  Applicant did not learn about\nthe lien until the security investigator came to talk with him in November\n2004 or 2005 and showed him a credit report.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 4; TR 52-\n55)\nSOR 1.d. \nApplicant\u2019s wages were garnished in 2001 to  pay for delinquent federal\nincome taxes.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4)  Applicant paid some of his back\ntaxes through this wage garnishment for two years; but his wages are no\nlonger being garnished.  (TR 25, 37; 51-52) \n\n5\nSOR 1.e. \nIn October 2005 Applicant paid his debt to Creditor #2, for $588 for a credit\ncard he applied for and never used.  He has another credit card with this\ncreditor that he keeps current.  (Answer; TR 26-27; 63-64)\nEarlier, after he returned from an overseas assignment, Applicant completed his 1992\nNational Agency Questionnaire (DD Form 398-2).  In response to Question 19e. he did not reveal\nthat he had any significant delinquent debts even though he had debts of $4,000 to four creditors. At\nthat time he did not have access his credit report before he answered the questions; he did not\nintentionally falsify his answer.  While he was married to Wife #2, she incurred a lot of debts that\nshe did not disclose to him.  That behavior led to their divorce.  (SOR 2.b.) (Exhibits 4, 7; TR 41-42;\n73-74)  He disputed the first debt of $600 as not his debt as he was not able to get his car refinanced\nafter his divorce and returned the car to his wife; he was not responsible for her actions.  (Exhibit\n7; TR 30) (SOR 2.b.i.) \nWith respect to his current financial situation, Applicant stated he had six credit cards which\nhe keeps current.  His only other debt is for his mortgage.  His house is worth $167,000; and he owes\n$124,000.  He has owned the home since 1994.  He does expend monies on home remodeling. While\nhe had credit problems in the 2000 to 2001 period he resolved his debts with those creditors. (TR\n27-28, 38; 41; 70-71) He explained that the late medical bills are due to the method TRICARE uses\nto pay medical bills.  (TR 68) He has been responsible for paying the bills in the household since\n1994.  His wife is not aware of the extent of the tax issues.  (TR 66-67)  His current budget reflects\nmonthly income of $8,300, monthly expenses of $2,779, and discretionary expenses of $909.  He\nmakes a $164 investment deposit to his 401K 403B accounts.  His monthly remainder is $4,516.\n(Exhibit G)\nApplicant believes he makes an important contribution through his work.  (TR 38-39)  His\nperformance evaluation for 2006, signed in January 2007, documents that overall he meets job\nrequirements.  With respect to individual job elements, Applicant meets job requirements  in job\nknowledge, quality and quantity of work, and company values. Applicant exceeds job requirements\nin working relationships and communication skills as well as in time management and initiative.\n(Exhibit E)\nReferences\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for five years reported that he is an \u201coutstanding employee in every\nrespect.\u201d  He knows that Applicant has made a mistake, but he has confidence in him as a trainer and\nbelieves this \u201cmistake\u201d should not be compounded by denying him a security clearance.  Applicant\nhas been meticulous in complying with security requirements.  He does not believe Applicant would\ndisclose secrets even under stress or duress. (Exhibit C)\nAn individual who is a GS-14 deputy and has worked with Applicant since 1992 views\nApplicant as a professional.  He has \u201ctotal trust\u201d in Applicant as he \u201cconsistently demonstrates all\nof the traits that we stress in the Army: honesty; truthfulness, candor and integrity.\u201d  He recommends\nhim without reservation be allowed access to classified information. (Exhibit B)\nAn individual who is a GS-15 and has worked with Applicant for 14 years as a co-worker\nand as government oversight assesses him as having \u201cconsistently demonstrated an outstanding level\n\n       Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: E2.A6.1.2.1.  A\n5\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; E2.A6.1.2.2.  Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as\nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan\n6\nof professionalism.\u201d  His position \u201crequires the highest levels of integrity and honesty.\u201d  He has\n\u201ctotal trust\u201d in Applicant and recommends that he be granted a security clearance.  (Exhibit A)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual\u2019s security eligibility: conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or\ncontinue an individual's access to classified information.  The mere presence or absence of any given\nadjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole\nin evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Concern:  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Concern:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision\nto grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall\ncommon sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and\nconclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Government established disqualifying conditions  that could raise a security concern and\n5\n\nstatements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; E2.A6.1.2.4.  Unexplained affluence; E2.A6.1.2.5.  Financial problems that are linked to gambling,\ndrug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.\n       Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: E2.A6.1.3.1.  The behavior was not recent;\n6\nE2.A6.1.3.2.  It was an isolated incident;  E2.A6.1.3.3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation);  E2.A6.1.3.4.  The person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol;  E2.A6.1.3.5.  The affluence resulted from a legal source; and E2.A6.1.3.6.  The individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\nmay be disqualifying including Applicant\u2019s (1) history of financial problems and his (3) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy all of his debts.  Applicant resolved his dated debts, but he has been very\nslow to address his responsibility to file and pay his federal taxes for a number of years.  Substantial\nunresolved issues persist with the IRS.  He is not in communication with the IRS as to how to\nresolve his back taxes.  He explained his tax lawyers would not address the issue until he had filed\nall his tax returns. He retained an accountant to do so in January 2007; she confirmed that she had\nprepared the returns for 1998 to 2005, but did not confirm Applicant had filed them.  \nConsequently, Applicant does not fulfill  mitigating  conditions.  While he has developed a\n6\nplan and hired a tax lawyer in November 2005, he did not hire an accountant until January 2007 to\nprepare his returns.  While he has to travel for his job, he is responsible for managing the bills.  His\nsubstantial take home pay is approximately $8,300 per month and his monthly remainder is $4,500\nper month.  Yet, the long-standing delinquent tax debts which he acknowledged in 2003 in his SF86\nhave persisted without any plan for a resolution.  Consequently, I conclude that under MC 2, the\ndebts were not isolated as he developed multiple delinquent tax debts.  \nUnder MC 3, there initially were conditions that resulted in his not filing his IRS return in\n1991 when he was deployed and living in a tent.  However, that defense cannot obscure the many\nyears of subsequent inaction when he failed to file returns.  Further, under MC 4, Applicant delayed\nseeking financial counseling for the tax problems.  He waited until January 2007 to hire an\naccountant to prepare his taxes and gave no clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control with the IRS. Under MC 6, an individual is expected to initiate a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  To mitigate Applicant does not have to have\nerased every tax debt, but he has to present a plan.  Here Applicant has demonstrated he is financially\nresponsible in every other way, but he was failed to follow through and demonstrate a plan to resolve\nthese federal tax debts of approximately $40,000. Thus, Applicant has failed to mitigate these\nfinancial concerns as he has provided insufficient evidence that he has a systematic plan to resolve\nthe federal tax debts alleged in SOR 1.a.  Through wage garnishment he has paid the other taxes and\nanother debt alleged in SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix\n8.  It is troublesome that Applicant cannot explain his failure to file and to resolve his federal tax\n\n       Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  E2.A5.1.2.2.\n7\nThe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; E2.A5.1.2.5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations,\nincluding violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency; \n8\ndebt when he otherwise provided evidence of positive behavior on the job and improved financial\ncircumstances in his personal handling of other matters.  For example, he has otherwise no new\ndelinquent, unpaid debt. Thus, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low\nespecially in light of the total confidence his supervisors and overseers express in his competence\nand integrity.   Applicant has greater awareness of financial responsibilities in areas except for his\nfailure to take responsibility to file and pay his back federal taxes.  He has stable employment since\n1995 in a company where he is valued.  In sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low.\nHe has had a clearance for a number of years, both in military service and in his work for defense\ncontractors.  However, I find unexplainable his failure to use his substantial financial resources to\ndevelop a plan to resolve these long-standing delinquent tax debts.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated some of his debts and\npaid some of his past tax debts, but otherwise failed to mitigate the concerns pertaining to his\nremaining federal financial tax obligations.  Substantial evidence supports a conclusion that\nApplicant is not yet eligible  to retain his security clearance based on pertinent factors under the\nAdjudicative Process.  Even after receiving the June 2006 SOR, he failed to set in motion a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his tax debts and develop a plan with the IRS despite his stable and well-paying\njob.  In the light of his history of paying past taxes by wage garnishment, he has not mitigated these\nsecurity concerns simply by a stated intent to file his taxes and to resolve the tax debts without\nhaving established a formal plan. \nThus, I rule against Applicant under SOR Paragraph 1 as he failed to mitigate the allegations\nin SOR subparagraphs1.a., but has mitigated allegations in subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d, and 1.e.  \nPersonal Conduct\nThe government provided evidence to support security concerns  over personal conduct in\n7\nhis failure to file his federal income tax returns from 1990 through 1996 and from 1998 through\n2004.  On the other hand, with respect to his omissions on his two security forms regarding financial\nquestions, I conclude the government did not establish this concern as Applicant demonstrated he\nhad no intent to falsify, so his omissions were not deliberate.  Notably, Applicant disclosed\nsignificant adverse information regarding his finances in his 2003 SF 86 as he revealed $53,000 in\ntax debts in response to question 34. While he admitted he failed to disclose a tax lien in response\nto question 36, he credibly denied an intent to deceive or falsify.  His lack of intent to hide or deceive\nthe government about his financial issues is established by his having revealed the most significant\nof his debts, his federal tax delinquencies. I find him similarly credible with respect to the financial\nissues he failed to document on his 1992 security form. \n\n9\nAs discussed above under financial considerations, Applicant failed to provide sufficient\nevidence to mitigate concerns over his failure to file his federal tax returns as he understand he had\na legal duty to do so.  While he had a credible explanation for failing to file for one year, he could\nnot himself explain his failure to file in subsequent years. \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix\n8.  While Applicant\u2019s did not initially detail all of his financial problems, he has a long history of\nresponsible conduct and has had a clearance for a number of years, both in military service and in\nhis  defense contractor work.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.\nHowever, the history of other responsible conduct makes his failure to take responsibility for his\ntaxes even more inexplicable.\nConsidering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against\nApplicant under SOR paragraph 2 and subparagraph 2.a., but for Applicant on subparagraph 2.b. and\n2.c..\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make\nthe following formal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Clearance is\ndenied.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRay T. Blank, Jr., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s six arrests between 1979 and 2004 raise a security concern. He has only been\narrested once in the past 18 years. Given the positive changes in his life that have occurred during\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nTr. 47.\n2\nSee generally, Exhibits F through Q.\n3\nTr. 63.\n4\n2\nthat time, the isolation of the most recent arrest, and its surrounding circumstances, I conclude it\nrepresents an anomaly rather than a continuing pattern of criminal conduct. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  Applicant answered it on October 25,\n1\n2006, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 6, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 27, 2007, scheduling it for March 13, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the\nhearing, I received eight government exhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two\nApplicant witnesses. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open through March 27, 2007\nfor Applicant to submit additional exhibits. That day, he submitted 12 additional exhibits.\nDepartment Counsel did not object to their admissibility. I then marked them as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nF through Q, and incorporated them into the record. DOHA received the transcript on March 23,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old married man. He has been married twice in the past, and has one\nchild from a prior marriage, age 26. He earned a GED in 2001. For the past three years, he has\nworked as a maintenance supervisor tasked with troubleshooting equipment for his employer.  He\n2\nis well-respected in his community.3\nIn 1979, Applicant\u2019s then wife caught him with his paramour at a New Year\u2019s Eve party.  She\n4\nconfronted the paramour, and a fight ensued. As Applicant attempted to separate them, they both fell\nto the ground.

Applicant, Journal Entry dated June 21, 1988.\n15\n3\nApplicant, alleging that he shoved her to the ground.  Two weeks later, Applicant\u2019s wife filed assault\n5\ncharges against him arising from the same incident.6\nThe paramour\u2019s charge was dismissed after she later told the police that Applicant was\nattempting to protect her during the fracas.  Later, the wife\u2019s assault charge was dismissed after she\n7\ntold the police that her parents pressured her to file it.  \n8\nIn 1982, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DUI). He\npleaded no contest, and was sentenced to six months incarceration (suspended), one year probation,\nand fined $500. Also, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months.9\nIn 1985, after pulling a knife on an assailant during a barroom brawl, Applicant was arrested\nand charged with felonious assault and carrying a concealed weapon.  In exchange for his guilty plea\n10\non the felonious assault charge, the prosecution dropped the concealed weapon charge. He was\nsentenced to five to ten years imprisonment (suspended), ordered to serve 90 days in the local jail\non a work release program, and placed on three years probation. He was released from jail after\nserving approximately 45 days of the sentence.11\nApplicant attributes his legal problems in his youth to a problem with alcohol consumption.\nAfter serving the 1985 sentence, he voluntarily entered Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous (AA). Currently,\nhe continues to attend AA periodically.  He has not drunk any alcoholic beverages in 23 years.\n12\n13\nIn 1988, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic violence after throwing a wrench\nat his girlfriend\u2019s car window during a heated argument.  Later, the charge was dismissed after his\n14\ngirlfriend filed a statement acknowledging that she \u201cwas as much at fault\u201d as Applicant.15\n\nExhibit M, Statement of Wife, dated March 26, 2007.\n16\nId. at 1.\n17\nId.\n18\nTr. 33-Wife\u2019s testimony.\n19\nExhibit A, Statement of Wife, dated October 25, 2006, at 2.\n20\nId; Tr. 37-Wife\u2019s Testimony.\n21\nId.\n22\nTr. 35 - Wife\u2019s testimony.\n23\nExhibit 8, Warrant of Arrest and Disposition, dated December 15, 2004, at 1.\n24\nId. at 2.\n25\nExhibit Q, Anger Management Class Online Receipt, dated March 26, 2007.\n26\n4\nIn 1999, Applicant began dating his current wife.  They married in 2002. Although they\n16\nsometimes \u201cagree to disagree\u201d like most married couples, they are generally happy.  He has always\n17\ntreated her respectfully, and has never \u201claid his hands on [her] in anger.\u201d18\nIn October 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife grew seriously ill, and underwent gall bladder surgery.\nAfter her discharge from the hospital, her sister moved into their home to help her convalesce.\nOne evening, a few days after the surgery, while Applicant was at work, his wife began\nexperiencing post-surgery complications that required emergency hospitalization. By the time\nApplicant returned from work the next morning, she had been discharged from the hospital. Because\nneither she nor her sister contacted him at work to tell him of the hospitalization, he grew \u201ca little\naggravated.\u201d  His wife then apologized, and they \u201cmoved on to other topics\u201d of discussion.\n19\n20\nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law then interjected herself into their conversation, steering it back to\nthe issue of the hospitalization.  Although his wife admonished her to calm down, she grew loud\n21\nand overbearing.  In response, Applicant and his wife told her to leave their home. He then set her\n22\nluggage on the front porch. When he re-entered the house, she slapped him, whereupon he physically\nescorted her to the front door. In the course of removing her from the home, she fell to the ground.23\nAfter Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law reported the incident to the police, he was arrested and\ncharged on October 11, 2004, with misdemeanor assault and battery.   Two months later, he pleaded\n24\nno contest and was sentenced to six months in jail (suspended), and twelve months of unsupervised\nprobation.  Also, he was ordered not to have any contact with his sister-in-law during the probation.\n25\nApplicant complied with the terms of probation. He has not been arrested or charged with\nany crimes since that time, and continues not to have any contact with his sister-in-law. On March\n26, 2007, he voluntarily enrolled in an eight-hour anger management class.26\nPOLICIES\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n27\n5\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n27\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct\n\n6\nApplicant was arrested and charged six times with criminal conduct between 1979 and 2004.\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2\n(A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) apply.\nFive of the incidents occurred 18 or more years ago, and were reflective of immaturity,\nalcoholism, and troubled relationships with girlfriends/spouses. Applicant is now a mature, happily\nmarried man who has been alcohol-free for 23 years. Given that he no longer drinks alcohol, and is\nnot in a volatile relationship, it is highly unlikely that he will be involved in the type of incidents that\nprecipitated the arrests in the 1980s.\nNevertheless, the 2004 incident involving Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law revives security-\nworthiness issues related to his judgment and ability to control his temper. Both Applicant and his\nsister-in-law were apprehensive and emotionally distraught over the health concerns of his wife at\nthe time of the incident. These emotions impaired their ability to rationally resolve their\ndisagreement. Instead, it escalated, culminating in Applicant being charged with assault and battery\nfor physically removing her from the home.\nApplicant has not violated the law since 2004. Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC\nMC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was not recent) applies. Also, given Applicant\u2019s\ncommitment to marital fidelity and sobriety, in addition to the fact that he no longer has any contact\nwith his sister-in-law, I conclude CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 (The factors leading to the violation are not\nlikely to recur) applies. \nWhole Person Concept\nAll of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct with the exception of one incident in 2004 occurred\neighteen or more years ago. Also, the majority of it stemmed from immaturity, alcohol abuse, and\ntroubled relationships with spouses or girlfriends. Applicant has overcome all of these problems. The\n2004 incident, though unfortunate, is not indicative of a problem with criminality that may recur in\nthe future, given its surrounding circumstances, and the fact that he has committed no additional\ncriminal violations since that time.\nApplying the whole person concept to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s case, I conclude he is\nan industrious individual who is dedicated to his wife, contrite about his past transgressions, and\ncommitted to staying out of trouble in the future. He has mitigated the criminal conduct security\nconcern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1\u2013Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor under Guideline B.  That favorable finding is not at issue on appeal.\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 1.\n2\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 27, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 11, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the requirements of the\nMemorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and\nIntelligence, dated August 16, 2000 (ASDC3I Memo) conflict with the language found in the\nDirective; whether Applicant was denied due process; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline C is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant argues that the ASDC3I Memo requirement that \u201c. . . clearance be denied or\nrevoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains approval for its use from the\nappropriate agency of the United States Government\u201d conflicts with the language found in Directive\nGuideline C, which states only that possession and/or use of a foreign passport \u201cmay\u201d be\ndisqualifying.  This claim essentially challenges the wisdom or desirability of the guidance provided\nby the ASDC3I memo. The Board's jurisdiction and authority are limited to reviewing security\nclearance decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 - E3.1.35.\nNothing in the Directive gives the Board the jurisdiction or authority to pass judgment on the\nwisdom or desirability of guidance provided by the ASDC3I. See ISCR Case No. 99-0480 at 8 (App.\nBd. Nov. 28, 2000). Therefore, the Board does not have the jurisdiction or authority to address\nApplicant's appeal argument in this regard.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0457 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan.\n3, 2001).\n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because:\n(a) one of Applicant\u2019s witnesses was not allowed to testify that he knew of a few people who were\ngranted clearances even though they currently possessed duel citizenship; (b) the Judge did not \u201chelp\n[Applicant] fully understand why [her] witness\u2019s testimony could not be heard\u201d; (c) Applicant \u201cd[id]\nnot feel the judge or the defense lawyer truly acted in a casual manner, as [she] was led to believe\nthey would by [Department Counsel]\u201d; and (d) Applicant\u2019s \u201cignorance with the jargon involved in\n[her] case also tested the patience of the judge.\u201d   The Board construes Applicant\u2019s arguments as\n2\nraising the issue of whether she was denied due process.  However, in that regard, Applicant has not\ndemonstrated error.\nDuring direct examination, Applicant asked her witness \u201cif there are any persons . . . that\ncurrently are in a situation that I\u2019m in where they either are applying for Clearance or they have\nClearance, but they also have citizenship in foreign countries?\u201d  Department Counsel objected to the\nquestion because it \u201ccall[ed] for speculation.\u201d  The Judge sustained the objection on the basis of\n\nTranscript at 57.\n3\nTranscript at 12.\n4\n3\nrelevance and Applicant did not request any further explanation of the ruling from the Judge.   The\n3\nissue of security concern in Applicant\u2019s case was not whether she possessed foreign citizenship, but\nthe extent to which she had actually \u201cexercised\u201d foreign citizenship.  Moreover, the Board has\npreviously noted that a decision by a Judge in another case is not legally binding precedent on that\nJudge\u2019s colleagues in other cases, even if an applicant can establish close factual similarities between\nthe cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006).  The Judge was not\nlegally obligated to reconcile his decision in this case with the decisions of other Judges or\nadjudicators in ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App. Bd. July 31,\n2006).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s ruling as to the testimony in question is sustainable.\n  \n A review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth\nin Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, and that the Judge conducted the hearing in a\nprofessional manner, consistent with his role as an impartial presiding official.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. July 24, 2006).  Applicant fails to identify anything in the record below\nthat indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to question the fairness, impartiality, or\nprofessionalism of the Judge or the Department Counsel. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2\n(App. Bd. June 6, 2006).  \nApplicant was given timely notice of the hearing and had received a copy of the Directive.\nAt the beginning of the hearing, Applicant stated that she was 35-years-old and possessed a Masters\ndegree in Secondary English Education.  She also stated that she understood that she had a right to\nbring an attorney, but that she had decided to represent herself, and that she had read the\ngovernment\u2019s documents and generally understood them.  The Judge relaxed the judicial and\ntechnical rules of evidence in order to give the parties the opportunity to develop a full administrative\nrecord.   The record indicates that Applicant answered questions coherently, made an opening and\n4\nclosing statement, testified on her own behalf, called and questioned six witnesses, and offered six\ndocumentary exhibits in support of her case.  Although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act\nlike a lawyer, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the\nDirective.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take\ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that failure to act does not constitute a denial of their\nrights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).  The Board has previously\nnoted that a pro se applicant cannot complain about the quality of self-representation.  See, e.g., 03-\n04779 at 3 (July 20, 2005).\n(3) Finally, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to properly weigh the evidence in this\ncase and that his overall unfavorable decision under Guideline C is arbitrary, capricious and contrary\nto law.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that she has a proven track record, that she\nis not a threat to the United States, that she has nothing to hide, that her character has stood the test\nof time, and that she has earned the trust of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s arguments\ndo not demonstrate the Judge erred.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\n\n4\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nnature and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant under Guideline B.\nHowever, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline C.   The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines C is sustainable.  Thus, the Judge\ndid not err in denying Applicant a clearance.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett    \nJeffrey D.

In support of that argument, Applicant provides new\nevidence in the form of additional explanations and restates the facts of his case, arguing that the\nJudge misweighed the evidence, by failing to given adequate consideration to the favorable evidence.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005).\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions.  He reasonably explained why there was insufficient mitigating evidence to overcome\nthe government\u2019s other security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by the Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Again, Applicant\u2019s\nargument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question on his security clearance application.  The Judge was not bound,\nas a matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to\nfind that Applicant\u2019s omission was deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding\nof deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.

The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 3, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns\nunder Guideline J Criminal Conduct, Guideline G Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline H Drug\nInvolvement of the Directive.1\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated letter.  He admitted all but one of the\nallegations under Guideline J, and stated the allegations under Guidelines G and H were mitigated.\nHe requested a hearing before an administrative judge, and the request was received by DOHA on\nJuly 11, 2006.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on January 23, 2007, and\nthe case was assigned to me on January 29, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 9,\n2007, for a hearing on February 27, 2007.  On February 20, 2007, Applicant\u2019s counsel requested a\ndelay of the hearing.  An amended Notice of Hearing was issued on February 23, 2007, and the\nhearing convened on March 14, 2007.

He graduated from\ncollege with a degree in physics in 1986, and commenced working for a defense contractor in 1987.\n\nTr. 14-19; Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated February 17, 2004).\n3\nTr. 20.\n4\nTr. 20-21, 38.\n5\nTr. 21-22, 37-38.\n6\nTr. 22, 35-37; Government Exhibit 3 (Criminal Justice Information, undated).\n7\nTr. 22-23, 34-35; Government Exhibit 3 (Criminal Justice Information, undated).\n8\nTr. 23-28, 44-50; Government Exhibit 3 (Criminal justice Information, undated).\n9\n3\nHe worked for various defense contractors until working with his present employer.  He received his\nfirst security clearance in 1987, and has held a clearance since that time.3\nApplicant was arrested in 1980-1981 while a college student for possession of marijuana.\nApplicant and a number of friends were riding in a vehicle containing marijuana when they were \nstopped by police.  All of the occupants of the vehicle were charged with possession of the drug.\nApplicant was fined and placed on probation.4\nApplicant denied that he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in 1986.  At the time,\nApplicant was not in the area where the alleged arrested for driving while intoxicated took place.5\nApplicant admitted he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in 1987.  Applicant and\nsome fellow employees drank alcohol after work.  Applicant was stopped by police while driving\nhome.  He received a fine and probation for the offense.6\nApplicant admitted he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in 1990.  He pled guilty to\nreckless driving, fined $1,150, and placed on probation for 12 months.  He admitted the incident was\nalcohol-related.7\nApplicant admitted he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in 1996.  Applicant was\nnotified that his work with a defense contractor would not continued since the contractor had\ncompleted the project and had not received a new contract.  He and other employees drank alcohol\nafter receiving notice the project would not continue.  Applicant pled guilty to driving while\nintoxicated, fined $500, and placed on probation for 60 days.8\nApplicant admits he was arrested for possession of cocaine in 2000.  Applicant drove another\nperson to a residence for that person to purchase cocaine.  The residence was under surveillance by\npolice for drug activity.  Applicant and the other person were stopped by police after leaving the\nresidence and arrested for possession of cocaine.  The charge was dropped after Applicant completed\na drug diversion program.  Applicant admitted he used cocaine a minimum of five times between\n1999 and 2000.  He used the cocaine to enhance his ability to drink and the effect of alcohol.  \n9\nApplicant was directed to enter a drug treatment program as a condition of his drug diversion\nprogram.  He successfully participated in a two week inpatient program.  He participated in all\n\nGovernment Exhibit 4 (Clinical report, dated December 17, 2001).\n10\nApplicant Exhibit D (Certificate of completion, dated January 14, 2002).\n11\nTr. 39-44, 52-59.\n12\nApplicant Exhibit A (Employee information, various dates).\n13\nApplicant Exhibit B (Appreciation certificates, various dates).\n14\nTr. 63-68.\n15\n4\ntreatment functions, and made excellent progress towards his treatment objectives.  He accepted his\naddiction as a disease and developed a constructive recovery plan for ongoing sobriety.  He admitted\nhe had a substance abuse problem.  He was stable at discharge with a good prognosis, if he continued\nto follow his recovery plan.  He was to attend outpatient services and 12-step meetings.  The treating\nphysician diagnosis at the completion of the program was cocaine dependent.10\nApplicant admits he is an alcoholic who used cocaine occasionally to enhance his\nconsumption of alcohol.  He started drinking alcohol at age 19 when it was legal in his state.  His\nalcohol of choice is beer.  He knows that as an alcoholic he cannot drink alcohol.  He stopped\ndrinking upon entering his inpatient treatment.  He then completed an intensive outpatient treatment\nprogram in January 2002.   His last drink of alcohol was in 2003 when he was on a trip and had two\n11\ndrinks.  He realized what he was doing and called his wife for support to not drink any further.  He\nlast used cocaine in 1999 to 2000.  He last used marijuana in the early 1980s while in college.  He\nwas surprised that he was diagnosed as cocaine dependent after the inpatient treatment.  During his\ntreatment, he talked extensively about his alcohol use but there was little discussion of cocaine use.\nHe does admit to alcohol addiction, but not addiction to other substances.  Applicant attends church\nregularly.  He no longer attends organized 12 step programs because he found support from his\nchurch\u2019s religious programs.12\nApplicant has a good reputation at work.  He received annual promotions and pay raises\nduring his ten years with his present employer.   He received certificates and letters of appreciation\n13\nfrom the government commands and offices he supported.   The president of his company stated\n14\nhe has known Applicant for over ten years and knows about his problems with substance abuse.  The\npresident is the founder and owner of the company which provides technical support to government\nagencies.  He stated that Applicant is a very good worker and his performance is continuously\npraised by government representatives.  He has talked to Applicant about his substance abuse issues.\nHe and the Applicant agree that the Applicant\u2019s past substance abuse was a problem.  He has seen\na change in Applicant\u2019s behavior and knows that Applicant has straightened his life for the good.15\nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor stated he has known Applicant for the last two years.\nApplicant has an excellent reputation, his work is excellent, and he receives good reviews from\ngovernment customers.

A fellow employee stated he worked with and\n16\nhas known Applicant for over 10 yeas as a co-developer of software products.  Applicant is a good\nworker who does a good job. He has never seen Applicant drink alcohol.  Applicant is a better person\nnow than he was when he first met him in 1997.17\nApplicant\u2019s pastor testified he has known Applicant since he joined his church four years\nago.  He knows of Applicant\u2019s problems with substance abuse but has not counseled him directly\nfor it.  Applicant attends his church programs regularly.  He believes Applicant is a transformed man\nwho has no addiction problems.18\nApplicant\u2019s wife stated that they have a better marriage now than when Applicant entered\nrehabilitation.  She has not seen him consume alcohol or drugs since he left rehabilitation.  He did\ncall her when he was on a trip to tell her he had two drinks of alcohol.  He did not drink alcohol after\nthe call.

Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the\nDirective \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.

An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n22\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.23\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n24\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.25\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n26\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n27\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n28\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n29\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d30\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\n\n7\nGuideline J - A history or pattern of criminal activity raises a security concern because it\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nGuideline G - Excessive alcohol consumption raises a security concern because it often leads\nto the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the\nrisk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.\nGuideline H - The improper or illegal involvement with drugs creates a security concern\nbecause it raises questions regarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the\nrisk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\nThe central theme of the three security concerns is a question concerning the person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative\nguidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and abuse of alcohol based on Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions to driving while intoxicated or alcohol-related arrests and/or convictions raises Alcohol\nConsumption Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A7.1.2.1 (alcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents\nrelated to alcohol use).  Driving while intoxicated is one of the examples used for an alcohol-related\nincident away from work.  He was arrested and/or convicted twice for driving under the influence of\nalcohol and once for reckless driving involving alcohol from 1986 to 1996.  These incidents establish\nthe alcohol related incidents away from work.  While the medical information from Applicant\u2019s\ninpatient treatment indicates a cocaine dependence, it also mentions substance abuse.  Applicant\nadmits he is an alcoholic and thought his addiction was to alcohol.  I find there is a medical diagnosis\nof alcohol dependence because the inpatient report indicates substance abuse not merely cocaine\ndependence and Applicant knows he is an alcoholic.  The medical diagnosis from the treating medical\nprofessional raises Alcohol Consumption DC E2.A7.1.2.3 (diagnosis by a credentialed medical\nprofessional (e.g. physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence).  Applicant admits heavy consumption of alcohol over a period of time raising Alcohol\nConsumption DC E2.A7.1.2.5 (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment).  Applicant admitted drinking two drinks after release from his inpatient and aftercare\nprograms raising Alcohol Consumption DC E2.A7.1.2.6 (Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a\ndiagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an\nalcohol rehabilitation program).  It is clearly established there is a security concern for Applicant\u2019s\nconsumption of alcohol.  \n\nDepartment Counsel questioned Applicant concerning cultivation of marijuana.  Applicant admitted knowing\n31\nof the marijuana plants and being at the location where the plants were growing but denied he was involved in the\ngrowing of marijuana.  See, Tr. 50-52. There is no allegation in the SOR concerning cultivation of marijuana.\nDepartment Counsel argued that Applicant\u2019s denial is not credible.  See, Tr. 93.  Since there is no allegation of marijuana\ncultivation, I do not make a factual finding concerning marijuana cultivation and have not considered it as a security\nconcern.\n8\nI considered all of the mitigating conditions under alcohol consumption and find all apply.\nThere was a pattern of alcohol abuse, but there has not been a pattern since 2000.  The problem\noccurred over six years ago, and there is no other indication of any recent substance abuse problems.\nApplicant\u2019s actions since his last offense in 2000, his completion of rehabilitation in 2000, his\nexcellent work performance, and family life with church attendance  are positive changes supportive\nof sobriety.  His consumption of two drinks of alcohol in 2003 is not considered to be consumption\nof alcohol after diagnosis by a medical professional and completion of an aftercare program because\nhe realized his mistake and immediately stopped drinking.  He did not drink to excess or to the point\nof intoxication.  It has been four years since that misstep.  Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) E2.A7.1.3.2 (The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is not indication of a\nrecent problem), and MC E2.A7.1.3.3 (Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety) apply.\nApplicant has mitigated security concerns for his consumption of alcohol.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted use of marijuana and cocaine and the medical diagnosis of cocaine\ndependence raises Drug Involvement DC E2.A8.1.2.1 (Any drug abuse); DC E2.A8.1.2.2 (Illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution), and DC\nE2.A8.1.2.3 (Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical psychologist,\nor psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence).  Drugs are defined as mood and behavior-altering\nsubstances, and include drugs, materials, and chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970.  Drug abuse is the use of an illegal drug or use of a legal drug in\na manner that deviates from approved medical directives. Marijuana and cocaine are listed as drugs\nin the Controlled Substance Act of 1970.  Applicant admitted using marijuana in college in 1980/1981\nand cocaine from 1999 to 2000.   He was admitted to inpatient treatment after cocaine possession and\n31\nthe diagnosis was cocaine dependence.  The security concern for Applicant\u2019s drug involvement is\nestablished.\nI considered Drug Involvement MC E2.A8.1.3.3 (The drug involvement was not recent); MC\nE2.A8.1.3.2 (The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event); MC E2.A8.1.3.3\n(Demonstrated intent not to abuse any drug in the future), and MC E2.A8.1.3.4 (Satisfactory\ncompletion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare\nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical\nprofessional).  Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in 1981 while a college student.  He used cocaine\na minimum of five times from 1999 to 2000.  His last use of cocaine was in 2000.  There has been no\nuse since he was arrested for possession of cocaine in January 2000.  Since his last use was over seven\nyears ago, it is not recent.  However since he used cocaine at least five times, the use was not isolated\nor aberrational.  Applicant successfully completed an inpatient substance abuse program and was\ndetermined by medical professionals to have a good prognosis.  He completed the aftercare program\nand has not used cocaine since his arrest.  He has not abused any substance for over six years, is an\nexcellent worker, and involved in church and family activities.  He knows he is an alcoholic, and\nknows he cannot use an illegal substance or alcohol in the future.  Applicant mitigated security\n\n9\nconcerns for drug involvement.\nApplicant admits he was arrested and convicted three times for either driving while intoxicated\nor reckless driving related to alcohol use.  He admits he was arrested for marijuana and cocaine\npossession.  Applicant\u2019s arrests for the above alcohol-related offenses and drug possession raises\nCriminal Conduct DC E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged), and DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (a single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses).\nI considered Criminal Conduct MC E2.A10.1.3.3 (the criminal behavior was not recent); and\nMC E2.A10.1.6 (there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).  The possession of marijuana\nhappened over 26 years ago, and the possession of cocaine over seven years ago.  The last driving\nwhile intoxicated offense happened in 1996, over 11 years ago.  These criminal activities are not\nrecent.  Applicant completed an inpatient and aftercare rehabilitation program with a good prognosis.\nHe has been drug and alcohol free for over six years.  His wife and co-workers attest to his substance\nabuse abstinence and his commitment to sobriety.  These is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.\nApplicant has mitigated security concerns for criminal conduct. \nThese mitigating conditions were also considered together with the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d.\nI considered Applicant\u2019s candor and honesty concerning his drug and alcohol abuse, his successful\ncompletion of substance abuse treatment, and his over six years of sobriety and being substance abuse\nfree.  Applicant demonstrated he exercises good judgment, and is reliable, and trustworthy.  Applicant\nhas  mitigated security concerns regarding alcohol consumption, drug abuse, and criminal conduct.\nClearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a. - 3.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d.:\nWithdrawn\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On June 16, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F, (financial considerations). Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on July 25, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations under the Guideline.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 8, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 28, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for April 17, 2007. I conducted the hearing as scheduled to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. The\nGovernment offered six exhibits for admission in the record marked as Government Exhibits (GE)\n1-6. The exhibits were admitted into evidence without objections. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf and offered fifteen exhibits for admission into the record. They were marked as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits (AE) A-O and admitted into evidence without objections. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on April 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 49 years old, married and has two children and one stepchild. His two children\nlive at home. Applicant has been employed with a federal contractor as a software instructor since\nJuly 2004. His wife is employed at a base commissary. He was honorably discharged and retired\nfrom the Army in 2001, as a Sergeant First Class (E-7). \nApproximately a year before he retired he started a building cleaning business. He was\nunfamiliar with complexities and financial requirements for starting and maintaining a business. He\ndid not understand the tax requirements for the business. He also did not understand how to budget\nhis fiances. He filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy protection in November 2000. Around the same time\nhe was retiring from the service his business lost the cleaning contract which was its source of\nrevenue.  He also was using credit cards to keep up with his expenditures. When he was discharged\n3\nhe had a low paying job and could not keep up with the bankruptcy payments and requested a\nreduction in his monthly payments.  The request was denied and the bankruptcy was dismissed in\n4\nJanuary 2002. Applicant was then obligated to pay all of his creditors that were included in the\n\nTr. 68-69; AE I.\n5\nTr. 72-73; GE 4 and 5; AE J.\n6\nTr. 74-76; AE H.\n7\nTr. 79-83.

He left\nthat job in 2004 to work for his present employer for better pay. Applicant\u2019s present job offers him\nopportunities for increased pay when he deploys to Kuwait and Iraq, which he has done. With his\nincreased pay and the extra pay, he has been paying his debts. In approximately 2005, Applicant\nattended a budgeting class to learn how to manage his finances. This class taught him how to budget.\nHe has not accepted any new credit cards. He pays his bills by allotment. He has not incurred any\nnew expenses and is now paying his bills on time and living within his means. \nThe debt in SOR 1.a. was for a water purifying system for his residence, an appliance he\ndeemed a necessity. The debt was settled and paid in July 2006.5\nThe debt in SOR 1.b was for a credit card used to pay for gas and emergencies. It was opened\nshortly before Applicant was discharged from the military. He stopped paying on it because after his\ndischarge his pay was substantially reduced. This debt was paid in July 2006.6\nThe debt in SOR 1.c is a state tax lien attributed to Applicant\u2019s business. It was for employee\nwage taxes. Applicant paid the debt and was released from the lien in August 2005.7\nThe debt in SOR 1.d. is a state tax lien from a different state where Applicant had been\nstationed. He believed when he was transferred overseas and sold his house that all taxes were paid.\nIt was not until he returned to the United States that he received notice of the tax debt. There was\nconfusion due to the town listed on the debt. Applicant retrieved a credit report and contacted the\nstate\u2019s tax office. The state had obtained a judgment against Applicant. He paid the judgment and\nthe lien was released in August 2006.  \n8\nThe debt in SOR 1.e was a consumer debt for furniture. Applicant opened the account in\nJanuary 2000 and his last activity on the account was February 2002.  Applicant settled the debt in\n9\nJuly 2006.10\nThe debt in SOR 1.f was for a gas credit card. Applicant opened the account in February 2000\nand defaulted on the account in August 2002. He paid the account in May 2005.11\nThe debt in SOR 1.g was a medical debt that was incurred in 2002-2003. Applicant paid the\ndebt in May 2006.\n\nTr. 90-91; GE 5 at 5; Answer.\n12\nTr. 91-92; AE E; Answer.\n13\nTr. 98-105.\n14\nAE A.\n15\nAE B.\n16\n5\nThe debt in SOR 1. h was for a consumer credit card opened in July 1998 and the last activity\non the account was October 2002. Applicant had been paying this debt through the bankruptcy order\nfor approximately six months. When it was dismissed, he was required to pay the debt without the\nprotection. Applicant settled and paid the account in June 2006.  \n12\nThe debt in SOR 1.i was a credit card debt. Applicant settled and paid this account in June\n2006.13\nApplicant used the extra funds from deploying to dangerous areas and a loan against he and\nhis wife\u2019s life insurance policies, to pay their debts. He has an allotment set up to repay his life\ninsurance. He anticipates another deployment. With both he and his wife working, they are able to\nmaintain their budget and pay their bills on time. Through his budgeting class, he learned to live\nwithin his means and better understands how finances work. He does not have any delinquent\ndebts.  He makes all of his monthly expense payments on time. \n14\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors describes him as a person whose ethics and character are beyond\nreproach. They believe he has the highest personal integrity. He follows procedures and is considered\na invaluable asset to his company.  He is described as a professional who has earned the respect of\n15\nthe military and civilian personnel he serves.  \n16\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 11, 1997).\n17\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The government\n17\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n18\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n19\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n20\ndecision.21\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n22\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n23\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n24\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n25\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\n\n7\nGuideline F- Financial Considerations-a security concern exists when a person has significant\ndelinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who\nis financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to\nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), apply in this case. Applicant accumulated debts that were placed for\ncollection, charged off, or for which a lien was entered against him. They remained delinquent for a\nsignificant period of time.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) and\nespecially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (It was\nan isolated incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or in\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolve\nor is under control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nApplicant had many delinquent debts that were delinquent for a substantial period of time. All\nof the debts were paid in the last two years. These debts were not isolated and many remained unpaid\nuntil this past year. Therefore, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 and E2A6.1.3.2 do not apply.\nApplicant started a business without full understanding of the financial requirements, or the\ntax requirements. He was having problems with the business at the same time he was being\ndischarged from the military and his pay was substantially reduced. He used credit cards to help pay\nhis expenses. He filed for bankruptcy, but could not keep up with the payments. Applicant\u2019s\nunderemployment was beyond his control, but starting a business without taking the proper steps to\nunderstand the requirements were within his control. I find FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 partially applies. \nApplicant has literally dug himself out of a financial hole. Two years ago he took classes to\nlearn how to manage his finances, budget his money, and pay his debts. He took what he learned and\napplied it to his financial situation. He has no new debts, has no new credit cards, and systematically\nsettled and paid his outstanding debts. He has a better paying job and with bonus pay from deploying\nand a loan against his life insurance, he has paid the debts. He is repaying his life insurance. He also\ndoes not live beyond his means. Applicant got into financial problems, but instead of ignoring them\nhe took appropriate action, learned from his mistakes, and resolved his debts. Therefore, I find FC\nMC E2.A6.1.3.4 and E2.A6.1.3.6 apply.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\n\n8\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in analyzing the evidence. I considered Applicant\u2019s business\ndifficulties and lengthy period his debts were delinquent. I also considered that he was proactive in\nlearning how to manage his finances and then applied what he learned to his situation. He has settled\nand paid all of his debts. Equally important is that he set up a budget and is living within his means,\nso he does not have future problems. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this\ncase, that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nAccordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In support of this proposition, Counsel cites the\nfollowing:  the Chinese government\u2019s use of torture; its harassment, detention, and imprisonment\nof those perceived as threatening to the communist party or the government; its use of arbitrary arrest\nand detention; and its monitoring of citizen\u2019s mail, telephone and electronic communications.1\nCounsel  argues that neither the Judge\u2019s analysis nor the record as a whole \u201csupport a rational finding\nthat the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress resulting from Applicant\u2019s family. .\n. is reduced to an acceptable level.\u201d  Given the record in this case, Department Counsel\u2019s argument\nis persuasive.  \nWe have considered the Department Counsel\u2019s brief, Applicant\u2019s reply brief, the Judge\u2019s\ndecision, and the record as a whole.  We note the number of Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives who are\ncitizens and residents of China, the fact that Applicant and her husband communicate regularly with\ntheir Chinese relatives,  the fact that Applicant\u2019s husband is a citizen of China and not of the U.S.,\n2\nholding a Chinese passport.  The Judge correctly noted that China engages in military and economic\nespionage, and abuses human rights.  Department Counsel recites record evidence about specific\npractices of the Chinese government, especially that of monitoring mail and electronic\ncommunications.  These facts suggest a tangible and meaningful possibility that Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers could become a means through which she could be subject to coercion.  The government\u2019s\nconcern is not sufficiently refuted by record evidence favorable to Applicant.  We conclude that\nneither the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis nor the record evidence as a whole reasonably support the\n\n4\nJudge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Applicant has met her burden of persuasion.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nThe Applicant was not responsible for the debts in the SOR becoming past due.  His ex-wife\nwas a bad money manager during the time he was deployed for the military, and she also fraudulently\nsigned his name to several credit card applications.  In their divorce, the ex-wife agreed to be solely\nresponsible for paying the debts.  The Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances,\nwhich are unlikely to recur, and do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 25, 2006, and requested a hearing\n(Answer).  The case was received by the undersigned on July 6, 2006, and a Notice of Hearing was\nissued on August 22, 2006.\nA hearing was held on September 14, 2006, at which the Government presented three\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called one additional witness,\nand also submitted six exhibits.  The transcript was received on September 25, 2006. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 50 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to\nretain a Secret-level DoD security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment\nin the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based\nupon the allegations set forth in the SOR.  The following findings of fact are entered as to each\nparagraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\nexhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial considerations).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that\nthe Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant owes ten creditors approximately $37,673.00 (SOR 1.a.\nthrough 1.j.).  The Applicant has repeatedly denied any responsibility for these debts, stating that\nthey were entered into by his ex-wife without his knowledge or permission.  Furthermore, he states\n\n3\nthat his ex-wife forged his name to several credit applications.  The ex-wife provided a sworn\nstatement, attached to the Answer, stating, \u201cThe debts listed below [same debts as in the SOR] are\nmine and were incurred without the knowledge or permission of [the Applicant].\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B.)\nThe Applicant and his ex-wife were married in 1989 and divorced in 2005. (Government\nExhibit 1 at question 8; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, C and D.)  The Applicant was in the Coast Guard\nduring most of their marriage, often deployed at sea.  Accordingly, his ex-wife by necessity had\ncontrol of the family finances.  Her financial mismanagement was one of the primary reasons for the\ndivorce.  (Transcript at 55-61.)  \nThe ex-wife agreed to take responsibility for all debts of the marriage when the couple filed\nfor divorce.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 2.)  She further submitted a statement to the state court\nstating, \u201cI . . . am the responsible party for the financial payment of the debt incurred during the\nmarriage.  I request that it be ordered that [the Applicant\u2019s] name be removed from all joint accounts\nand that it be ordered that he is no longer responsible for payments to the accounts that I am taking\nfinancial responsibility for.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  Finally, in the divorce decree, the court\nspecifically found, \u201cThe written agreements between the petitioners concerning spousal maintenance\nand tax consequences, if any, division of property, including retirement benefits, and allocation of\nobligations are just.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 1.)  (See Transcript at 11.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s ex-wife has done more than accept responsibility legally for these debts, she\nis working to resolve them.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E consists of documentation from a financial\nmanagement organization the ex-wife is using to help resolve her past due indebtedness.  The\nDepartment Counsel at the hearing expressed her concern that all of the debts in the SOR are not\nincluded in the ex-wife\u2019s repayment plan.  A close examination of the documents resolves this\nconcern.  The specific debts the ex-wife proposes to resolve through the debt management\norganization are set forth on pages 12 and 13 of Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.  Comparing the account\nnumbers found in the credit reports (Government Exhibits 2 and 3) with Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E\u2019s\npages 12 and 13 shows the following: SOR 1.a. is creditor 7; SOR 1.c. is creditor 3; SOR 1.d. is\ncreditor 5; SOR 1.e. is creditor 2; SOR 1.f. is creditor 9; SOR 1.g. is creditor 11; SOR 1.h. is creditor\n4; SOR 1.i. is creditor 1.\nThe remaining two debts in the SOR are not covered by the repayment plan.  The ex-wife\nadmitted responsibility for the $754.00 debt in SOR 1.b.  She testified that, since the debt was less\nthan $1,000.00, the financial management organization would not handle this debt.  She further\nindicated that she would pay this bill herself.  (Transcript at 18.)  SOR 1.j. is a $57.00 long distance\ntelephone bill that the ex-wife is disputing, stating it had been paid.  (Transcript at 17.)\nThe Department Counsel asked the ex-wife, \u201cEven though you accepted responsibility [for\nthe debts] as part of your marriage dissolution, has your husband - - ex-husband offered to help you\nget this [debt repayment] going faster?\u201d  The ex-wife replied, \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t expect him to.\u201d\n(Transcript at 22.)  The Applicant testified about his willingness to pay some portion of the debt,\nwhich the court ordered his wife to pay.  (Transcript at 57.)\nThe Applicant testified that he did not know about most of the accounts until the divorce.\nHe specifically stated that his ex-wife would forge his name to credit applications.  The Applicant\n\n4\nunderstands that he could formally accuse his ex-wife of forgery.  However, for the sake of his son\nwho is still living with his ex-wife, he will not do that.  (Transcript at 35, 38-39.)\nThe Applicant further stated that, in general, he does not use credit except for large\npurchases.  He further stated, and the exhibits confirm, that he has no past due debts other than those\nin the SOR.  (Transcript at 54-55.)\nIt was obvious during the hearing that a considerable amount of animosity still exists between\nthe Applicant and his ex-wife.  The Applicant testified that it is difficult for him to have a discussion\nwith his ex-wife about finances.  (Transcript at 54.)  I have considered these facts in making a\ncredibility determination with regards to the testimony of each of them.\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant testified at length about his career in the Coast Guard.  He is proud of what\nhe accomplished, while primarily serving at sea.  (Transcript at 38-39, 59-60, 62-63.)\nThe Managing Partner of the Applicant\u2019s employer submitted a statement on the Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf.  He stated that the Applicant has been promoted and received merit raises because of, \u201cHis\nexcellent performance and demonstrated interest in ensuring that contractual requirements are met.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\na.\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb.\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\nc.\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n\n5\nd.\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.\nThe voluntariness of participation\nf.\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\ng.\nThe motivation for the conduct\nh.\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be have financial problems that demonstrates poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\n\nMurray v. Ledbetter, 14 P.3d 492, 501 n.42 (Alaska S. Ct. 2006).\n1\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-23511 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006.)\n2\n6\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (Guideline F).  Disqualifying\nCondition E2.A6.1.2.1. applies as there is, \u201cA history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The\nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife has admitted that she entered into many of these credit accounts without the\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge, and often by forging his name.  She has also agreed to be legally responsible\nfor the debts.  Both parties agree that his knowledge of the family\u2019s true financial situation when\nthese debts were incurred was minimal, at best.  In fact, it is obvious that these financial problems,\nbrought about primarily by the actions of his ex-wife, were a primary cause of the divorce.\nMitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.3. applies as, \u201cThe conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . divorce or separation).\u201d  \nI find that Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.6. also applies to this case.  (\u201cThe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d) In making this\nfinding, I have specifically considered the fact that none of the debts have been paid.  However, for\nthe following reasons, I find that this is a case where the condition still applies.  The state where they\nlive specifically allows for marital debts to be divided between the parties, as here.  After their\ndivorce, both the Applicant and his ex-wife acted with the good faith belief that the ex-wife was the\nonly person legally responsible for the debts.  However, in fact, \u201cThe proposition seems universally\nsettled that a divorce decree incorporating an agreement between divorcing spouses does not affect\nthe rights of third-party creditors.\u201d   That being said, the legal agreement of the ex-wife to be solely\n1\nresponsible for the debts has some weight.  In addition, she was vehement in stating that she did not\nexpect the Applicant to help her pay the debts off, and she has engaged in actions to pay them off\nherself.  The Applicant and his ex-wife understand that these past due debts exist and, within their\nabilities, are attempting to resolve them.  Based on the totality of the evidence, it is clear that the\nApplicant has acted responsibly under the particular circumstances of this case.   \n2\nIn addition, application of the General Factors and the whole person concept is appropriate\nand supports a decision in the Applicant's favor.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct are\nunique and, in my opinion, will not recur (factor b); there is little to no likelihood or recurrence\n(factor i); and, under the circumstances, there is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or\nduress (factor h).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

Corl, Jr., Esq. \nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant failed to mitigate criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns relating\nto allegations of corporate fraud and false claims against a former employer (1999-2004) for which\nhe and three others were charged with a felony and paid restitution and a fine. The conduct occurred\nin 2003 and 2004 when he was investigated and discharged by his employer. The final judgment in\nthe criminal matter occurred only two years ago. While he is highly regarded by his present employer\nand has taken positive steps to rehabilitate, it is premature at this time to grant a clearance. Clearance\nis denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn March 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn March 27, 2006, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2007. A\nnotice of hearing was issued on March 22, 2007, for a hearing that was held on April 10, 2007. The\nGovernment and Applicant each introduced five exhibits at the hearing and all were admitted into\nevidence. One witness testified for the government. Applicant and four witnesses testified on his\nbehalf. The transcript was received April 26, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nThe hearing in this matter concluded late in the day on April 10, 2007, and the parties agreed\nthat, in lieu of oral arguments, written arguments would be submitted at scheduled times. The\ngovernment submitted its argument on May 4, 2007, and therein moved to amend the SOR to add\nallegations relating to three new factual issues brought out in the hearing involving the personal\nconduct allegations concerning falsifications relating to his prior employment. Applicant objected\nto the amendments on the grounds that it was too late to make such an amendment, and, if it were\ngranted, requested that the hearing be re-opened for additional testimony. \nThe government cited several Appeal Board decisions affirming the right to amend during\na hearing as stated in Section E3.17 of Additional Procedural Guideline of the Directive. I find\nnothing in the cited cases to indicate whether an amendment can be made during closing arguments\neven when they are presented in oral form. In this case, because they were submitted several weeks\nafter the record was closed in written argument, I sustain Applicant\u2019s objection. To grant it would\nrequire opening the hearing for additional testimony. Judicial economy indicates a contrary result.\n\n3\nThe SOR was amended on motion of the government during the hearing to strike language\nin Par. 1.a. alleging that Applicant pled guilty to the larceny charge.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied both allegations in the SOR. After a complete review of the allegations in\nthe SOR, the documentary evidence, and testimony in the record, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a major defense contractor, working as an engineer\nsince October 25, 2004. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and is working on an MBA which he expects to\nreceive in 2008. Before his present employment he worked for another defense contractor from May\n1999 until August 10, 2004 when he and others were terminated after an internal corporate\ninvestigation of financial improprieties in the company (Exh. 4). The investigation involved\nfalsification of company expense claims and using company funds for personal gain during a seven-\nmonth period at the end of his employment. Applicant asked to be permitted to resign but was\nadvised that he was already terminated. The allegations involved Applicant, his supervisor, and two\nother staff members who all worked together as a marketing team for a service. He was unemployed\nfor two months until he was hired by his present employer in his home state. He also had worked for\nanother defense contractor between 1996 and 1999 when he held a security clearance. He held an\ninterim clearance with his present employer at the time of his arrest but it was revoked when this\nproceeding began. He now works on an unclassified project.\nAs a result of the investigation and a referral to the district attorney, Applicant was arrested\nin November 2004 only a few weeks after he was hired by his present employer. Criminal charges\nof felony larceny were filed on April 13, 2005. He wanted to litigate the charges but the expense to\ndo so was prohibitive so he negotiated an admission of facts and agreed to pay $4,900 in restitution\nand a $1,000 fine. The case was continued with no findings and he was released on $500 bail. He\nadvised his present employer when he was arrested and the charges were filed. The company security\noffice advised the Defense Security Service on November 15, 2004 (Exh. 3). On June 13, 2005, the\ncase was dismissed on recommendation of the probation office since he had no further difficulties\nduring the past sixty days (Exh. 5).\nThe improprieties and illegal actions about which Applicant, his supervisor, and the other\ntwo employees were investigated and charged arose as a result of actions that were instigated by their\nsupervisor to make financial claims against their employer using false information to cover certain\nexpenditures. Applicant\u2019s supervisor was authorized to approve the claims made by the three\nmembers of his staff. The claims were usually made by the staff members and approved by the\nsupervisor. In some instances the supervisor had access to the credit cards of his staff and made\ncharges on them directly. He then told the staff members to pay the cards and make claims for\ncompany reimbursement which he would and did approve. Threats were sometimes used by the\nsupervisor to obtain the cooperation of his staff on financial claims (Tr. 92). This process was\nfollowed because, if the supervisor submitted the claims himself, then his own supervisor would be\nthe approval authority for the charges whereas he had the authority to give final approval for claims\nsubmitted by his own subordinates. \n\n4\nThese charges included such things as expensive tickets for major sports events, restaurant\ndinners, and corporate gift cards. Some of these expenses incurred on the credit cards were for the\nsupervisor\u2019s travel expenses when he used Applicant\u2019s travel card. Often customers names were\nlisted on the expense vouchers when only the marketing team and their families were the guests.\nApplicant and his team members were sometimes told by their supervisor that these were\nexpressions of appreciation for their good work and were authorized by the company since the\nsupervisor controlled the budget for his marketing group.\nOne instance involved a trip to Europe when Applicant intended to take his wife along at\ncompany expense which his supervisor authorized. The business part of the trip in Paris was\ncancelled but the supervisor authorized him to take the trip as a vacation at company expense. He\ndid so but did some company business during the four days in Paris at the company office and\ncontinued on to Sweden where other company business was conducted. Applicant was aware that\nthe practices he engaged in probably were in violation of company policy but acceded to his\nsupervisor\u2019s requests. At one point he did raise a question about the practices to another supervisor,\nwithout results. \nThe supervisor was often late in approving company reimbursements for the claims and the\ncompany was often late in paying the claims so penalties and interest accumulated on the credit cards\nof Applicant and the other staff members. Applicant and the other staff members then submitted\nfalse vouchers for non-existent expenditures to the company to obtain reimbursement for those\ncharges which were occasionally as much as $1,000. Those claims were the only ones directly\nattributable to Applicant by the company investigators and accounted for approximately half of his\nrestitution charges. The other half of his restitution was for the costs of the company investigators\nwho performed the internal investigation. Other false claims that he made on behalf of the supervisor\nwere attributed the supervisor for restitution. In addition to the restitution paid by Applicant, the\nsupervisor paid over $20,000 in restitution and the other two members of the staff each paid amounts\nsimilar to Applicant\u2019s in restitution based on the amounts of the corporate fraud attributed to each\n(Exh. A). \nAlthough Applicant holds his former supervisor responsible for the false claims since it was\nhe who encouraged and authorized the conduct, he recognizes his own culpability in the matter and\nnow realizes that he should have taken steps to report and end the practices. He has had no contact\nwith his former supervisor or his former colleagues on the marketing team since his employment\nterminated. \nWhen Applicant applied for work with his present employer, he did not reveal the reasons\nfor departing his former employment but only advised them that he wanted to relocate in his home\ncity which was his choice as a place of employment. He did advise them fully a few weeks later\nwhen he was arrested and charged, and they continued his employment. He is well regarded by his\nemployer in his evaluations during the three years of his employment (Exh. C). He has had extensive\ntraining in a great variety of subjects including ethics and personal conduct (Exh. B). These subjects\nwere not covered by training of his former employer and he has benefitted from the past three years\nof instruction (Tr. 184). \n\n5\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR:\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, a security concern arises when there is a history of\npattern of criminal activity that creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness (E2.A10.1.1.). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged (E2.A10.1.2.1.), or a single serious offense or multiple lesser offenses\n(E2.A10.1.2.2.). The evidence raises those concerns. The allegations could be mitigated if the\ncriminal behavior was not recent (E2.A10.1.3.1.), or there is clear evidence of successful\nrehabilitation (E2.A10.1.3.6.). While the conduct ended with his termination in 2004, the criminal\nproceedings that developed as a result of that conduct ended only two years ago. There is evidence\nof rehabilitation but more time is needed to satisfactorily establish that there is clear evidence of\nrehabilitation as the guidelines require. \nUnder Guideline E Personal Conduct, actions involving questionable judgment,\n\n6\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). The deliberate\nfalsification of expense accounts of his former employer was established by corporate investigators\nand resulted in state criminal felony charges which are conditions raising security concern\n(E2.A5.1.2.1). The burden shifts to the Applicant to show that Mitigating Conditions (MC) are\napplicable to him. While it is unlikely that these events could lead to coercion, I find that there are\nno mitigating conditions that are fully applicable to facts and circumstances of this case. \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant is an impressive young man who has a bright future with his present employer. His\nemployer is aware of his past conduct having become fully aware of it only a few weeks after he\njoined the company, and did not give the reasons for leaving the former employer when he was hired.\nThis is a tribute to him and is illustrative of  the opinion of him held by his employer. While he has\nlearned a valuable lesson in corporate ethical conduct, he was old enough at the time of the actions\nfor which he has been punished to know better than to join in the effort of his supervisor to take\nadvantage of his employer. The conduct occurred over time and involved multiple false claims. The\nactivity was induced by the supervisor but Applicant was motivated by a desire to get along with the\nsupervisor and enhance his career. While there is little likelihood of a recurrence of such conduct,\nI conclude that, because the actions taken against him only ended less than two years ago, a decision\nin his favor at this time is not warranted. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, it is premature at this time to grant him access to classified information.\nThus, I find against Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance\n\n7\nis denied.\nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a 64-year-old engineer who as born in China in 1942, came to the United States\nin about 1976, and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1985.  In a second marriage, he wed\na Chinese citizen in 2005.  She continues to resides in Hong Kong as do many of his siblings.  He\nhas close family, professional, and financial ties to Hong Kong/China.  No adequate mitigation has\nbeen established.  Clearance is denied.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant (Government\u2019s Exhibit\n(GX) 1).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nrequired under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na trustworthiness determination for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a trustworthiness determination\nshould be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn December 6, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and\nelected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the written record; i.e., without\na hearing.  On February 28, Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nApplicant was instructed to submit any response within 30 days after receipt of the FORM.  Any\nresponse was due by April 13, 2007, but none was received.  This matter was assigned to me on\nApril 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The November 17, 2006 SOR\ncontains six (6) allegations under Guideline C (Foreign Influence).  Applicant admits six allegations\n(GX 3).  All admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline C (Foreign Influence) \n1.a.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of the United Kingdom and resident of Hong Kong.\n1.b.  Applicant\u2019s wife owns property in Hong Kong.  \n1c.  Applicant has three brothers and a sister who are citizens and residents of China.\n1.d.  From 1997 to 2002, while a naturalized citizen of the United States, Applicant accepted\nemployment at a university in Hong Kong and spoke at a number of Chinese universities and\n\n3\ninstitutes.\n1.e.  Applicant visited China in November 1994, June 1995, October 1997 to April 2002,\nMarch 2005, and November to December 2005.\nPOLICIES \nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nto the conduct, to include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the ndividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (Directive, on page 19 of Enclosure 2).\nI have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na trustworthiness determination for the Applicant.\nA person seeking a security clearance enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is 64 years old.  In his response to the SOR, he admits all six allegations.  I find\nthat all six allegations are independently established by the Government\u2019s evidence (Government\u2019s\nExhibits 1-9).  Since Applicant did not submit and response to the FORM, his evidence ends with\nhis response to the SOR in December 2006.  Based on the totality of the record, I conclude the\nfollowing:\n\n4\nHong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(China) since July 1, 1997.  Hong Kong currently possesses a degree of autonomy, except on the\nareas of defense and foreign policy.  China has recently been increasing its oversight into Hong\nKong\u2019s management of political affairs (Attachments: Background Note: China and Consular\nInformation Sheet Hong Kong). \nUnder Chinese nationality law, persons who are of Chinese descent and who were born on\nthe mainland of China or Hong Kong are citizens of China.  China\u2019s Military Intelligence\nDepartment is responsible for collecting military information about the United States and China is\nofficially recognized as being an active collector of military and economic intelligence in and about\nthe United States.  In addition, individuals traveling to China may at times be placed under\nsurveillance by Chinese security personnel (Attachments cited in footnotes 8-19 in the FORM).\nUnder these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s situation must be viewed with particular care.\nApplicant was born in Hong Kong in 1942, during World War II.  At the time Hong Kong\nwas British territory, occupied by the Japanese.  At that time, China was an ally of the United States.\nIn1948 China came under Communist rule, and has remained so up to the present.  Applicant came\nto the United Sates in 1976 and became a citizen in 1985 (GX 4 at 1).  Applicant\u2019s wife, three\nbrothers and one sister remain citizens and residents of Hong Kong and China.  Applicant\u2019s sister,\nwho was a citizen and resident of Hong Kong, introduced him to his wife, who was a Chinese citizen\nand resident, in about 1997.  From October 1999 to March 2002, they lived together in Hong Kong,\nwhere Applicant was teaching at a university.   They were married in December 2005.  Applicant\nhas applied for an immigrant visa to allow her to join him in the United States.  In the interim, she\ncontinues to reside in Hong Kong.  They are in frequent and close communication (GX 9).  \nApplicant is also in frequent communication with his four siblings in Hong Kong (Id.).  One\nbrother is an engineer, as is Applicant.  The record does not show wether any relatives have\nconnections with the Chinese government.  When Applicant taught at a university in China from\n1997 to 2002, he was paid about $441,908.00.  He also made academic visits to universities in\nvarious parts of China.  Along the way he a number of lasting friendships (Id.).  \nDisqualifying/Mitigating Conditions (DC/MC).\nDC 7(a) applies, in that Applicant has \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure\nor coercion.\u201d  The Directive makes it clear that it is not so much the existence of foreign contacts\nthat is of the most concern but the heightened risk that exists because of the nature of the foreign\ncountry and the closeness of the ties with that country.  In the present case, China is officially\nrecognized as a major source of espionage against the United States and Applicant\u2019s ties with China\ncan only be described as broad and deep.  \nAs to mitigating conditions, the record compels the conclusion that a heightened risk exists,\nand is complicated by Applicant\u2019s extensive ties with China, including his wife, and family\neconomic and other ties with that country.  MC 8(a) requires evidence that circumstances exist that\nmake it unlikely that an applicant will/might be forced choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual (his wife),group (the university where he taught from 1997 to 2002), organization or\n\n5\ngovernment (Hong Kong/China) and the interests of the United States.  I can not conclude that such\nevidence exists to the extent it mitigate the risk involved.  Therefore, MC 8(a) is not applicable.\nLikewise, MC 8(b) requires that an applicant\u2019s loyalty or obligation to the foreign person or entity\nis so low and their loyalty to the United States is so high that they could be expected to resolve any\nconflict in favor of the United States.  This too is not demonstrated by the record evidence.\nThe nature of his frequent contacts with his foreign wife and siblings in Hong Kong/China\nmakes this mitigating condition inapplicable.  The record does not suggest any disloyalty by\nApplicant to the United States, but it does suggest feelings for his family in China that increase the\nrisks to a level that is unacceptable under the Directive. \nIn summary, the evidence in the FORM  makes a prima facie case of ineligibility, and nothing\nApplicant has said or done has come close to mitigating the Government\u2019s evidence.  Accordingly,\nApplicant has not established that he possesses the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness\nrequired of anyone seeking access to the nations\u2019s secrets. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline C (Foreign Influence)  \n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.e.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol consumption and financial management problems\nhave resulted in six convictions for driving while intoxicated and the accrual of approximately\n$33,000 in delinquent debt. He intentionally omitted this information from a security clearance\napplication in 2004. These issues generate security concerns that he failed to mitigate. Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nTr. 26.\n1\nTr. 27.\n2\nExhibit A.\n3\nExhibit 7.\n4\nExhibit 9.\n5\nExhibit 3 at 2.\n6\n2\nOn February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1992, as amended. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer and request for a hearing on March 19, 2007.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 20, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August\n31, 2007, scheduling it for September 13, 2007. Applicant waived his right to 15 days notice of the\nhearing. During the hearing, I received 14 government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. The record\nwas left open at Applicant\u2019s request to allow him an opportunity to submit exhibits that he had been\nunable to obtain in advance of the hearing. Within the time allotted, he submitted one exhibit that was\nadmitted into the record. DOHA received the transcript on September 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of SOR Paragraphs 1 and 2 except subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. He\ndid not answer Paragraph 3. I have construed his non-answer as a general denial. The SOR admissions\nare incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old single man. His three past marriages ended in divorce, and he has\nno children. He earned two years of college credits and completed electrician\u2019s trade school.  \n1\nApplicant is a supervisory electrician who works on classified electronic systems for a defense\ncontractor.  According to his supervisor, he is \u201can excellent employee with good technical ability and\n2\nexcellent attendance.\u201d  He has worked for the same employer for 30 years. He has held a clearance\n3\nintermittently since 1987.4\nBetween 1979 and 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged six times with driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol (DUI).  The 1979 charge was dismissed and the remainder resulted in\n5\nconvictions. During this period, Applicant was a heavy drinker, consuming approximately 10 beers\nper week and frequently getting intoxicated.6\nAfter his sixth conviction, in 1991, the court placed him under two years of supervised\nprobation, ordered him to attend alcoholic\u2019s anonymous (AA) sessions, and participate in alcohol\n\nSee note 5 at 2.\n7\nExhibit 6 at 1.\n8\nExhibit 9.\n9\nTr. 49.\n10\nTr. 55, 56.\n11\nTr. 59.\n12\nAnswer; Tr. 35.\n13\nExhibit 11 at 5.\n14\nTr. 32.\n15\nTr. 40.\n16\nTr.42.\n17\n3\nabuse treatment.  Applicant stopped drinking alcohol in March 1992, promising never to drink it\n7\nagain.8\nOn November 17, 1993, the government issued a statement of reasons alleging that his history\nof alcohol-related arrests and alcohol consumption rendered him a security risk. After considering the\nrecord evidence, a DOHA administrative judge revoked Applicant\u2019s clearance in November 1994.9\nApplicant continued to abstain from alcohol consumption for another eight years.  At some\n10\npoint during this time, he reapplied for a clearance, and his application was granted.  \n11\nApplicant resumed drinking alcohol in approximately 2002. On the afternoon of June 25,\n2003, the car Applicant was driving collided with another vehicle. He was intoxicated.12\nSubsequently, the police charged him with DUI. On May 27, 2004, he pleaded guilty, and was\nsentenced to 45 days in jail, ordered to participate in one year of counseling, and placed on probation\nfor five years.  He attended the counseling, as ordered, and remains on probation. \n13\nApplicant owes nine creditors approximately $33,000. The debt includes the deficiency owed\nfrom a car repossession (SOR subparagraph 1.a) and one that resulted from an adverse civil judgment\nrelating to Applicants 2003 car accident (SOR subparagraph 1.c). The remainder are owed to credit\ncard companies. A tenth delinquency is alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e. It alleges a $57 delinquency\nresulting from a bounced check. Applicant satisfied this in 1994.14\nAll of the other debts are delinquent. According to Applicant, they accrued because \u201c. . . one\nthing led to another . . . and [he] couldn\u2019t afford to pay them.\u201d  \n15\nIn 2005, Applicant consulted a credit agency to help him get his delinquencies charged off his\ncredit report, and enable him to purchase a home.  The credit agency\u2019s efforts were unsuccessful, and\n16\nApplicant was unable to purchase the home.17\n\nTr. 60.\n18\nExhibit 2, Personnel Security Questionnaire, Standard Form 49, dated March 27, 1987.\n19\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n20\n4\nOn January 28, 2004, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86). He was\nrequired to disclose whether he had been arrested, charged or convicted in the past seven years,\nwhether he had ever been charged or convicted of a felony or an alcohol-related offense, and whether\nany criminal charges were currently pending. He neither disclosed his past DUI convictions, nor the\n2003 charge, which was pending when he completed the application. \nThe application also required Applicant to disclose whether he had ever been more than 180\ndays delinquent on any debts, and whether he was currently 90 days delinquent on any debts.\nApplicant did not disclose any of his delinquencies, either.\nIn response to cross-examination questions, Applicant stated he omitted the information\nbecause he \u201cgot nervous,\u201d and the questions \u201cthrew him off.\u201d  This is not the first time Applicant has\n18\ncompleted a security clearance application.19\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that\nmay be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in\neach case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n20\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18.\n21\nAG \u00b6 21.\n22\n5\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of\n21\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts, FC DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e):\nconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Although he did\nconsult a credit agency in 2005, his goal was to get the delinquencies charged off, not satisfied. His\nefforts were unsuccessful, and since then, he has not made any  efforts at resolving his delinquencies.\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies remain a security concern.\nAlcohol Consumption\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse and alcohol-related arrests trigger the\n22\napplication of Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) 22 (a): alcohol related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, and AC DC 22 (c): habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant has been\nconvicted of DUI six times in the past 25 years. The most recent occurred nine years after the\ngovernment had revoked his clearance based upon alcohol consumption concerns generated by the\nprevious DUIs. Although he completed alcohol counseling consistent with a court order, he is still\non probation. Applicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\n\nAG \u00b6 15.\n23\n6\nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions trigger the issue of whether Personal\n23\nConduct (PC DC) 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, applies. Because\nApplicant had completed a security clearance application in the past, his explanation for omitting the\nconvictions and the financial delinquencies was particularly dubious. \nI conclude his omissions were intentional. PC DC 16(a) applies to the security clearance\napplication omissions without mitigation.\nSOR subparagraph 3.g alleges Applicant provided false information about a vehicle inspection\nsticker to an investigative agent during a February 2006 interview. Applicant denied the allegation,\nthe agent did not testify, and the government did not present any documentary corroborating evidence.\nI find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR subparagraph 3.g.\nWhole Person Concept\nHaving lost his clearance several years ago because of security concerns generated by multiple\nalcohol-related charges and convictions, Applicant was well aware of the potential consequences of\nany future alcohol-related criminal activity. Nevertheless, he was arrested again for DUI in 2003. In\naddition to still being on probation for this offense, Applicant has more than $30,000 of delinquent\ndebt. Any reassurances he made at the hearing about changing his behavior were undermined by his\nsecurity clearance application falsifications. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole person\nconcept, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 - Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.g:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 22, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 31, 2007, after the hearing,\n\n2\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guidelines F and E had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuidelines F and E had not been mitigated, in that he gave insufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations at the hearing and the fact that Applicant had served honorably in the military for over\n24 years.  In support of his argument, Applicant offers new evidence which documents his\ncontinuing efforts to resolve his financial problems.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that\nthe Judge erred.\nThe Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Accordingly,\nwe may not consider Applicant\u2019s additional documentary evidence, and its submission does not\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless\nhe specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997).\nThe Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR Case\nNo. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 1992).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant\nactually mishandles or fails to properly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke\naccess to such information.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert.\ndenied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage\nin conduct that has negative security implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and\ncircumstances which are of security concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis\nto determine an applicant's security clearance eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined\nto the workplace. See ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (June 4, 2004).\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record\nevidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the Guideline F and E allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly\n\n3\ndisagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  He reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited\nby Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guidelines F and E\nis sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

She works for a defense\ncontractor in the health care industry.  She had income tax liabilities incurred as long ago as 1985\nbased on under withholding of her taxes.

She has now corrected her tax information, and mitigated the financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct trustworthiness concerns.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position\nis granted.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On October 30, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR\nin writing on November 13, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The\ncase was assigned to me on December 12, 2006.  On February 7, 2007, I convened a hearing to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\ntrustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits\nthat were admitted into evidence.  At the conclusion of the hearing, Applicant was given additional\ntime to submit exhibits.  Two exhibits were received and marked as Exhibits D and E without\nobjection from the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 61 years old, divorced since the early 1980s, and has five adult children, whom\nshe raised by herself.  All have college educations.  Applicant works for a defense contractor in the\nhealth care industry as a lead worker in her office area.  She has worked for this employer for the past\nthree years.  She rents an apartment and pays $342 monthly because she also works as a caretaker\nat the apartment building to keep her rent low.  Her caretaker work included painting a two-story\napartment building. (Tr. 34, 41, 42; Exhibits 1, 2, 3)\nApplicant lived with a friend who died suddenly in July 2006 at 85 years of age.  While they\nlived together he gave her money to pay his expenses and to pay his bills.  Applicant and her friend\nwent to casinos as recreation, but she no longer goes to them.  She has changed her lifestyle since\nhis death.  Her expenses are minimal because one of her daughters pays for her car insurance and\nrepairs in exchange for Applicant dog sitting her pet.  Applicant fully paid for her car, a 2002 model.\nShe has had no significant medical expenses in her life so far.  She has only basic television cable\nservice to save money.  Her cell phone is part of a family plan arrangement for which her daughter\npays the bill.  Applicant has no land-line telephone.  Applicant has no credit cards. (Tr. 32-35, 39;\nExhibit 2)\nIn the early 1980s, after her divorce, a co-worker of Applicant advised her to maintain her\nincome tax exemptions as she had while married.  She did so, and kept them even as her children\n\n4\nreached their majority and departed her home.  She consistently filed her tax returns each year.  The\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) and her state tax department discovered her exemptions exceeded\nwhat she was lawfully allowed to claim, and began to assess her back taxes in the late 1980s.  They\nalso sought to include the money her friend gave her as her additional income. Applicant owed\nadditional taxes for a number of tax years.  When she started her current job, she adjusted her\nexemptions and there are no current tax liabilities owed.  From the time the IRS started billing her\nfor unpaid taxes, Applicant has been paying $100 on an installment agreement while contesting the\nadditional income claims, penalties and interest that accumulated.  In 2002 her attorney\nrecommended she file Chapter 7 bankruptcy to rid herself of those and any taxes that could be\ndischarged.  She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2002, and was discharged in bankruptcy on\nSeptember 4, 2002.  Her debts were listed as $13,256, and her assets as $6,500.  She listed the 1989\nand 2000/2001 taxes in Schedules E and F of the bankruptcy.  Applicant thought her tax liabilities\nwere included in the bankruptcy, even as she continued to pay $175 monthly on the installment\nagreement for federal taxes.  She paid $50 monthly on her state tax lien.  She answered Question 20\n(Was she now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation) on her public trust\nposition questionnaire (PTPQ) with a negative answer.  She answered this way because she had been\npaying for years on her installment agreement and did not consider herself delinquent on any debt\non August 25, 2004, when she completed the PTPQ. (Tr. 19-28, 31, 37, 38, 46; Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4,\nC, D)\nApplicant\u2019s debts listed in the SOR are all IRS debts (Subparagraphs 1.b. to 1.i., 1.k. to 1.o.).\nOne debt ($893.84) was owed to her state tax authority (Subparagraph 1.j.), but she repaid that debt\nand the state tax lien was released on September 28, 2006.

That\npension amount is calculated presently at $419 monthly.  Applicant will apply all or part of this\nincome to further reduce her tax debt and increase her $100 monthly installment plan payments. (Tr.\n36; Exhibit E)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\n\n6\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nThe Concern. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead\nto financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\n\n7\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations.  All of Applicant\u2019s alleged delinquent financial\nobligations are tax debts, which she has been paying for many years.  She was willing and able to\npay these obligations, so they were not delinquent.  They arose through an error on her part in\nclaiming too many tax exemptions.  She has a history of meeting her financial obligations.  I\nconclude there are no Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that apply in this case under this Guideline.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct.  The SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified her\nanswer to Question 20 about delinquent debts more than 180 days past due when she completed the\nPTPQ in August 2004.  However, Applicant had been paying her tax debts for several years on a\nvalid installment payment agreement with the respective tax authorities.  Therefore, the tax\nobligations were not delinquent in the context that she had ignored paying any of the debt.  She also\nfiled Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002 to attempt to rid herself of some of the penalties and interest, and\ncertain taxes.  She relied on the advice given her by her tax attorney.  Applicant\u2019s presentation and\nexplanation of her actions is credible and persuasive.  I conclude there are no DCs that apply under\nthis Guideline because she told the truth as she knew it to be, and particularly because she had been\npaying regularly for years on her tax debt.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\" trustworthiness decision. Directive\nE2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case,\nI have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nApplicant\u2019s ignorance of the exemption requirements and calculations under the income tax\nlaws, and her good-faith reliance on her co-workers and attorney, resulted in her tax liabilities, dating\nback to 1985.  She has repaid a number of tax liabilities, and continues to work diligently to satisfy\nher debts.  The IRS and state tax authority have each released liens they filed because Applicant\nrepaid the tax debts.  Applicant corrected her exemption form and has not repeated her mistake.\nAlthough an adult when these errors occurred, she was naive and unsophisticated about the tax law\nrequirements.  She rehabilitated herself financially with the help of her late friend and daughter.  She\nleads a simple cash-based lifestyle with no frivolities.  Based on all of these factors, I conclude the\nfinancial considerations, personal conduct, and whole person analysis for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a. to 1.o.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Her\napplication for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On May 23, 2007, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding the\ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the trustworthiness concerns raised\nby his history of financial difficulties had not been mitigated because his indebtedness was due to\na circumstance beyond his control, loss of employment.  He also argues that the Judged erred with\nrespect to several of his findings.   The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.\n1\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nWe have considered the challenged findings in light of the record and conclude that they are\nbased on substantial evidence.  To the extent that there is error in the Judge\u2019s findings we conclude\nthat it is harmless.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings with respect to his conduct of trustworthiness concern do not reflect a reasonable or\nplausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the\nJudge\u2019s material findings of trustworthiness concern are sustainable. \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 05-03939 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 1, 2006).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still\nhad significant outstanding debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 05-16601 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJul. 2, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented\nin mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep.\n28, 2006).  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems in\nADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Murphy, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has been experiencing financial problems for many years. Determination of\nTrustworthiness is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care System Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I), entered into a Memorandum of\nAgreement which gave DOHA the responsibility to provide trustworthiness determinations for\ncontractor personnel employed in Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation\n5200.2R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987.\nOn August 31, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness,\nsuitability, and eligibility for applicant to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position (ADP-\nI/II/III).\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 2, 2006, and elected to have his case\ndetermined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel (DC) submitted the\nGovernment's written case (FORM) on or about February 14, 2007. Applicant filed a response to the\nFORM on or about April 5, 2007. The case was assigned to me on April 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 45 years of age.\nSOR Allegation 1a: Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in December 1996. The\npetition listed $94,895.07 in assets and $71,272.51 in liabilities. Applicant received a Discharge from\nthe bankruptcy court in April 1998.\nSOR Allegations 1b and 1c: Applicant is indebted to Capital One Bank for two credit card\naccounts in the total amount of $6,256.00. The accounts were charged off in September 2001.\nSOR Allegation 1d: Applicant is indebted to Verizon in the approximate amount of\n$1,363.00. The debt was charged off in 2002. \nSOR Allegation 1e: Applicant is indebted to Pinnacle in the approximate amount of\n$4,601.00. The debt was placed for collection in 2005.\nIn response to interrogatories sent to him in early 2006, applicant stated, with respect to each\nof the debts discussed above, that he had enrolled with Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS)\nto work out a debt payment plan, and that his first meeting with CCCS was scheduled for April 11,\n2006 (Exhibit 8).\nIn response to a second set of interrogatories sent to him a few months later, applicant stated,\nwith respect to each of the debts discussed above, that he had a meeting with CCCS, and due to\n\u201cinformation provided and the aging of these accounts,\u201d he was advised not to start a debt payment\n\n3\nplan. He further stated that he was seeking the services of an attorney to settle these accounts. A\nNovember 21, 2006 letter from an attorney indicates that applicant retained legal counsel to negotiate\na resolution of his debts (Exhibit 13).\nIn his response to the SOR, applicant stated that the four aforementioned delinquent debts\nwere the direct result of his loss of employment in 2001 and a divorce. In the FORM, DC noted that\napplicant did not indicate any break in employment since 1994 on his Public Trust Position\nApplication (PTPA) (Exhibit 5). In his response to the FORM, applicant responded to DC\u2019s\nargument by stating he lost his full time employment in November 2001, and did not obtain another\nfull time job until August 2002.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that within a few years of receiving his Discharge from the\nbankruptcy court, applicant began experiencing additional financial problems. His failure to honor\nnumerous financial obligations since receiving that Discharge in 1998 requires application of\nDisqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and\nE2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).\nApplicant stated that his post-bankruptcy financial difficulties were caused by a loss of\nemployment and a divorce.  Although his loss of employment in November 2001 and his divorce in\nApril 2002 may have contributed to his current financial problems, these financial problems began\nprior to these two events, as evidenced by the fact his Capital One Bank debts were charged off in\nSeptember 2001. Accordingly, Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.3 (the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control e.g., loss of employment . . . divorce) does not\napply.\nApplicant met with CCCS about a year ago to discuss his debts. According to applicant, he\nwas advised not to set up a payment plan because the debts were too old. Although applicant has\nevery right to accept this advice and not honor his financial obligations, his acceptance of this advice\ndoes not reflect well on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. On or before November 21,\n2006, he retained an attorney to help him negotiate settlements with his creditors. Although this\nappears to be a step in the right direction, this effort cannot be given much weight in light of the fact\nthere is no credible evidence that the attorney has contacted, let alone negotiated settlements with,\napplicant\u2019s creditors during the past four and one-half months. Based on the foregoing, applicant\ndoes not qualify for Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.4 (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control) or Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.6 (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nGiven applicant\u2019s long history of financial problems, and his inability or unwillingness to\ntake any meaningful action to address the four past-due debts alleged in the SOR, I have no choice\nbut to conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for applicant to have access to\nsensitive medical information.\n\n4\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability and\neligibility for applicant to hold a sensitive Information Systems Position.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

However, Applicant\u2019s December 2004 (Item 6)\nsworn statement failed to mention his wife\u2019s difficult pregnancy or illness. \nIn December 2004, Applicant was asked about his finances and he provided a sworn\nstatement in which he acknowledged a telephone bill ($149, SOR 1.a), two credit card debts ($1,666\nand $4,939, SOR 1.d and 1.e) and a mail order debt ($471, SOR 1.f). Applicant stated he did not\nintend to pay the finance company related to his truck loan ($12,927, SOR 1.b) because they failed\nto work with him to allow him to keep the truck. In November 2004, Applicant completed a personal\nfinancial statement (Item 7) in which he listed the two credit card debts, a Master Card debt, a\nstudent loan, and the mail order creditor.  The monthly payments would have totaled $325, which\n\n3\nif made, would have left him with a net remainder of a negative $268.86. There is no documentation\nthat payments were ever made on these accounts. \nIn March 2005, Applicant completed another personal financial statement (Item 9) which\ndid not reflect debt repayment except for his student loan ($25) and vehicle loan.  His monthly net\nremainder was $37.14. \nIn 2005, Applicant turned over the management of his financial affairs to his wife. Applicant\nasserts his spouse is negotiating with certain creditors about some of the delinquent debt.  Applicant\nfailed to document any of the negotiations.  Applicant asserts that since he turned over the running\nof their financial affairs to his wife, their bills have been current. \nAs of July 2007, Applicant and his spouse have net monthly income of $5,800, net monthly\nexpenses of $2,500, and $2,200 in monthly debt repayment, resulting in a net monthly remainder\nof $1,000. Applicant\u2019s home is valued at $247,000 on which he has mortgages of $243,000,\nresulting in equity of $4,000.  Applicant has $51,000 in other assets including savings, stocks, and\nbonds and $21,000 in other debt, which results in equity of $21,000.\nIn 2006, Applicant opened four new credit card accounts. (Item 12) Applicant\u2019s credit\nreports dated July 2004 (Item 10), March 2006 (Item 11), and March 2007 (Item 12) list ten past due\nor delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,600.  Half of the delinquent debt (approximately\n$13,000) is the result of a repossessed SUV/truck.

Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F, financial considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (Aff.. Bd. January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n5\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his\nfinances so as to meet his financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant denies four of the ten debts. Debts SOR 1.d ($1,666) and SOR 1.i ($2,026) are the\nsame debt. Applicant admits owing SOR 1.d and denies SOR 1.I, the same debt. Applicant denies\nthe vehicle repossession debt (SOR 1.b, $12,927).  He admits the vehicle was repossessed, but\nrefuses to pay the balance due because the creditor failed to work with him to allow him to keep the\nvehicle. Applicant admits owing six debts totaling approximately $8,400.  Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply. \nNone of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply in the Applicant\u2019s favor. MC 20 (a) the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment, does not apply because there are numerous debts and, even though the obligations\nwere not recently incurred, the delinquent debts remain. There is insufficient evidence to establish\nthe conduct is unlikely to recur.\n\n6\nIn July 2002, Applicant lost his $45,000 job due to downsizing.  He was asked about his\ndebts in December 2004 (Item 6). Applicant has been employed in his current job for three and a\nhalf years and has yet to show payment on a single bill.  He asserts his wife is now handling the\nfamily\u2019s finances and all the debts are current.  However, he provides no documentation supporting\nthis assertion. He also asserts his financial problems were contributed to by his wife\u2019s difficult\npregnancy and illness. Her pregnancy and illness may have had some impact on Applicant\u2019s\nfinances, but he failed to document the extent of the impact. \nSufficient time has passed since Applicant has obtained his current job to have made\npayment on at least one of the debts listed in the SOR.  I find MC 20 (b) the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, does not apply. Applicant has not acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\n There is no evidence Applicant has sought financial counseling nor has he demonstrated a\nchange in his financial management.  There no clear indication the problem is being resolved or\nunder control, even though Applicant asserts all his bills are now current and his wife now handles\nthe family finances.  MC 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, does not apply.\nMC 20 (d) applies when the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts to apply to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d\nto repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling\nhis debts is needed, which is not present here. \nApplicant disputes the amount owed in SOR 1.g ($737).  He says he will not repay the debt\narising from the repossession of his truck because the creditor did not work with him to allow him\nto keep the vehicle. However, Applicant\u2019s assertions, that the amount owed on one debt is incorrect\nand he did not like  the creditor\u2019s conduct, are insufficient to apply MC 20 (e) the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue.\nAffluence has not been alleged, therefore MC 20 (f) the affluence resulted from a legal\nsource of income, does not apply. Because he has failed to document payment of his debts, I find\nagainst Applicant on financial considerations.\nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the\nevidence in the context of the \u201cwhole person,\u201d I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcern based on financial considerations. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nClaude R.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 30, 2007, Administrative Judge\nShari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant submitted a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \n1\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision under Guidelines J and E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision under Guideline J should be\nreversed because: (a) a number of the criminal charges against him were dated and many had been\ndismissed; (b) a number of the incidents had resulted from marital or interpersonal difficulties that\nwere no longer present; (c) the most recent incident, a 2004 conviction for Reckless Driving, was\nnot serious; and (d) he had subsequently demonstrated rehabilitation under the whole person factors.\nSimilarly, he argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision under Guideline E should be\nreversed because the 2001 incident for misappropriation of time and allowing another person to enter\nhours in direct violation of company rules and policies was a dated, isolated incident, also mitigated\nunder the whole person factors.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nA Judge can find an applicant has engaged in criminal conduct even if the criminal charges\nagainst the applicant were dropped or dismissed.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-11906 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 19, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-21761 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 28, 2005).  The ultimate state court\ndispositions of Applicant\u2019s criminal incident did not preclude the Judge from making findings\nadverse to the Applicant.  Moreover, it was reasonable for the Judge to consider the significance of\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of conduct as a whole, rather than analyzing each separate criminal or personal\nconduct incident in a piecemeal fashion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct.\n20, 2006) citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F. 2d 860 (2  Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may\nnd\nhave a significance that is missing when each event is viewed in isolation).  Considering the record\nas a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern\nreflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence. \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.   The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions requires the exercise\nof sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740\nat 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\n\nThe charges against Applicant included Indecent Exposure, Domestic Assault, Disturbing the Peace, Reckless\n2\nDriving, Concealed Weapon, Brandishing a Firearm, Assault, Annoying Phone Calls, Worthless Check, Communicating\na Threat, Stalking, Violation of Probation, and Trespassing.\nDecision at 8.\n3\n3\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of criminal and\npersonal misconduct.  That history included 14 criminal incidents between 1990 and 2004.   In her\n2\ndecision, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors.  She specifically considered such mitigating\nevidence as Applicant\u2019s military service, his candid disclosures about his past conduct, the dismissal\nof cases, his remorse, and \u201chis current professional successes and aspirations, and enthusiasm for his\nnew family\u201d in reaching her decision.   She found in favor of Applicant with respect to some of the\n3\nSOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant\nhad presented in mitigation under Guidelines J and E was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that was before her,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines J and E is not arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 15,\n2007, setting the case for June 5, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1S6 into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified in his case.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nJune 14, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nPrior to commencing the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR and correct\na typographical error in Paragraph 1.r.  The motion was granted and number 1 was stricken from the\nparagraph and number 2 was inserted, such that the subparagraph now reads as follows:\nAs set forth in subparagraphs 2.c and 2.d below, you falsified your responses on two security\nclearance applications, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\nDepartment Counsel also moved to strike subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i from paragraph 2.d.  The\nmotion was granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 39 years old. He has been married to his second wife for about three years and has\ntwo children.  He has one child from his first marriage that ended in 1999.  He served on active duty\nin the U.S. Navy from July 1988 until October 1988.  He went on active reserve duty from January\n\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l involve the same offense.\n1\n3\n2000 until October 2000.  He was a data processing technician (E-5) at the time of his honorable\ndischarge.  Since leaving the service, he has been working as a consultant for federal contractors.  He\nhas held a secret security clearance since May 1988.  He is a full-time senior vice president at a local\nbank.  (Tr. 23). \nIn December 2001, Applicant began completing a SF-86 while at a former employer\u2019s office.\n(Tr. 24).  He did not fully complete it because he did not have all of the required information.  Shortly\nafter starting that application process, he located another position and the SF-86 was transferred to the\nnew position and he obtained an interim clearance.  However, unbeknownst to him the former\nemployer submitted the application.  (Tr. 25).  In April 2004, he submitted an undated SF-86.  (Tr. 25).\nFrom 1990 to March 2004, Applicant admitted that he was arrested and charged with 14\ncriminal violations.  They are as follows:\n(1) In 1990, he was charged with Indecent Exposure after he and some friends pulled\na prank, resulting in his arrest.  The case was later dismissed.  He was in his early twenties at\nthe time. (Tr. 27-29).\n(2) In June 1993, he was again charged with Indecent Exposure after he ran into the\nindividual involved in the 1990 charge.  He was found guilty and sent to counseling with the\nNavy. (Tr. 30).\n(3) In April 1995, he was charged with Domestic Assault after getting involved in an\nargument with his former wife.  The charge was dismissed. (Tr. 32).  \n(4) In August 1995, he was charged with Disturbing the Peace and Reckless Driving.\nHe was found guilty of Disturbing the Peace and fined; the Reckless Driving charge was\ndismissed. (Tr. 32-34).  \n(5) In November 1995, he was charged with having a Concealed Weapon and\nBrandishing Firearm.  He was moving out of his apartment when he became embroiled in an\nargument with his former wife\u2019s boyfriend.  The police were called and they found his gun (for\nwhich he had a permit).  The case was dismissed. (Tr. 35).  \n(6) In March 1996 he was charged with Assault after engaging in an argument with\nanother girlfriend.  It was dismissed.  (Tr. 36).\n(7) In April 1996, he was again charged with Assault and Annoying Phone Calls. The\ncharges arose out of incidents involving that same girlfriend. The charges were later dismissed.\n(Tr. 36).\n(8) In September 1996, he was charged with Article 91, Disrespect to a Chief Petty\nOffice, and Article 134, Communicating a Threat under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nHe was reduced to an E-1 rank and forfeited $580. (Tr. 39).\n(9) In April 1999, he was charged with Reckless Driving. This case was continued to\nNovember 1999.  In March 2000,  he was found guilty of speeding and fined $57. (Tr. 42; GX\n4 at 6).1\n(10) In April 2001, he was charged with Stalking his former girlfriend.  The case was\ndismissed.  (Tr. 43).\n(11) In April 2003, he was charged with Tresspassing after he went to his girlfriend\u2019s\nhouse to pick up some of his things and got into an altercation with her.  He was found guilty\nand incarcerated for 30 days (suspended) and fined $50. (Tr. 44-45).\n\n4\n(12) In August 2003, he was charged with Annoying Phone Calls and Disorderly\nConduct.  The Annoying Phone Calls charge was dismissed and he was found guilty on the\nDisorderly Conduct charge.  He was sentenced to four days in jail and placed on probation for\nsix months.  This incident arose after he again became embroiled with his girlfriend.  (Tr. 47-\n48).  \n(13) In November 2003, he was charged with Violation of Probation that was later\ndismissed when the court discovered the clerk\u2019s office had made an error regarding an appeal\nApplicant filed.  (Tr. 48-51; GX 4 at 11).\n(14) In March 2004, he was charged with Reckless Driving.  He was found guilty, fined\nand his license was placed in controlled status for two years, which required that he not receive\nany additional citations.  He was subsequently removed from that status in 2006.  (Tr. 51-52).\nApplicant admitted that in July 2001 he was disciplined by a former employer for\nmisappropriating time and allowing another individual to enter hours in violation of the company\npolicy.  He left the company in October 2001.\nOn the December 2001 SF-86, Applicant did not disclose the April 1995, August 1995,\nMarch 1996, April 1996 or April 1999 criminal charges in response to Question 26. Your Police\nRecord - Other Offenses: (In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted\nof any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? Leave out traffic fines of less than\n$150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.). He disclosed the Stalking incident and other\nadverse information under different questions.  He denied that he intentionally falsified his answers\nto the questions.  He asserted he could not fully complete it because he did not have the information\nwhen he sat down at the company\u2019s computer.  He was told he could return and complete it later;\nhowever, he never returned because he obtained another position.  He did not know the document\nwould be submitted.  (Tr. 55-56).  He also mistakenly believed that because he had previously given\na detailed summary of the 1990 incidents to an investigator, he need not be concerned about\ndisclosing all of the information again.\nIn April 2004, Applicant executed another SF-86.  In response to Question 26. Your Police\nRecord - Other Offenses: (In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted\nof any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? Leave out traffic fines of less than\n$150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.), he answered \u201cyes.\u201d. He disclosed three\noffenses under that question, but did not disclose the reckless driving charge from April 1999 or the\nViolation of Probation Charge that was dismissed in 2004.  He misinterpreted the question and did\nnot believe its disclosure was required because it was a traffic violation for which he was fined $57.\n(Tr. 59).  He did not list the Violation of Probation Charge because he did not consider it to be a\nvalid charge against him, having arisen as the result a clerical error in the court system, which was\ncorrected by its dismissal.  (Tr. 74).  He disclosed other adverse information throughout the SF-86.\nHe now clearly understands the government\u2019s requirement that each application be thoroughly\ncompleted as requested.\nApplicant acknowledges that his criminal history brings his character into question.  (Tr. 81).\nHowever, he believes he has matured over the years and is in a stable marriage and has a young\ninfant.  He has learned to exercise better judgment.  (Tr. 84). He has a good job and the potential for\ndeveloping a successful consulting business.  He candidly admitted that he received a speeding ticket\nrecently.  He was driving 60-mph in a 45-mph speed zone on the interstate.  (Tr. 71).\n\n5\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . .  that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at\n527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of all appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and pertinent legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth\nin the SOR:\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding criminal conduct stating,\n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.\u201d\nBased on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government established a\nsecurity concern under two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions: \u201ca single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses,\u201d and an \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d Guidelines 31(a) and (c).\nApplicant was arrested and charged with criminal misconduct on 14 separate occasions from\nNovember 1990 to March 2004.  Hence, he was convicted of multiple lesser offenses and admitted\nnumerous allegations of criminal conduct. \nAfter the Government raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations.  There are five Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under Guideline\n\nGuideline \u00b6 17(c) reads: \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient\n2\nfor an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation.\u201d\n6\n32.  I considered two of them.  Guideline \u00b6 32(a) provides mitigation when \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s last criminal arrest and charge occurred in March 2004, after which he was\nfined and his driver\u2019s license was placed in a controlled status for two years (to June 2006), about\none year ago.  Given his long history of criminal problems and his recent speeding ticket, sufficient\ntime has not elapsed since the last charge and this Guideline is not applicable.  Guideline \u00b6 32(d)\nrequires a showing that \u201cthere is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d Applicant\nprovided some evidence of mitigation under this Guideline.  He exhibited remorse for his conduct\nand provided evidence of his good employment record. However, there is not clear evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation, specifically in view of his recent speeding ticket in 2007 and its close\nproximity to his release from a controlled driving status within the past year.  \nThe Government contends that the allegations contained in SOR \u00b61.r pertaining to\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of the December 2001 and April 2004 SF-86s constituted a felony under\nfederal law.  Based on a determination set forth under Guideline E that he did not deliberately omit\ninformation, infra., I concluded he did not falsify his applications.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 15 articulates the Government\u2019s personal conduct concern, stating that \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that the criminal incidents listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.q\nraised a security concern under this Guideline.  After reviewing all of the Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Conditions, in particular Guideline 17(c) , I conclude it does not apply.  Those\n2\nallegations constitute the basis for a disqualification under Guideline J, as noted above, and therefore\ncannot be applied under this paragraph.  None of the other disqualifying conditions apply.  SOR \u00b6\n2.a is found in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nThe Government raised a Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition under Guideline \u00b6 16(d),\nas to the allegation contained in SOR \u00b6 2.b.  The security concern is based on \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by\nitself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\n\n7\n of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d In July 2001, Applicant was\ndisciplined by his former employer for conduct that involved dishonesty.\nAfter the Government raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut these allegations.  One of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions could potentially be\napplicable in this instance.  In order to trigger the application of Guideline \u00b6 17(c), there must be\nevidence that \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent,\nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  The job termination was in July\n2001, approximately six years ago, which constitutes the passage of a sufficient amount of time to\nwarrant some mitigation under this condition.\nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d that Applicant falsified his SF-86 in\nDecember 2001 and April 2004, by failing to disclose specific criminal arrests and charges, thereby\nconstituting a potential disqualification under Guideline \u00b6 16(a) that reads \u201cthe deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status determines security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Although Applicant admitted he did not disclose the\ninformation, he denied that he intentionally misled the government.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)\n(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nAt the time Applicant completed the security clearance application in December 2001, he did\nnot have all of the necessary information with him regarding his criminal history.  He disclosed what\nhe remembered throughout the SF-86 and intended on completing it later.  He also knew that many\nof the criminal incidents were previously disclosed in an earlier interview.  He was unaware that the\nincomplete form was submitted.  He admits he was confused by a question in the April 2004\napplication, but disclosed many other adverse incidents in the SF-86.  His explanation for not\ndisclosing essentially three incidents is plausible. I find his presentation and demeanor while\ntestifying on these issues lend credibility to his denial of any intention to falsify his SF-86s.  Hence,\nthe evidence does not establish deliberate falsification as alleged in \u00b6 2.c and \u00b6 2.d.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision.  The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d analysis. Directive \u00b6 E2.2. In evaluating the conduct of the applicant, an administrative judge\nshould consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\n\n8\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s age, his past military service, his demeanor while testifying and candid disclosure about\nhis criminal history, the cases that were dismissed, and remorse about his past.  I took into account\nthe fact that he has held a security clearance for a long period of time.  I also considered his current\nprofessional successes and aspirations, and enthusiasm for his new family.  However, the totality of\nthe evidence in this record supports his disqualification from having access to classified information.\nHe has been involved in 14 criminal incidents, several of them relating to interpersonal issues and\nothers involving traffic problems, including a 2007 speeding ticket.  He also had problems with one\nof his employers.  All of these incidents clearly demonstrate a pattern of criminal and personal\nmisconduct, which calls into question his judgment and willingness to comply with rules and\nregulations.  Although he appears to appreciate the gravity of these problems and their effect on his\ncareer potential, he has not gained sufficient insight into his actions that continuously raise questions\nabout his reliability and trustworthiness.  Until he takes additional steps to insure that his life is not\nspeckled with additional encounters with the law, and establishes a longer track record demonstrating\nthat, I suspect similar events may recur in the future. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all facts and circumstances, in\nthe context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by\nhis criminal and personal conduct.  The evidence leaves me with doubts as to his security eligibility\nand suitability.  Accordingly, Guideline J and Guideline E are concluded against him.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.aS1.j: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSupbaragraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.c - 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n  \nDECISION\n\n9\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Since 2001, he accumulated a\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nsignificant amount of debt that he has not paid or resolved. When he completed his security\nclearance application in December 2004, he did not disclose an automobile repossession and two\nunpaid judgments. He mitigated the security concerns raised by his personal conduct, but did not\nmitigate those raised by financial considerations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 30, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). On\nAugust 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR\ndetailed reasons under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct) why\nDOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.  DOHA recommended\nthe case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted.\nOn October 18, 2006, Applicant filed his Answer and elected to have the case decided on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. On April 25, 2007, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM), containing twelve Items, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on April\n27, 2007. Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material\nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on May 21, 2007, and timely\nsubmitted additional information without an objection from Department Counsel. I marked the\ndocuments as Applicant Exhibit (AX) A. The case was assigned to me on July 16, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 35 year- old security technician who works for a federal contractor. He began\nhis current position in November 2001. Prior to this job, he worked in private industry for seven\nyears. (Id. at 2). In December 2004, he completed a SCA. (Item 5).\nIn response to specific questions on the SCA, Applicant disclosed adverse information. He\nnoted a citation for a firearm\u2019s offense in response to Question 22. He included two wage\ngarnishments in response to Question 34. He listed a student loan that was more than 180 days\ndelinquent under Question 38 and a car loan that was more than 90 days delinquent under Question\n39. He did not disclose a November 2004 vehicular repossession under Question 35, or two unpaid\njudgments as requested in Question 37. (Item 5).\n\n3\nDuring a meeting with a government investigator in June 2005 regarding his finances and\nhis answers to the financial questions in the SCA, Applicant acknowledged various debts. He was\nnot able to pay his debts because he was supporting his father and paying his mortgage through a\nbankruptcy proceeding. (Item 6 at 1 & 7). He denied having knowledge of any judgment entered\nagainst him. (Id. at 1). He believed his debts totaled approximately $9,000-10,000 in June 2005. (Id.\nat 6). He also submitted a budget indicating a total net monthly income of $2,400 and expenses of\n$1,000, leaving approximately $860 for other expenses. The only delinquent debt listed on the\nbudget was a garnishment for his student loan. (Item 7). Credit reports confirm his financial\nproblems began in 2001. (Items 9 & 10). \nIn August 2006, the Government filed a SOR. Paragraph 1 of the SOR alleged that\nApplicant\u2019s fifteen delinquent debts totaled $12,358. In his Answer, Applicant admitted owing all\nof the debts. He asserted that he entered into a debt management agreement to pay six debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.k), and that he was making monthly payments on them. (Item 4; AX A at 3).\nHe located another debt management company to handle the debts noted in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1e, and 1.m.\n(AX A at 3). He submitted proof of payment for \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l, which was the same debt. (AX A at\n4). The debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.n, 1.o, have been paid, albeit through garnishments. (Item 12).\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he did not answer Question 35 correctly\n\u201cbecause [he] honestly overlooked item 35, resulting in the repossession not be [sic] listed on the\nclearance application.\u201d (Item 4 at 3). He failed to include two judgments under Question 37 because\nhe was unaware of them when he completed the SCA. (Item 6). Applicant reiterated in his response\nthat after he started taking care of his elderly father in 2002, including his finances, he began\nexperiencing his additional financial difficulties. (AX A at 4).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information, sets forth criteria, which must be evaluated when determining security\nclearance eligibility. Within those adjudicative guidelines are factors to consider in denying or\nrevoking an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and\nfactors to consider in granting an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Mitigating\nConditions). By recognizing that individual circumstances of each case are different, the guidelines\nprovide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to\nreach a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nThe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision. Section E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all\nappropriate variables in a case as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the disqualifying and\nmitigating conduct an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n4\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must\ninclude consideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also\nconsideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information. Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2. The\ndecision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a judgment about an applicant\u2019s\nloyalty. Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 7. Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. Departments of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988). The Directive presumes a rational connection between past proven conduct under any\ndisqualifying conditions and an applicant's present security suitability. ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at\n2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\ncorresponding burden of rebuttal shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nclearance.\u201d Id.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and after application of the appropriate\nadjudicative factors and pertinent legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nGuideline F articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \u201cA security\nconcern may exist when an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Failure to live within one\u2019s means and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000).\nBased on the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), apply to this case. Since 2001, Applicant has a history of being\nunable to meet his financial obligations as evidenced by his admissions and credit reports.\nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those two FC DC, the burden shifted\nto Applicant to produce evidence of mitigating condition. Five Financial Considerations Mitigating\n\n5\nConditions (FC MC) are potentially applicable. Because Applicant\u2019s financial troubles began in\napproximately 2001 and continued to the present, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not\nrecent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (It was an isolated incident) are not applicable. Applicant claimed\nhe was unable to pay some of his delinquent debts because he was helping his elderly father manage\nhis finances and paying his mortgage. Such monetary assistance is sufficient to provide some\nmitigation under FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The condition that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control). However, there is no evidence that Applicant participated in\ncounseling for his financial difficulties or that the problems are resolved or under control, as required\nby FC MC E2.A.6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). The record\ncontains proof that five debts are paid. Applicant asserted that he was managing the other debts\nthrough consolidation payment plans. Although he submitted a letter from one company\nacknowledging an agreement, he did not submit any evidence to verify his compliance with the\nagreement or the balance owed on the debts covered by the agreement. Nor did he submit evidence\nof the additional repayment plan he recently negotiated. Thus, he did not provide sufficient\ndocumentary evidence to trigger full application of FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nGuideline E articulates the Government\u2019s concern under personal conduct. \u201cA security\nconcern may exist when conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that\nthe person may not properly safeguard classified information.\u201d \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2. a and 2.b that Applicant falsified his SCA by failing\nto disclose an automobile repossession and two unpaid judgments, which established a\ndisqualification under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (The\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities). Applicant asserted that his failure\nto disclose the repossession was an oversight and that he was unaware of the unpaid judgments.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17,\n2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004).\nApplicant disclosed a delinquent automobile loan in response to Question 39 on the SCA.\nThat disclosure, along with the other adverse information he provided under Questions 22, 34 and\n38, demonstrates his intention to be truthful in completing his SCA, and corroborate his explanations\nthat the omission of information was negligent and not intentional. Hence, the evidence does not\nestablish deliberate falsification. This Guideline is found in his favor.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\n\n6\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Directive. Although\nApplicant made some progress in resolving the SOR debts and asserted a commitment to paying the\nothers, he failed to provide evidence that he has addressed the remaining ten debts. He is 35 years\nold, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his obligations. His decision to incur more debt\nthan he could manage over the last several years was voluntary. While I recognize the value of the\nassistance he provided to his father, his decision to abandon his obligations without a repayment\nplan, exhibited poor judgment. Until he establishes a budget documenting his repayment plans and\na track record of consistent financial management, which demonstrates reliability and good\njudgment, I am concerned that he will continue having financial difficulties, despite assertions to the\ncontrary.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and all facts in the context of the\nwhole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial\nconsiderations. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified\ninformation at this time.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.

On December 11, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason,\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.   Applicant submitted a timely appeal\n1\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his Standard Form 85P was deliberate and intentional; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that he did not deliberately and intentionally falsify his Standard Form 85P\nby failing to disclose two debts that had been outstanding for over 180 days.  It is Applicant\u2019s\ncontention that the omission of the information in question was due to an honest mistake and was\nat most careless.  In support of that contention, Applicant states that he did not know that there were\noutstanding debts that were over 180 days past due, and that he made no inquiries concerning his\ndebts and did not have access to any credit reports at the time.    Applicant\u2019s argument does not\n2\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was\ndeliberate and intentional. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-06602 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 6, 2007).  On this\nrecord, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nApplicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s conclusion in that regard is arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.   \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-01181 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nJan. 30, 2004). \nIn this case, the Judge reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions.  The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor under one of the Guidelines.  However, the Judge\nreasonably explained why there was insufficient mitigating evidence to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by the Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s overall decision is\n\n3\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-08653 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14,\n2007).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness\ndetermination under Guidelines E and J is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted thirteen allegations and denied one. She offered mitigating circumstances. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. Applicant is 51 years old. She is a high school graduate and has completed approximately one year of college. She was married in 1975 and divorced in 1981. She has no children.

At her hearing, while she was sometimes vague\nor imprecise about the current status of her financial obligations, she demonstrated that she had made\nprogress in paying or arranging to pay some of her debts.  While Applicant\u2019s recent efforts to satisfy\nher creditors are laudable, they are not a substitute for a consistent record of timely remedial action.\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, of the\nDirective.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On July 24, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and Department of\n1\nDefense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge.  The case was assigned to me September 28, 2006.  On November 20, 2006, I\nconvened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government called no witnesses and submitted five\nexhibits (Ex.) for admission to the record  (Ex. 1 through 5.)  The Government\u2019s exhibits were\nadmitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf and called four\nadditional witnesses.  She submitted six exhibits, which were identified as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A through\nF and admitted to the record without objection.  On December 8, 2006, DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) of the proceeding.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains fourteen  allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted thirteen allegations and denied one.\nShe offered mitigating circumstances. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. \nApplicant is 51 years old.  She is a high school graduate and has completed approximately one\nyear of college.  She was married in 1975 and divorced in 1981.  She has no children.  Since January\n2005, Applicant has been employed as a receptionist by a government contractor.  She has not\npreviously held a security clearance.  She receives an hourly salary of $18.99 and is paid once a month.\nShe estimates her monthly net income is between $2,200 and $2,400.  (Ex. 1; Tr.27-29, 55, 104-106.)\nSince about 1995, Applicant has been residing with a woman she considers to be her very close\nfriend.  The two women shared rent, utilities, and other household expenses.  In about May or June of\n\n3\n2001, Applicant\u2019s friend was diagnosed with and treated for lung cancer.  The friend has not worked\nsince June 2001, and, beginning in about December 2001 or January 2002, she has received\napproximately $1,000 per month in disability pay.  (Tr. 116, 130-131.)\nFor the six-month period between June 2001 and January 2002, Applicant paid all rent,\nutilities, and household expenses for herself and her friend.  (Tr. 131.)  Since she began receiving\nmonthly disability payments in about January 2002, the friend pays one half of the rent and groceries\nand Applicant pays the utilities.  (Tr. 137-140.)\nIn April 2004, Applicant was laid off from her job as a sales consultant with an automotive\ndealer.  She collected unemployment compensation and began her present job in January 2005.  (Ex.\n1; Tr. 46-47.)  \nApplicant dates her financial problems to her friend\u2019s illness in May or June of 2001 and to her\nloss of her job in April 2004.  (Tr. 31-32.)  In January 2005, Applicant executed and signed a security\nclearance application (SF-86).  In the General Remarks section of her SF-86, Applicant stated:\n\u201cCurrently I have a negative credit history that I am looking forward to correcting as soon as possible.\u201d\n(Ex. 1 at 8.).   \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted indebtedness to creditors for two judgments\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.), five accounts placed for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.n. , five\ncharged off accounts (SOR \u00b6 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.l., and 1.m.), and a returned check (SOR \u00b6 1.i.).  She\nacknowledged a judgment entered against her in February 2000 for $1,309 (SOR \u00b6 1.c.), but she denied\nresponsibility for the debt and said she was contesting it.  She presented no evidence to support her\nclaim she was contesting the debt.  (Tr. 67.)\nApplicant admitted her wages were garnished beginning in July 2002 on a judgment entered\nagainst her in June 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) and the judgment remained unsatisfied.  (Tr. 96-97.)\nIn July 2005, Applicant sought assistance from a consumer credit counseling service.  She\nagreed to pay the consumer credit counseling service $157 per month to pay off debts identified at \u00b6\u00b6\n1.f., 1.l., 1.j., 1.m., and 1.n. of the SOR. (Ex. 2 at pages numbered 57 through 61.)  Applicant presented\nevidence she had participated in consumer credit counseling provided to her by the credit counseling\nservice.  (Ex. D.) \nIn April 2006, Applicant filed a revised budget with DOHA showing the judgment alleged at\n\u00b6 1.a. of the SOR had also been turned over to the credit counseling service for payment.  (Ex. 3.)  At\nher hearing, Applicant stated several payments had been made to the judgment creditor but she did not\nknow what the balance due on the debt was.  (Tr. 64.)  She stated the judgment alleged at \u00b61.b. of the\nSOR was less than $4,000 and remained unsatisfied.  (Tr. 66.)\nApplicant presented a letter from a creditor stating that the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.d. had been paid\nin full as of November 4, 2006, provided her payment check was not returned by the bank.  She had\nno proof her payment had cleared the creditor\u2019s bank.  (Ex. C; Tr. 67-69.)\nApplicant asserted she was unable to pay the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.e. because the creditor no\nlonger existed.  (Tr. 71-73.)  She also acknowledged that approximately $147 was the current balance\n\n4\ndue on the debt of $197 alleged at \u00b6 1.f.  (Ex. 5; Tr. 73-74.)  Applicant acknowledged owing two\nseparate debts to the same creditor, one of which was being paid and the other which was not.  She was\nunable to determine whether the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.g. was the debt being paid by the consumer credit\ncounseling service on her behalf. (Tr. 75-76.)\nApplicant\u2019s testimony regarding the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.h. was confusing.  She asserted the debt\nwas the same as the debt alleged at 1.l. of the SOR and the creditor was no longer in existence.  She\nalso stated she was in negotiation with the creditor to determine a settlement amount. (Tr. 45, 76-78.)\nApplicant acknowledged the debts alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.i., 1.j., and 1.k., 1.m., and 1.n. had not been\nsatisfied.  ( Tr. 78-87; Ex. F.)  She also acknowledged opening at least two new credit accounts and\nowing several hundred dollars in payments. (Tr. 87-90.)\nIn preparation for her hearing, Applicant consulted a financial advisor recommended by her\ncounsel.  The financial advisor testified as an expert witness at the hearing.  He said he customarily\ncharged an hourly fee of $150 for his services.  He said he had consulted with and advised Applicant\nfor approximately four hours, and he would likely charge her his customary fee for his services.  (Tr.\n147-150.)\nApplicant presented two letters on her behalf submitted by her supervisors.  Both supervisors\npraised Applicant\u2019s professionalism and job skills.  (Ex. A, Ex. B.)  Additionally, Applicant\u2019s current\nsupervisor appeared as a witness and testified positively about Applicant\u2019s skills and abilities.  (Tr.\n172-174.) \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[No one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\n\nGuideline F Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. reads: \u201cA history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n3\nDC E2.A6.1.2.3. reads: \u201cInability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d\nGuideline F Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. reads: \u201cThe behavior was not recent.\u201d MC E2.A6.1.3.2.\n4\nreads: \u201cIt was an isolated incident.\u201d\n5\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2013Financial Considerations\nThe Government\u2019s concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals\nwho are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay their just debts may try to generate\nfunds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, and\nshe has not demonstrated a willingness to take control of her financial situation and satisfy her debts\nin a consistent and organized manner.  These conditions raise security concerns under subparagraphs\nE2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.  DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has concluded that \u201c[a] person\nwho is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment\nand reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 98-0810\nat 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000).\nThe Government has established, through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence,\na prima facie case that Applicant is financially overextended.  At her hearing, Applicant was vague\nand unclear about the status of several of her current financial responsibilities.  While she presented\nevidence of financial counseling, she appeared to have no plans in place to timely satisfy her creditors\nand avoid financial delinquency in the future.  She provided no persuasive evidence to rebut the\nfinancial concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions under \u00b6\u00b6\nE2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.3\nSeveral conditions specified under Guideline F could mitigate the security concerns raised by\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies.  Applicant\u2019s acknowledged delinquencies date to at least 2000\nand 2001.  Her financial delinquencies involve long-standing debts, and her inability or unwillingness\nto pay them is recent.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor mitigating condition\nE2.A6.1.3.2. applies.4\n\nMC E2.A6.1.3.3. reads: \u201cThe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n5\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation.)\u201d\n6\nWhen she filed her SF-86 nearly two years ago, Applicant expressed her desire to correct her\nnegative credit history as soon as possible.  At the time of her hearing, many of her debts remained\nunsatisfied, and Applicant had no comprehensive plan in place to timely resolve her financial\ndelinquencies.  In determining an individual\u2019s security worthiness, the Government cannot rely on the\npossibility that the applicant might resolve his or her outstanding debts at some future date.\nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s friend, with whom she resides, fell ill in May or June 2001\nand was unable to help with household expenses until her disability payments commenced in\napproximately January 2002.  Applicant attributed her financial problems to her friend\u2019s illness and\ninability to work and to her own period of unemployment between April 2004 and January 2005, and\nshe cited these as conditions that were largely beyond her control.\nIf a person\u2019s financial delinquencies were largely caused by conditions beyond his or her\ncontrol, then mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3  might apply.  Assessing the applicability of this\n5\nmitigating condition often requires a two-part analysis.  First, an administrative judge must review and\nweigh the existing evidence to determine if the applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose from\ncircumstances outside of  his or her control.  Second, assuming that some or all of the circumstances\nwere beyond the individual\u2019s control, the judge may consider whether the applicant acted in a\nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.  See e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0462\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1., 1999).\nIn assessing the applicability of mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. in Applicant\u2019s case, I note\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems pre-dated her friend\u2019s illness and incapacity and her own eight-month\nperiod of unemployment.  She has now been steadily employed for about two years and presented no\ncredible evidence that once she was re-employed, she devised a consistent and workable plan to\nidentify and satisfy her many long-term debts and financial delinquencies.  While she turned some of\nher debts over to a credit counseling service for payment, she allowed others to remain unsatisfied. \nApplicant\u2019s devotion to and support of her friend during a difficult time was admirable and\nher own period of unemployment was unfortunate.  However, these unexpected conditions do not\nentirely explain or mitigate her long-standing financial difficulties and her unwillingness to approach\nmany of her creditors and arrange payment or settlement.  Her present financial problems do not appear\nto be primarily the result of conditions beyond her control.  Thus, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3.\napplies only in part.\nTo her credit, Applicant presented evidence that she had received consumer financial credit\ncounseling to help her manage her financial problems.  However, she failed to demonstrate that the\nconsumer credit counseling had an impact on her ability to timely resolve her financial problems or\nto bring them under control.  Therefore, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.4. applies only in part.  While\nshe presented evidence she had a payment plan in place to satisfy some of her debts, her lack of precise\nknowledge of the status of her remaining obligations did not persuade me she had a concrete plan to\nresolve her financial delinquencies.  Accordingly, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.6. is also\ninapplicable, and the Guideline F allegations in the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.\n\n7\nWhole Person Analysis\nParagraph E2.2 of the Directive requires that the adjudicative process in a security clearance\ncase not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered\nin a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct (E2.2.1.1); the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation (E2.2.1.2); the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct (E2.2.1.3); the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct (E2.2.1.4.); the voluntariness of participation (E2.2.1.5.); the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes (E2.2.1.6); the motivation for the conduct\n(E2.2.1.7); the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (E2.2.1.8.); and, the likelihood\nfor continuation or recurrence (E2.2.1.9).\nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay her debts over a period of many years raises serious security\nconcerns.  Applicant, a high school graduate with approximately one year of college education, was\na mature woman with many years of life experience when she allowed her debts to spiral out of\ncontrol.  In January 2005, she acknowledged on her SF-86 that she had a poor credit history which she\nintended to rectify as soon as she could.  To her credit, she sought financial counseling; however, she\nfailed to put her knowledge to good use by developing a plan to resolve all of her financial\ndelinquencies.  Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to acknowledge and carry out her legal duties to pay her just\ndebts suggests she may not take her legal duty to protect classified information seriously.  Her current\nsituation suggests her financial difficulties are likely to continue.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security\nclearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past\ntransgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common\nsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed,\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and\nomissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude Applicant\nshould not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the\nevidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of Defense\nDirective, 5220.6., as amended. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.:  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 14, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 19, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\n\n2\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised by\nhis history of financial difficulties were mitigated because his financial problems were largely the\nresult of circumstances beyond his control\u2014a period of underemployment\u2014and he has received\ncounseling, established a repayment plan, begun to repay the debts, and maintained consistent\nemployment.  In support of his argument, Applicant essentially reargues his case with respect to the\nevidence he presented below and provides additional explanations as to what efforts he has taken\nto resolve his remaining outstanding debts.  Applicant also argues that an adverse clearance decision\ncould possibly jeopardize his current employment and his future employment possibilities.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \n(1) An applicant\u2019s need for a security clearance to keep his job is not material to the\nevaluation of his security suitability.  The possibility that an unfavorable clearance decision could\nhave adverse consequences for an applicant\u2019s job situation is not relevant or material to an evaluation\nof the security significance of that applicant\u2019s situation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-21070 at 4\n(App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2004).  The security significance of Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties\nis not diminished or reduced by the fact that an unfavorable security clearance decision could result\nin the loss of his job.\n(2) The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nAccordingly, we may not consider Applicant\u2019s additional explanations, and they do not demonstrate\nerror on the part of the Judge.\n(3) The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a\nfinding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the financial considerations allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly\ndisagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision he still had\nsignificant outstanding debts and had only recently begun to repay his debts.  In light of the\n\n3\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent, not\nisolated, and still ongoing.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the\nrecord that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F\nis sustainable.  Thus, the Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin      \nJean E.

On two separate occasions, he deliberately falsified material facts\nregarding his illegal drug use on his security clearance applications. He failed to accurately state the\namount of marijuana, cocaine, hallucucinogenics, and acid, he used during the previous 25 years.\nIn 2003, he was denied access to Sensitive Compartmented Information by another government\nagency due to his illegal drug use while holding a security clearance and for providing discrepant\ninformation regarding his use of drugs.

On\n1\nNovember 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or revoked.\nIn a written statement, dated November 19, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested an in-person hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 1, 2007.\nA Notice of Hearing was issued on February 10, 2007, scheduling the hearing for February 28, 2007.\nThe hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the government offered six exhibits, Exs.\n1-6, and Applicant offered one exhibit, Ex. A. All exhibits were accepted into the record without\nobjections. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all the allegations under Guideline E, personal conduct and Guideline J,\ncriminal conduct. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 49 years old and was a self-employed entrepreneur from 1990 until his firm was\nacquired by a federal defense contractor.  At the height of his flourishing technology business, he\n2\ncreated more than 250 jobs.  He currently works as a vice president for a defense contractor.  In 1982\n3\n4\nhe received a master\u2019s degree in industrial engineering  from a state university.  In January 1995, he\n5\n\nEx. 3 (Security Clearance Application, dated September 18, 2002).\n6\nTr. 29.\n7\nEx. 4, supra, note 11.\n8\nEx. 2 (Sworn Statement of Subject, dated September 25, 2001).\n9\n4\nreceived a Secret clearance.  He received a Top Secret clearance in January 2001. He was married\n6\nin 1983 and has six children, aged 23 to 11.7\nApplicant\u2019s involvement with illegal substances has been extensive, spanning 25 years, when\nhe was between the ages of approximately 18 and 43.  During this period, he used marijuana,\n8\ncocaine, hallucucinogenics, and acid. Much of his illegal drug involvement took place during times\nin his life when he had been entrusted with a government security clearance at both the Secret and\nTop Secret levels.\nWhen he executed his SF 86 on August 23, 2001, in response to question 27 (Your Use of\nIllegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,\nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana,\ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.),amphetamines,\ndepressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\n prescription drugs?), he failed to disclose the following: (1) he used marijuana from 1994 to at least\nAugust 2001, and (2) he used marijuana approximately once per week in 1994 and approximately\ntwice per week from 1995 to August 2001.\nIn a signed, sworn statement, dated September 25, 2001, to an authorized investigator of the\nDepartment of Defense, he falsified material facts in that he stated that he had used marijuana very\noccasionally over the previous 10 years. He indicated that he used marijuana most recently in about\n2000 at a concert, he did not use any other illegal drugs, had not bought illegal drugs, and had no\nplans to use illegal drugs in the future. In truth, he failed to indicate: (1) he used marijuana, with\nvarying frequency to include two times per week, to at least September 2001; (2) he purchased\nmarijuana; and (3) he used cocaine from 1992 to 1993. He also stated the following regarding his\nuse of marijuana:\nI do not use any drugs, medical or illegal. I am a Christian man raising 6 children.\nHowever, over the last 10 years I have been in the presence of, and very occasionally\npuffed on marijuana.9\nOn January 6, 2003, he executed another SF 86, and in question 27 (the same question as that\nin the 2001 SF 86) asking about his use of illegal drugs, he failed to disclose the following:  (1) he\nused marijuana, approximately two times per week, from 1996 to at least September 2001, and (2)\nhe used marijuana while possessing a security clearance, granted on March 10, 1995.\n\nTr. 33; Exs. 1 and 3.\n10\nTr. 34.\n11\nEx. 4 (Clearance Decision Statement, dated October 1, 2003).\n12\nEx. 4 , supra, note 11; Ex. 5 (Notification of Denial of Access to SCI - Information Memorandum, dated\n13\nOctober 16, 2003); Ex. 6 (Final Outcome of Appeal Case Memorandum, dated April 28, 2004).\nTr. 39-40.\n14\n5\nApplicant testified that he understated his use of drugs in both SF 86s.  When he was\n10\nquestioned as to whether he made false statements to the government, he testified:\nNot intentionally false statements. That\u2019s not the way it happened. I didn\u2019t sit there\nand lie or say oh, I think I\u2019m going to lie to the Government. It \u2013 it \u2013 you lie to\nyourself  in these matters. And then, through the course of this, almost like\ncounseling you end up kind of getting clear on everything. I did not intentionally lie.11\nOn October 11, 2001 and January 6, 2003,  Applicant was interviewed for a security\n12\nclearance by a representative of NSA (National Security Agency) Associate Directorate for Security\nand Counterintelligence. During the first interview, he elaborated on his drug use. At the 2003\ninterview, he revised the number of times he used marijuana. From 1995 to September 2001, he used\nmarijuana approximately twice per week. He purchased it on approximately 10 occasions during that\ntime period, paying no more than $40 per purchase. When confronted with his use of illegal drugs\nwhile holding government clearances, Applicant stated \u201cthat he understood the policies prohibiting\ninvolvement with illegal drugs, but he didn\u2019t think the policies were \u2018serious.\u2019\u201d\nAs a result of both his 2001 and 2003 interviews with NSA, in 2003, Applicant was denied\naccess to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) due to his illegal drug use while holding a\nsecurity clearance and for providing discrepant information.  This decision was affirmed on April\n13\n28, 2004.\nAt the hearing, Applicant stated the following about of use of illegal drugs during the past\n25 years:\nWhen you\u2019re talking about personal drug use and you\u2019re a father of six and you\u2019re\nrunning a company and you\u2019re a leader in your community, these \u2013 types of things\nto the Federal Government is shameful. It is embarrassing. And \u2013 and an intelligent\nmind can concoct all kinds of reasons and rationale and all kinds of things to not\nreveal this because of the shame and embarrassment.14\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of answers on his SF 86s, sworn statement, and interviews with\nNSA, could all be considered criminal activity, which constitutes a violation of federal law, Title 18,\nUnited States Code, Section 1001, a felony.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n15\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n16\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n17\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n20\nId.\n21\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n22\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n23\n6\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n15\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n16\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n17\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.18\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.19\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n20\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n21\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n22\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n23\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question whether the\nperson\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified\ninformation. The government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline\nE, personal conduct.\nOn two separate occasions, in 2001 and 2003, Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and\nmaterial facts in his SF 86. In 2001 and 2003, he was interviewed by NSA. He finally divulged the real\nextent of his drug use at the 2003 interview. Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC\nDC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities), E2.A5.1.2.3 (deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator,\nsecurity official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a\npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination), E2.A5.1.2.4 (personal conduct or concealment\nof information that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such\nas engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail), and E2.A5.1.2.5 (a pattern of\ndishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between\nthe individual and the agency) all apply here. None of the applicable Personal Conduct Mitigating\nConditions apply. Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegations 1.a\nthrough 1.e of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.\nCriminal Conduct\nCriminal Conduct is always a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a persons judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The government has\nestablished a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline J, criminal conduct.\nThe allegations under a criminal conduct security concern focus solely on the false statements\nApplicant provided in his SF 86s signed in 2001 and 2003, and his signed, sworn statement in 2001.\nApplicant\u2019s involvement with illegal substances has been extensive, and it has spanned a period of 25\nyears, when he was between the ages of approximately 18 and 43. While in college, he purchased\nmarijuana, spending between $20 and $40 three times per year between 1977 and 1982. He last\npurchased illegal drugs in 1989. On a less frequent basis, he used halluciongenic mushrooms, cocaine,\nand acid. Much of his illegal drug involvement took place during times in his life when he had been\nentrusted with a government security clearance at both the Secret and Top Secret levels. He repeatedly\nlied to the government about his drug use. Although he testified he stopped using drugs in September\n2001, there is no evidence to support his contention. Moreover, because he lied so much about his past\ndrug use, I did not find him credible. Even, arguendo, that he stopped using illegal drugs in 2001, I\ndo not think that lying in three documents to the government to process his security clearance, warrants\n\n8\na clearance because he has been drug-free for five years. This is not a case of being rehabilitated from\ndrug use. This case involves Applicant lying to the government about his past drug use. It was not until\ninterviews with NSA in 2003 that he found courage to tell the truth about 25 years of illegal drug use.\nI commend his five years of being drug-free. However, his lying caused him to lose his access to SCI\nin October 2003 and that decision was affirmed on April 28, 2004. Thus, I cannot conclude that\nApplicant is willing to tell the truth, without prompting. Consequently, Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Conditions (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (allegations or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate the criminal conduct security concern. Applicant has failed to\ntruthfully convey the extent of his drug use to the government while his applications were being\nprocessed for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs spanned almost 25 years, and\nincluded the illegal use of marijuana, halluciongenic mushrooms, cocaine, and acid. The record is\ndevoid of Applicant being involved in any recent use of illegal drugs. However, not only has Applicant\nfailed to disclose the extent of his illegal drug use and the period of time he used drugs, he provided\ncontradictory information in his two SF 86s and his sworn statement. It was not until June 2003, that\nhe provided a complete picture of his drugs use to an agent of another government agency. As a result\nof the information provided in his June 2003 interview, he was denied access to SCI. Moreover, that\ndecision was sustained on appeal. Thus, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC)\nE2.A10.1.3.1 (the criminal behavior was not recent), CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (the crime was an isolated\nincident), CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3 (the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are not longer present in that person\u2019s life),CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 (the person did not\nvoluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur), and CC\nMC E2.A10.1.3.6 (there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) do not apply. Applicant has not\nmitigated the government\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegation 2.a of the SOR is concluded against\nApplicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. At age 49,\nhe is highly educated and has been an entrepreneur in business, having run his own company for 15\nyears. Moreover, as a businessman, he was astute enough to sell his business to a company that is well-\nknown in the federal contracting business. However savvy he might be in business, Applicant is naive\nabout how his lying about his illegal use of drugs, which could negatively impact on his future career\nendeavors. The allegations under criminal conduct focus solely on the false statements he provided in\ntwo SF 86s and his signed, sworn statement. Much of his illegal drug involvement took place during\ntimes in his life when he had been entrusted with a government security clearance at both the Top\nSecret and Secret levels. This is not a case of being rehabilitated from drug use. This case involves\nApplicant lying to the government about his past drug-use. It was not until interviews with NSA that\nhe found courage to tell the truth about 25 years of illegal drug use. Moreover, he lost access to SCI\nbased on lying and discrepancies found in his many statements. Based on the evidence of record,\nhowever, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nFor the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
