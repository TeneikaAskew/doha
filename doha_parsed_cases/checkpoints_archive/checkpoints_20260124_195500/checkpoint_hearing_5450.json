RICCIARDELLO\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nApplicant is 38 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since May 2005. He has a\nlong history of financial delinquencies and criminal conduct. He deliberately failed to disclose the\nextent of his delinquent debts and criminal conduct. Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns\nraised under Guideline F, financial considerations, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E,\npersonal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations),\nGuideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct).\nIn a sworn statement dated December 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations except SOR 1.k and 3.a, which he denied. Applicant elected\nto have his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file\nof relevant material (FORM) on January 29, 2007. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on the same\nday and received on February 12, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not provide a response. The\ncase was assigned to me on March 28, 2007. \nPROCEDURAL ISSUE\nThe SOR alleges in subparagraph 3.b that Applicant failed to disclose information about his\ncriminal offenses as set forth in \u201csubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b.\u201d It appears this allegation has a\ntypographical error and should read \u201csubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b.\u201d Applicant admitted the allegations\nin SOR 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b. The narrative of the allegations explains specifically what question on\nthe Security Clearance Application (SCA) Applicant failed to provide information. I find Applicant\nwas not misled and there was sufficient notice of the allegation. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 38 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since May 2005. He was\nmarried from 1988 to 1992. He divorced and remarried in 2001. He has one child and one stepchild.\n\nAnswer; GE 6.\n2\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n3\n3\nApplicant has approximately $42,266 in delinquent debts listed in the SOR that he admits he owes.\nHe denies the debt in SOR 1.k for $35. He stated in his answer that he paid the debt in SOR 1.a, a\nstate tax lien. He failed to provide documentation and the debt is still listed on his credit report.  He\n2\nowes a debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxes due in 1996. He stated he paid $1,000\non December 8, 2006, and has a repayment plan with them. No documentation was provided to\nsupport his position or payment. No other information about the status of the other delinquent debts\nlisted in the SOR or mitigating conditions was provided. \nOn September 4, 2003, Applicant was charged with battery and domestic violence. He was\nfound guilty and paid a fine. \nOn March 29, 2000, Applicant was charged with disturbing the peace. He paid a fine.\nOn December 23, 1993, Applicant was charged with assault and disorderly conduct. The\ncharges were dismissed. \nApplicant was charged on August 26, 1992, with domestic battery and violation of a domestic\nviolence order. The disposition was not recorded. \nOn July 26, 1992 and November 1, 1991, Applicant was charged with domestic battery. He\npaid a fine on each occasion. \nApplicant executed his SCA on August 31, 2005. In response to Question 23, which required\nApplicant to disclose his police record for the past seven years, he deliberately failed to disclose the\ncharges against him on September 4, 2003 and March 29, 2000. \nIn response to Question 28.a, which required Applicant to disclose if in the last seven years\nhe had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts, he deliberately failed to disclose those\nlisted in SOR 1.b through 1.g and 1.h through 1.l. In response to Question 28.b, which required\ndisclosure of debts currently over 90 days delinquent, Applicant failed to disclose the same debts.\nApplicant did not provide any explanation. \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR 1.k and 3.a. The Government failed to provide any\nevidence in support of these allegations.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n3\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\n\nId. at 527.\n4\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n5\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n6\nId.\n7\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n8\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n9\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n10\n4\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n4\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n5\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n6\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n7\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n8\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n9\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.10\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F-Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts that date back to 1996. He\ndid not provide any documentation to substantiate a debt he claimed he paid or another that he\nclaimed he is repaying. He failed to provide any information regarding any of the other debts. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts). In Applicant\u2019s answer he stated he repaid one debt and started\na repayment plan on another. He failed to provide any substantiated documentation on these debts\nor amplifying information on his many other debts. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply.\nBased on all of the evidence, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31a (a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and CC DC 31(b) (allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formerly prosecuted or\nconvicted) apply. Applicant was charged with battery and domestic violence on at least three separate\noccasions and disturbing the peace on one occasion. He paid fines in each case. He had other\ncriminal incidents that were dismissed or not recorded. The battery and domestic violence offenses\noccurred in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 2003, spanning both of his marriages. \nI have considered all of the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions. Applicant failed to\nprovide any information about any of the offenses he admitted committing. There is a serious pattern\nof misconduct by Applicant. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n\n6\nI have considered Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) 16(a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities). Applicant admitted he deliberately failed to disclose\ninformation on his SCA. Therefore, PC DC 16(a) applies. Applicant failed to provide any\nexplanation or other evidence by way of mitigation to the pertinent allegations. Hence, no mitigating\nconditions apply. \nThe Whole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the financial considerations, criminal conduct, and\npersonal conduct concerns. Other than Applicant\u2019s admissions and denials in his answer to the SOR,\nno other information was provided in mitigation. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the\nevidence presented in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline F, Guideline J, and Guideline E are decided\nagainst Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.-1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2\nCriminal Conduct (Guideline J)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.-2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3\nPersonal Conduct (Guideline J)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCarol. G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant has neither invalidated the\npassport nor obtained formal approval for its use. However, although Applicant is not potentially\nsubject to foreign influence because of her family contacts\u2014her parents and brother are dual citizens\nof the U.S. and Iran residing in the U.S., and her grandmother is a citizen of Iran residing in\nFrance\u2014her frequent travel to Iran subjects her to potential foreign influence. Clearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 10 January 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of foreign\ninfluence and foreign preference.  She answered the SOR 31 January 2007, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 29 June 2007 and I convened a hearing 6 August 2007. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) 15 August 2007.\n \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nOn 28 June 2007, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b61.d., alleging\nher travel to Iran. Applicant raised no objection, and I granted the motion (Tr. 11-12). At hearing,\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b61.e., alleging that her new in-laws are\ncitizens and residents of Iran. I denied the motion (Tr. 91-92).\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for SOR 1.c. Accordingly, I\nincorporate those admissions as findings of fact.\nApplicant\u2014a 25-year-old computer analyst employed by a defense contractor since March\n2003\u2014seeks access to classified information. She has not previously held a clearance. However, in\nJuly 2004, she was subject to a background investigation to work for the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA).\nApplicant was born in Iran in August 1981. When she was six years old, she immigrated to\nthe U.S. with her parents. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 1992. Her parents and\nbrother are also naturalized U.S. citizens. Applicant was educated in the U.S., and obtained her\nundergraduate degree in computer science in January 2004.\nAlthough Applicant denies being a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran, she applied for an\nIranian passport in October 2000, which she used to travel to Iran in December 2000, December\n\n3\n2002, and August 2004. While this passport was due to expire in October 2005, Applicant applied\nfor an extension of the expiration date to October 2010. She used her Iranian passport to travel to\nIran in January 2006. Applicant maintains that these trips to Iran were for tourism. She has no\nproperty interests, no personal interests, and no close family members in Iran (Tr. 46).\nIn her October 2006 response to DOHA interrogatories (G.E. 2), Applicant expressed an\nunwillingness to renounce her Iranian citizenship (which she acknowledge having acquired by birth)\nor to surrender her Iranian passport. She is unwilling to renounce her Iranian citizenship because Iran\ndoes not accept renunciation of citizenship and she is concerned that any effort to renounce her\nIranian citizenship \u201ccould result in undesired attention and danger to me and my family by the\nforeign government.\u201d She cited a similar concern over surrendering her Iranian passport, as well as\nthe fact that surrendering the passport \u201cwould inhibit my ability to travel to Iran.\u201d She stated that she\nuses her Iranian passport only to enter Iran, as exiting Iran is facilitated with her U.S. passport. In\nher November 2006 response to DOHA interrogatories (G.E. 3), Applicant restated her\nunwillingness to surrender her Iranian passport because it would curtail her entry into Iran.\nApplicant has not surrendered her Iranian passport. At hearing, she stated a conditional\nwillingness to do so\u2014and to refrain from travel to Iran\u2014during any period she held a clearance,\nprovided she did not have to surrender it to Iranian authorities (Tr. 54). She remained otherwise\nconcerned about the risk to herself and her family ifthe Iranian government were to become aware\n \nof her action.\nAlthough Applicant seems to grasp the concept that she cannot travel to Iran on her U.S.\npassport because of the state of relations between the U.S. and Iran, and Iran\u2019s failure to recognize\nher U.S. citizenship, she apparently fails to grasp the converse concept that she is only able to obtain\nan Iranian passport because Iran considers her an Iranian citizen, and that her application for an\nIranian passport is an assertion of Iranian citizenship on her part. In short, she fails to see why her\npossession and use of an Iranian passport raises security concerns. Applicant asserts that her travel\nto Iran is in the national interest, because it keeps her directly informed of circumstances in Iran and\naids her analytical work for her employer. However, she acknowledges that her trips to Iran are not\nwork related or sanctioned by the U.S. government (Tr. 89).\nIran is a fundamentalist Islamic republic with a poor human rights record. Its relations with\nthe U.S. are confrontational and unlikely to improve given Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons,\nits sponsorship of, support for, and involvement in, international terrorism, and its support for violent\nopposition to the Middle East peace process. Nevertheless, Iran is not a known collector of U.S.\nintelligence or sensitive economic information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nprotected information. \nTravel to Iran remains problematic. The Department of State\u2019s May 2007 Travel Warning\ncontinues to warn U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to Iran, noting that dual\nnational Iranian-American citizens may encounter difficulty in departing Iran. Some elements of the\nIranian government and population remain hostile to the U.S. Consequently, American citizens may\nbe subject to harassment or arrest while traveling or residing in Iran. Americans of Iranian origin are\nurged to consider the risk of being targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. In addition,\nIranian authorities may deny dual nationals access to the U.S. Interests Section in Tehran, because\nthey are considered to be solely Iranian citizens. Large-scale demonstrations have taken place in\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n4\nvarious regions throughout Iran over the past several years as a result of a sometimes volatile\npolitical climate. U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite the travel warning are urged to exercise\ncaution.\nThe U.S. government does not currently have diplomatic or consular relations with the\nIslamic Republic of Iran, and, therefore, cannot provide protection or routine consular services to\nAmerican citizens in Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as\nprotecting power for U.S. interests in Iran. Neither U.S. passports nor visas to the United States are\nissued in Tehran. The Iranian government does not recognize dual citizenship and generally does not\npermit the Swiss to provide protective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals. In\naddition, U.S. citizens of Iranian origin who are considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens have been\ndetained and harassed by Iranian authorities.\nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor considers her work to be excellent, trusts her, and recommends\nher for her clearance (Tr. 35-41). However, he is only aware of the dual-citizenship issues in the\ncase, not the passport and travel issues (Tr. 44).\n \nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines list factors to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference) .\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make\n5\nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country.\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may\nraise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n3\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected information,\nand to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts\nwith foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if\nthose contacts create a heightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.4\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline B\nas regards her family members who are dual Iranian-U.S. citizens or solely Iranian citizens, residing\noutside Iran. Considering first the foreign country involved, Iran and the U.S. enjoy strained foreign\nrelations at best. Although Iran is not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive economic\ninformation, or known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information, the fact that Iran does\nnot recognize dual citizenship and considers such citizens to be solely Iranian might present security\nconcerns regarding Applicant\u2019s parents, brother, and grandmother if they resided in Iran. However,\ngiven that her parents and brother reside in the U.S. as U.S. citizens, and her grandmother resides\nin France, the government\u2019s evidence failed to establish that there was any risk, much less a\nheightened risk, of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because\nof Applicant\u2019s family contacts outside Iran.\nNevertheless, the government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B\nbecause of her travel to Iran in December 2000, December 2002, August 2004, and January 2006.5\nOrdinarily, travel to a foreign country\u2014even a country of origin\u2014has no independent security\nsignificance, but only serves to demonstrate an Applicant\u2019s ties of affection to family members\nresiding there. However, in this case Applicant travels to Iran for vacation, and subjects herself to\nthe jurisdiction of a government that is hostile to the U.S., but considers her to be only an Iranian\ncitizen and thus likely to be denied access to what little assistance is available to U.S. citizens\nthrough the U.S. Interests Section in Tehran. Even though Iran is not an active collector of sensitive\nU.S. information, an applicant in Applicant\u2019s circumstances who travels to Iran presents a potential\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n6\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n7\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11.(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n8\n\u00b6 11.\u00a9) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n9\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 11.(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n10\n\u00b6 11.(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n11\ninvalidated; \n6\ntarget of opportunity that presents an unacceptable risk of being coerced to provide information. I\nresolve Guideline B against Applicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by showing\nthat Applicant obtained an Iranian passport in October 2000, had it extended in October 2005, used\nit to travel to Iran in December 2000, December 2002, August 2004, and January 2006,  and is likely\nto use it to travel to Iran in the future, despite becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 1992.6\nApplicant has not mitigated the Guideline C security concerns. Although she has been a dual citizen\nof Iran and the United States since her birth, her Iranian citizenship would have little security\nsignificance if based solely on her parents\u2019 citizenship. For her conduct to fall within the security\nconcerns of Guideline C, she must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation\nover the United States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the United\nStates is not required before the government can seek to deny access under Guideline C. The\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring those entrusted with this nation's secrets will make\ndecisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also be a citizen.\n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference. Her dual\ncitizenship is not based solely on her parents\u2019 citizenship, but is based on her active exercise of dual\ncitizenship after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  She has not expressed a willingness to\n7\nrenounce her foreign citizenship, albeit so she would not draw the attention of Iranian authorities to\nherself.   All exercise of dual citizenship occurred after she obtained U.S. citizenship, while she was\n8\nan adult.  Applicant's use of her Iranian passport has not been sanctioned by the U.S.  Although she\n9\n10\nstated a conditional willingness, based on obtaining her clearance, to invalidate her passport and\nrefrain from traveling to Iran while she has a clearance, she has taken no action to invalidate her\npassport.  Further, foregoing travel to Iran while she has a clearance does not mitigate the security\n11\nconcerns. Once she stopped having access to classified information, she would still have the\nknowledge acquired while cleared. Renewing and using her Iranian passport in the future, as seems\nlikely, would subject that information to potential compromise. While Applicant has a legal right to\nmaintain her dual citizenship with its attendant benefits and responsibilities, she has not\ndemonstrated that she can be counted on to always act in preference to the United States. I resolve\nGuideline C against Applicant.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

On November 17, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided upon the written record.  On August\n31, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\n(1) Applicant\u2019s counsel on appeal argues that Applicant was not an attorney and that he did\nnot know how to collect and present the type of evidence necessary to support his case.  He therefore\nasks that the case be remanded so that Applicant can offer additional evidence with the benefit of\nrepresentation by counsel.  The Board construes Applicant\u2019s request as raising the issue of whether\nApplicant was denied due process.\nA review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth\nin Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Applicant requested that his case be decided on the\nwritten record.  He was  provided with a copy of the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM),\nand given an opportunity to object to those exhibits and provide his own evidence to rebut the\ngovernment\u2019s allegations.  Applicant filed a response to the government\u2019s FORM, which included\na detailed explanation and multiple documentary exhibits.  \nAlthough pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take\ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that\nfailure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6\n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).  DOHA proceedings are civil in nature and applicants are not entitled to\nthe procedural protections afforded to criminal defendants.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at\n5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2004).  Therefore, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are of no\nmoment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2006).  Given the record in this\ncase, Applicant has no valid claim for denial of due process under the Directive or Executive Order,\nand is not entitled to a second opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.    \n(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge should have concluded, as a matter of law, that\nthe security concerns raised by his history of financial difficulties had been mitigated because his\n\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 1998 and was granted a discharge in November 1998.  At that\n2\ntime he had $80,196 in assets and $114,640 in liabilities.  In January 2002 he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but the\nfiling was dismissed in December 2002 because he defaulted on the payment plan.  At that time he had $285,386 in assets\nand $255,496 in liabilities.  In September 2002 he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but the filing was dismissed in May\n2003.  At that time he had $266,811 in assets and $248,857 in liabilities.  In September 2004 he filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and was granted a discharge in March 2005.  At that time he had $13,080 in assets and $267,481 in liabilities.\n3\nmost recent discharge in bankruptcy  occurred almost three years ago in 2005 and his current\n2\nfinancial problems are \u201cminor.\u201d  He also argues that the Judge gave insufficient weight to the fact\nthat he had completed financial counseling.  As part of his appeal, Applicant cites to several DOHA\nHearing Office decisions in which an applicant in ostensibly similar circumstances was granted a\nclearance.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Board gives due consideration to the Hearing Office cases which Applicant has cited in\nhis appeal brief.  However, such decisions are not binding on Hearing Office Judges or on the Board.\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-14853 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2007).  They do not demonstrate error in this\ncase. See ISCR Case No. 06-18340 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007). \nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security eligibility, there\nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v.\nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the\nth\ngovernment presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nestablish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See ISCR Case No. 01-14740\nat 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 05-02833\n(App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See\nISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of financial difficulties\nwhich had resulted in multiple bankruptcies.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\n\n4\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  He found in favor of Applicant as to SOR\nparagraph 1.e and the Guideline J allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041\nat 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

In January 2002, Applicant filed a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13. When\nApplicant made no payments under the payment plan, the petition was dismissed in December 2002.\nHe filed a second Chapter 13 petition in September 2002. The second petition was dismissed when\nApplicant made no payments. While he claimed he wanted to repay the creditors, Applicant filed the\ntwo petitions to protect the equity interest in his house. In September 2004 (less than six years after\nreceiving his first Chapter 7 discharge, and less than two years after his second Chapter 13 petition\nwas dismissed) Applicant filed his second Chapter 7 petition. In March 2005, he eliminated\n$267,481.00 in liability through discharge. Considering (1) the passage of less than three years since\nhis discharge, (2) the evidence of continuing though minor financial problems, and (3) the absence\nof financial counseling and character evidence, I am unable to find in his favor under the financial\nguideline. Regarding the worthless check crimes Applicant pled guilty to, and other worthless checks\nthat he was not prosecuted for, the passage of time, as well as Applicant\u2019s remorse and restitution\npersuades me to find in his favor under the criminal conduct guideline. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On November 17, 2006, under Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5200.6, with revised Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for its security concerns\nraised under the financial considerations guideline (Guideline F) and the criminal conduct guideline\n(Guideline J) of the Directive. In his notarized answer dated December 29, 2006, Applicant\nsubmitted admissions to each of the nine allegations under Guideline F. Though he did not provide\nan answer to the allegation under Guideline J, the findings of guilt under subparagraphs 1.f. and 1.g.,\nand his guilty plea under subparagraph 1.h. manifests criminal conduct. He requested a decision be\nmade on the record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on April 23, 2007. He received the FORM on May 2,\n2007. Applicant\u2019s undated response to the FORM was received by DOHA on July 20, 2007 via\nUnited States Post Office, Express Mail. The response, objected to by Department Counsel, contains\ndocuments dated in May 2007, as well as documents dated after the June 1, 2007 date when\nApplicant\u2019s response was due.  Department Counsel\u2019s objection is overruled, and the entire response\n1\nis admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to me for decision on July 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n His SCA indicates he was married to her between March1994 and January 2000. \n2\n According to his Security Clearance Application (SCA), Applicant was unemployed from July 2001 to June\n3\n2002, and from June 2003 to November 2003. See. Item 5.\n3\nApplicant is 47 years old and has been employed as a fireman by a defense contractor since\nJune 2004. He married his present wife in September 2002, and has five children and stepchildren.\nHe seeks a security clearance. \nIn May 1998, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition (SOR, 1.a.). In November\n1998, Applicant was granted a Chapter 7 discharge with assets totaling $80,196.00 and liabilities\nadding up to $114,640.00. Applicant\u2019s SCA reflects this petition was filed while he was married to\nhis second wife.  The Schedule F (unsecured creditors with nonpriority claims) section of the petition\n2\nreflects that his second wife was liable for most of the unsecured debt. Of the 15 unsecured personal\nclaims against his wife, 13 were for medical services and two were for legal services. However, after\nadding the Schedule F debts with those appearing in Schedule D (Item 11), most of the debt\nidentified in the 1998 bankruptcy arose during the course of the second marriage. \nIn September 1999, Applicant began a debt consolidation plan involving 10 creditors. He\nmade regular payments under the plan over the next 13 months. He made his first payment of\n$130.00, one payment of $140.00, four payments of $150.00, six payments of $162.00, and one\npayment of $552.22 on December 20, 2000 under the plan. Applicant received a letter dated May\n20, 2007 from the debt plan organization indicating, \u201cCongratulations! You have successfully\ncompleted the Debt Management Program of [organization]. The status of your account has been\nchanged to \u201cPaid in Full.\u201d Applicant provided no other information about the plan except his claim\nthat his successful completion of the plan after his divorce to his second wife constituted credit\ncounseling. Even though his final payment under the plan was in December 2000, he provided no\nexplanation why notification of successful completion of the plan did not arrive until May 2007.\nIn January 2002, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition (SOR 1.b.) with assets\ntotaling $285,386.00 and liabilities of $255,496.02. The Chapter 13 petition was dismissed (SOR\n1.c.) As Applicant defaulted on the payment plan obligating him to pay $900.00 a month. Applicant\nstrenuously maintains his third wife (April 2000 to November 2001) was the primary reason the\npetition was filed. While they were married, he discovered she had a criminal record and a mental\nproblem. When he confronted her with her history, she launched a campaign to destroy him.\nAccording to Applicant, she hit him, vandalized his auto, and stole his computer. She violated a\ncourt-order not to sell their house. Applicant is certain he suffered emotional distress and\nembarrassment from her constant harassment. He lost his job as a paramedic/fireman and had trouble\nfinding other employment.  He filed the Chapter 13 to protect the property he had left, and to control\n3\nhis financial situation. However, the fees associated with the divorce and lack of income forced him\nto have the Chapter 13 petition dismissed in December 2002. \nThere were 25 creditors listed in Schedule F of Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 petition (SOR 1.b.,\n1.c., Item 12) filed in January 2002, and the total amount of Schedule F debt was $25,976.25.\nApplicant provided non-sufficient fund checks to 11 of the 25 listed creditors. Though Applicant\nclaims that \u201cMany of the checks were paid, even though they were listed,\u201d no documentation was\n\n The second page of Applicant\u2019s three-page explanatory response to FORM..\n4\n Eleven of the checks were the same as those listed in the previous Chapter 13 filing. \n5\n The second page of Applicant\u2019s three-page explanation to his response to the FORM. \n6\n4\nprovided to support this claim.\u201d  In addition, there is no record in the documentation (Item 12) that\n4\nApplicant made any payments under the Chapter 13 plan. \nIn September 2002, Applicant filed a second Chapter 13 petition (SOR, 1.d., Item 13) with\nassets totaling $266,811.00 and liabilities of $248,857.38. The petition was dismissed in May 2003.\nApplicant was hoping to receive a settlement from the divorce proceedings (involving his third wife)\nbased on his equity in the house. Because the judge concluded Applicant filed the bankruptcy\nproceedings to delay the divorce proceedings, the judge, according to Applicant, did not award him\nany money from the house. Applicant also noted the divorce decree order required him to provide\nspousal maintenance. He mentioned the house and the maintenance as reasons the second Chapter\n13 was dismissed. He reiterated his displeasure with the divorce court\u2019s ruling against him regarding\nthe equity interest in the house. \nThe second Chapter 13 petition (SOR, 1.d.) lists 33 Schedule F creditors totaling $96,709.68.\nTwelve of the debts were non-sufficient fund checks  written by Applicant. On March 25, 2003, the\n5\ntrustee entered a final report and accounting indicating that Applicant paid $595.00 under the\nChapter 13 petition. The petition was dismissed in May 2003.Applicant does not understand why\nhis filing of the Chapter 13 petition is not considered a bona fide effort to repay his creditors. \nIn September 2004, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition (SOR, 1.e.). At the time\nof filing, his assets were $13,080.00 and liabilities $267,481.00. Applicant was granted a Chapter\n7 discharge in March 2005. He noted in his answer to the SOR and/or his response to the FORM,\nthat impending suits by creditors and potential wage garnishments were the reason for filing his\nChapter 7 petition. There were additional debts included in the Chapter 7 petition as \u201cit is mandatory\nthat all creditors be listed.\u201d  There are 81 creditors identified in the Schedule F portion of this\n6\npetition. \nApplicant admitted he was found guilty of insufficient funds - check (SOR, 1.f.) on February\n18, 2004. He and his wife were working at a hospital in different capacities. He claims she\ndiscovered the hospital was committing violations and she threatened to notify the authorities. The\nhospital fired her, and subsequently fired Applicant. Applicant forgot about the outstanding checks\nhe had written before he closed his checking account at the local bank. No additional information\nwas provided.\nOn February 18, 2004, Applicant was found guilty of three additional counts of insufficient\nfunds - check (SOR, 1.g.), a misdemeanor. He paid a fine and completed 30 additional hours of\ncommunity service. According to Applicant, no additional, non-sufficient funds checks have been\nwritten since 2004. \nOn October 15, 2002, Applicant pled guilty to three counts of worthless check (SOR, 1.I) and\nordered to pay restitution, sentenced to 30 days (suspended), and placed on unsupervised probation\n\n5\nfor 12 months. \nThough Applicant was unsure about the status of the public utility debt (SOR, 1.i.) in his\nanswer to the SOR, he and his wife discovered the debt was his. Documentation reflects Applicant\npaid at least $294.00 on the debt under a payment plan. \nIn his three-page response to the FORM, Applicant stated he continued to repay some\ncreditors that were listed in the Chapter 7 petition, and listed at a subsequent location of his response\nunder the heading \u201c2004 Chapter 7, PAID DEBTS and Duplicates.\u201d The first entry is a $3,000.00\nPromissory Note applying to a personal auto loan. While the Promissory Note that was signed on\nOctober 2003 indicates the note was to be paid on October 1, 2004, there is no record of payments.\nThe second entry refers to a $24.00 bill to a video store, followed by a date of \u201c2002.\u201d There is\ndocumentation (at a subsequent location in his response to the FORM) dated August 2006 from a\ncollection agency that Applicant owed $10.72 on the bill. A handwritten notation of paid and a date\nof January 18, 2007 was placed under the typed August date of the bill. The third creditor is a\ncollection agency holding a $500.00 account, followed by the date \u201c7/13/00.\u201d No documentation in\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM was found explaining the status of the collection account. \nThe fourth entry of Applicant\u2019s list of paid debts is a $1,042.00 account from a state credit\nbureau. The supporting documentation is dated January 18, 2000. Applicant provided no explanation\nwhy the account, that was supposedly paid in January 2000, would appear four years later in his\nChapter 7 petition. The fifth and seventh entries were discharged in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in 1998. The sixth and ninth entries were resolved in 2000 through Applicant\u2019s debt\nconsolidation plan. The tenth entry ($155.00) makes a reference to \u201cSure Check.\u201d No additional\ninformation was provided.\nThe documentation furnished under the next two entries reflects that both debts totaling about\n$1,600.00 were dismissed on March 9, 2006. However, the documentation does not reveal why both\ncivil actions were dismissed, and I cannot assume Applicant paid both accounts. \nThe thirteenth and fourteenth entry of the section listing paid debts and duplicates, identify\ntwo debts Applicant claimed did not belong to him. Applicant noted that he never incurred the debts,\nbut did not provide information in support of his position. The final entry listed is for $48.00 held\nby a management company. The typed date \u201c1/27/04\" appears to the right of the management\ncompany. The documents placed behind the list of paid debts provide no additional information\nabout this account. \nThe next section \u201cDEBTS BEING PAID\u201dlists additional debts Applicant is supposedly\npaying. The first entry is the medical credit union account with a current balance of $6,888.00. The\ncredit union is not listed in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and there is no documentation of the\nactual status of the account. There is no documentation either regarding how the college account,\nlisted in the Chapter 7 petition (Item 14), was reduced to $1,000.00. There is an amount ($2943.84)\nappearing to the right of state bank entry, but there is no supporting documentation that tracks how\nthe account was paid. \nThe fourth entry in the debts being paid section is a medical debt (listed in the Chapter 7\npetition) of Applicant\u2019s wife. The original amount was $2,562.00, and documentation reflects the\n\n6\naccount has been paid down to $1,805.76. There is no documentation indicating the education debt\nis down to $3,000.00. There is an educational loan document referring to Applicant\u2019s wife that\nindicated a balance owing the department of education, and a handwritten notation the account was\npaid on August 28, 2005. No other documentation was provided. Finally, there is no documentation\nsupporting Applicant\u2019s claim the sixth creditor (Applicant\u2019s third wife, and the purported cause of\nhis unsuccessful, Chapter 13 petitions) is being paid.\nIn a subsequent section of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM entitled \u201cADDITIONAL\nPAID ACCOUNTS NOT SHOWING,\u201d Applicant listed six creditors that were not listed in his\nbankruptcy or credit bureau report due to the fact he satisfied them.  Applicant stated he made a\npayment of $294.24 to the collection agency for the public utility\u2019s agency to bring the delinquent\naccount down to $876.73. The documentation does not show the payment amount, but it does reflect\na balance of $876.73. The documentation also indicates the next payment of $150.00 was due on\nJuly 21, 2007. The collection agency for an anesthesia business firm acknowledged the firm was paid\nin full in July 2000. The third debt was satisfied in July 2003. The fourth debt dated August 17, 2006\n(addressed earlier) belongs to a collection service who advised Applicant of a debt of 10.72. A\nhandwritten note underneath the typed date indicates Applicant paid the debt in January 2007. \nAs noted earlier in the discussion about paid debts, the fifth debt (education loan belonging\nto Applicant\u2019s wife) has a handwritten note indicating the debt was paid in August 2005. The credit\nbureau report belonging to Applicant\u2019s wife is not helpful in ascertaining the status of education loan\nas there are several education loans listed; their status varies from \u201cINCLUDED IN\nBANKRUPTCY\u201d to \u201cTRSF/SOLD.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau report prepared by the three major credit agencies on July 18, 2007\nshows that between 16 and 23 accounts were reported. Up to three accounts were determined to be\ndelinquent. Up to seven accounts contained derogatory information. At least nine of the accounts\nwere determined to be current. Applicant also disputed at least eight of the accounts with the\nrequisite credit agencies on June 27, 2007, and was notified the estimated completion date for the\ninvestigation results would be July 28, 2007.  \nAs noted earlier in this section, Applicant supplied documentation of his successful\ncompletion of a debt consolidation plan that lasted from September 1999 to December 20, 2000.\nApplicant provided no evidence of financial counseling. There is no independent character evidence\ndescribing Appellant\u2019s job performance.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\n\n7\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nFinancial Considerations\nFailure to live within one\u2019s means by satisfying debts in a timely fashion raises security\nconcerns under this guideline.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe guideline addresses criminal activity that casts doubt on a person\u2019s judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness. A person who cannot comply with the law may not be a suitable candidate to\nsafeguard classified information.`\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations (FC) Paying debts on a timely basis furnishes persuasive evidence of\nfinancial responsibility and good judgment. Conversely, the failure to pay debts, indicated by\ncollection accounts, judgments, repossessions and garnishments, generates security concerns by\nplacing the individual at risk of committing acts of poor judgment to generate funds. Obtaining relief\nunder the bankruptcy laws is a legal method of resolving financial difficulties. Therefore, a Chapter\n7 bankruptcy discharge in an applicant\u2019s financial history does not automatically have a disqualifying\nimpact on an applicant\u2019s security suitability. However, resorting to the bankruptcy laws on four\noccasions between November 1998 and September 2004 raises significant questions about\nApplicant\u2019s capability of managing his financial responsibilities. \nHaving weighed and balanced the circumstances of this case under the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) of the FC guideline, FC DC 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and\nc. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) the government has established its case.\nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s judicial pleas and/or findings of guilt for writing worthless checks fall\nwithin the scope of 19.d. (deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee\ntheft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense fraud, filing deceptive loan statements and other\nintentional financial breaches of trust) \nThe government\u2019s case is also established by FC DC 19.e. (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\n\n8\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) based on the filing of four petitions between May\n1998 and September 2004, and the sizeable amount liability accumulated and discharged during the\nperiod. \nThere are five potentially mitigating conditions (MC) that may overcome the disqualifying\nevidence under the financial guideline. FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) would be seriously\nconsidered had there been no continuing evidence of financial trouble after November 1998 when\nApplicant received his first Chapter 7 discharge. However, FC MC 20.a. must be removed from\nconsideration due to the second Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition that was discharged less than three\nyears ago. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted reasonably under the circumstances)\napplies to those situations where an unforeseen, unanticipated event(s) arise to preclude a person\nfrom handling their financial obligations in a responsible manner. Applicant has provided a large\namount of documentation, e.g., police reports, affidavits, written exchanges between attorneys,\ndescribing his relationship with his third wife during and after his marriage. While I conclude the\ndocumentation shows there was animus between Applicant and his third wife, I cannot assign much\nweight to the documentation because it is hearsay and has not been officially adjudicated. In\naddition, I also conclude Applicant lacked bona fide intentions of complying with the terms of the\nfirst Chapter 13 petition as he was unemployed in January 2002 when the petition was filed. It\nappears the only reason he filed was to protect his equity interest in his house. Even before the first\nChapter 13 was dismissed, he filed a second Chapter 13 petition in September 2002, claiming again\nhe wanted to repay his creditors. The fact that no payments were made under the first or second\npetitions (dismissed in May 2003) belies: (1) Applicant\u2019s claim that he was seriously intending to\nrepay his creditors, and (2) his claim he acted reasonably in filing both petitions. The limited\nextenuation that Applicant\u2019s unemployment and divorce afford him under FC MC 20.b. is\ninsufficient to overcome the adverse evidence under FC DC 19.a., c., d. and e.\nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies in those circumstances where there has been a good faith effort to\nrepay creditors.  Though Applicant provided documented evidence of completion of a debt\nconsolidation plan in December 2000, I am unable to determine why he did not receive\nacknowledgment of the plan\u2019s completion until six years later in May 2007, and in an ambiguously\nworded letter. Furthermore, his successful completion of the plan in December 2000 is outweighed\nby the countervailing evidence of his failure to complete either Chapter 13 plan in 2002 and 2003.\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant listed 21 creditors in an attempt to establish that he\nhad continued to repay creditors even though they were listed in his 2004 Chapter 7 petition.\nApparently, there were creditors that were not discharged from the 2004 Chapter 7. The supporting\ndocumentation for each creditor was evaluated in my factual findings. Aside from four debts that\nhave appropriate documentation corroborating payment, most of the listed debts have little or no\ndocumentation showing that repayments were made. Two of the listed debts were resolved in the\ndebt consolidation plan in December 2000. Two of the listed debts were discharged in Applicant\u2019s\n\n9\nbankruptcy in 1998. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find that FC MC 20.d. has only limited\napplication concerning Applicant\u2019s efforts to repay overdue creditors.\nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 discharge in March 2005 represents another way to resolve debts\nwithin the meaning of \u201cotherwise resolve debts\u201d portion of FC MC 20.d. As discussed at the outset\nof this section, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge provides the individual a legitimate way to\neliminate debt, and is not necessarily disqualifying when followed by convincing evidence\ndemonstrating a sustained track record of financial responsibility. But, this record reflects\nApplicant\u2019s continuing financial problems, culminating in the discharge of his second Chapter 7\nbankruptcy discharge in March 2005. Because resolution of debts through bankruptcy does not\nfurnish the same level of mitigation as an extended record of good-faith effort to repay creditors,\nApplicant\u2019s second Chapter 7 discharge in less that seven years receives even less\nmitigation/extenuation under FC MC 20.d. Even when the evidence under FC MC 20.d. is combined\nwith the unemployment and divorce problems triggering the application of FC MC 20.b., Applicant\nhas provided no evidence under FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling\nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under\ncontrol) Considering the entire record under the financial allegations, particularly the lack of\nfinancial counseling and independent character evidence, I find against Applicant under\nsubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. I find for him under subparagraph 1.e. but against him under\nsubparagraph 1.i. for failing to include the debt in his Chapter 7, then neglecting to resolve the debt\nimmediately after he received the SOR in November 2006. Applicant has not met his ultimate\nburden of persuasion under the FC guideline.\nCriminal Conduct (CC). Criminal behavior establishes doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. If a person is willing to violate the criminal laws, then there is an\nunacceptable risk he may capriciously refuse to comply with security rules and regulations he\nchooses not to follow. The circumstances in this case invoke CC DC 31.a. (a single serious crime\nor multiple lesser offenses) as Applicant wrote at least eleven worthless checks in 2001 and 2002.\nHe pled guilty to writing three worthless checks in 2002 and 2004.

Though Applicant\u2019s\nChapter 7 discharge has been found in his favor, the elimination of $267,481.00 in liability occurred\nin March 2005, less than two and a half years ago. Applicant has produced little or no evidence\nidentifying the systemic changes he has made in his financial practices to prevent a recurrence of\nfinancial problems. Without financial counseling, a good-faith effort to repay creditors, and a\nsignificant period of time that demonstrates financial responsibility, I cannot state with complete\nconfidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will not return in the future. \n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a.\nAgainst  the Applicant.\nSubparagraph b.\nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubpargraph c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph f.\nAgainst  the Applicant.\nSubparagraph g. \nAgainst  the Applicant.\nSubparagraph h.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph i.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J): \nFOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph a.\nFor the Applicant. \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

One debt was disputed, and another debt was not established.\nEleven debts were paid.  The nine remaining delinquent debts totaled $10,861.  Her financial\nsituation was aggravated by her payments to her children who were attending college.  She is making\nslow but continuous progress in the payment of her remaining debts.

Security\nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations, personal conduct and criminal conduct are mitigated\nunder the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nThe Statement of Reasons (SOR), does not cite or refer to Department of Defense (DoD)\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended,\nbut it does cite DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the\nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions\nof the Directive to resolve contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  In this case,\nthe pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive are the\nsame.  The Regulation, paragraph C8.2.1 provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply\nfor contractor personnel. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nOn August 17, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a\nQuestionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Standard Form (SF) 85P.   On August 31, 2006, the\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to her, pursuant to the Directive.2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), E (Personal\nConduct) and J (Criminal Conduct) and details reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant\u2019s\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that she is not eligible for occupying\nan ADP I/II/III position.  Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions for Guidelines E, F and J are in\nthe Regulation at pages 142-144 and 150. \nIn a notarized answer, received at DOHA on September 18, 2006, Applicant responded to\nthe SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.   On October 31, 2006, the\n3\ncase was assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 29, 2006.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on December 14, 2006, and I received it on December 15, 2006.  I held the\n\nEx. E (Documentation from Applicant supplementing record with cover letter from Department Counsel).\n4\nThe source for all factual assertions in this paragraph is Ex. 6, supra n. 3.\n5\nEx. 1, supra n. 1, at 1 (date of birth) \n6\nId., at 3 (stating she has been employed with the same government contractor since 2002).   \n7\nEx. 1, supra n. 1, question 16, at 6 (military service).\n8\nId., question 10, at 2 (where you went to school).  \n9\nId., question 14, at 5 (marriage).\n10\nShe did not list any children in her SF 85P.  See Ex. 1, supra n. 1, question 15, at 5 (your relatives).  \n11\n3\nrecord open (R. 51, 53), to permit Applicant to submit additional matters, and on January 3, 2007,\nshe provided additional documentation concerning her financial matters.     \n4\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAs to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible\nfor twenty of the twenty-two debts alleged in the SOR, and under Guideline E, she admitted the the\nfalsification allegation without elaboration.   She did not respond to the Guideline J allegation. Her\n5\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is 53 years old (R. 6).   Since June 1997, she has been employed by a United States\n6\ngovernment contractor and is involved with processing sensitive medical records (R. 8, 49).   She\n7\nhas no prior military service.   She attended a technical college from 1972 to 1975 and received an\n8\nAssociates degree in business (R. 6).   She was never married.   She has three children (R. 25), and\n9\n10\nover the years received some financial support, but did not receive court ordered child support (R.\n32).  Her youngest child is now 23, and none of her children are not part of her household (R. 31).11\nShe provided financial support for her 30 year old daughter from 1998 to 2002 and to another child\nwhile they were attending college and unemployed (R. 27, 31). \nIn November and December 2006, Applicant paid or resolved twelve debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n1.c, 1.e, 1.j - 1.l, 1.n, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.t - 1.v, which totaled $1,025.  \nThe nine SOR debts that are scheduled for resolution through a payment play are in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.f - 1.i, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.s.  The debts included in her payment plan total $10,861.  The debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.d of $305 is disputed because she believed she had paid the creditor (R. 33-34).  \nApplicant currently has two part time jobs to provide additional income (R. 25).  One job\npays $220 and the other pays $110 per month (R. 28).  She had difficulty managing a checking\naccount (R. 26).  She closed her checking account two years ago because she wrote at least two bad\nchecks that bounced, and she could not maintain an accurate record of her balance (R. 27, 29).\nSometimes she forgot about writing checks, or thought they had cleared her account already (R. 28).\nIn the past she attempted to pay her creditors.  However, her vehicles that she used for transportation\n\nThe SOR \u00b6 1.a amount is $5,852.  Applicant provided a letter from this creditor indicating the amount of this\n12\ndebt had increased to $6,634 (Ex. B).\n4\nto work would break down, her children would need something, or some other problem would occur,\nand she was prevented her from paying her debts (R. 30, 35-36).  She inherited the home where she\nlives and has no rent or mortgage payments (R. 30; Ex. C at 2). \nThe following table lists the amount of each debt and its current status.\nSOR \u00b6   \nAmount of debt in $\nStatus of debt\n   1.a\n6,63412\nPayment Plan and statute of limitations (Ex.

The remainder of this paragraph is derived from Applicant\u2019s\n13\nPSF.  \n5\nA witness with excellent financial and business credentials (W) made a statement on\nApplicant\u2019s behalf (R. 38-48).  W assisted Applicant as a volunteer without receiving remuneration\nfor her services.  W met with Applicant every two weeks for two months and provided financial\ncounseling, which included budgeting, eliminating unnecessary expenses (such as cable television),\ndebt tracking, saving, maintaining contact with creditors, meeting goals and obligations, and\nassembling an emergency fund (R. 40-41, 46-48).  W arranged for a charitable organization to loan\nApplicant several hundred dollars so that she could pay her smaller debts to help establish her\ntrustworthiness, and maintain her employment (R. 41, 44). Applicant\u2019s debt to the charitable\norganization will be paid out of her next tax refund (R. 42).  Applicant only has one credit card and\nis supposed to pay her debts using money orders (R. 44).  W maintains contact with her clients to\nensure they stay on their budget and pay their debts according to their payment plans (R. 42).\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s payment plan, her debts will be paid in 26 months (R. 43; Ex. C-D). W\npromised to continue to work with Applicant and expressed confidence that Applicant understood\nher financial responsibilities and would comply with her budget and payment program (R. 48; Ex.\nC-D). \nIn 2006, Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) to W.   Her net salary,\n13\nincluding both of her part time jobs was $1,270 per month.  She budgeted as follows:  debt reduction\n($410), allowance ($52), savings ($25), rent ($0), groceries ($75), utilities (power, sewer, water and\ntelephone) ($150), insurance (payroll deduction), vehicle expenses ($548) and recreation ($10).  The\n2006 PFS meets the goal of her debt reduction plan by providing $410 per month. The PSF did not\nlist any assets.\nPersonal and Criminal Conduct\nQuestion 22b asks, \u201cYOUR FINANCIAL RECORD Are you now over 180 days delinquent\non any loan or financial obligation?  Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal\nGovernment.\u201d  Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a allege that this answer is false. \nThe following colloquy provides Applicant\u2019s rationale for failing to answer, \u201cYes,\u201d in\nresponse to Question 22b:\nAdministrative Judge (AJ):  Why didn\u2019t you put the debts on the form?\n \nA.  Sir, I didn\u2019t \u2013 well, my understanding \u2013 I really didn\u2019t thought (sic) that it was\n(sic) necessary (sic) had to be done.  \nAJ.  Why?\nA.  I didn\u2019t know that my job would have any effect to (sic) my credit.\nAJ.  You mean, you understood the question?\nA.  Yes, sir.\n\n6\nAJ.  That they were asking for your debts, and you just put, \u201cNo\u201d?\nA.  Because I didn\u2019t know that \u2013 really, I didn\u2019t thought (sic) it was any meaningful\n(sic) for them knowing it.\nAJ.  Were you embarrassed about it, or \u2013 I mean, why not just put it \u2013 put the\ninformation down, or at least say \u2013 write, yes, I have lots of debts, you know, if you\ndidn\u2019t want to, you know, track it down and get the specifics and all that?\nA.  Probably \u2013 I think \u2013 I was embarrassed.\n( R. 50-51).  \nApplicant further explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that my job might depend on the information that\n\u2013 that you asked (sic) on the (sic) \u2013 what we had to  \u2013 clearance came (sic), the people came there.\nI didn\u2019t know it was important.  They didn\u2019t express (sic) to us like that.  They just said this \u2013 well,\nI guess I shouldn\u2019t say it but I will say this \u2013 [s]he said just fill out \u2013 just fill it out, she said.  Just put\nsomething on there.  That was told (sic) to me.\u201d  ( R. 54).  Applicant agreed with Department\nCounsel that her motivation was to avoid embarrassment (R. 55).  She commented that she did not\nrealize that she had so many delinquent debts until she saw her credit report (R. 55).  She said she\nlearned from her mistakes (R. 60), and she promised in the future to ensure she provided completely\naccurate information on trustworthiness forms, even if she had to provide embarrassing information\n(R. 54).  \nI carefully observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor as she addressed the falsification of her SF 85P.\nI am convinced she answered, \u201cNo\u201d because she did not believe it was important to the government\nto have information about her delinquent debts, and to avoid embarrassment.  At her hearing she\nresponded in a forthright, candid manner to the best of her ability.  Her intention was not to deceive\nthe government into erroneously making a positive trustworthiness determination.  Moreover, her\nlack of understanding of the importance of accuracy affected her answers.  She lacks sophistication\nabout financial matters, as shown by her inability to balance her check book.  She was very careless\nin the preparation of her SF 85P, as demonstrated by her failure to list her children on her SF 85P.\nAfter considering all the record evidence, I find that she was truthful at her hearing about her\nrationale for answering, \u201cNo\u201d to Question 22b.\nPOLICIES\nIn the evaluation of an Applicant\u2019s security suitability for a public trust position, an\nadministrative judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the\nRegulation.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\n14\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n7\nTo be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Regulation.  \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties\nis that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are\nsuch that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.\u201d  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Regulation, Appendix\n8.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in\nthe Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which could mitigate trustworthiness concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are\nset forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.\nSince the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final\ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position\nis \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn\nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.  The\n14\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  If the government meets its initial burden, the Applicant then has\nthe burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or\nmitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s case.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.\nDec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  These same\nburdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n15\n8\nA person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The scope\nof an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are\nnot at issue in these proceedings.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay her\ndebts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government\ninformation. Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government\u2019s concern regarding\nfinancial considerations, stating, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts\nor is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect\nsensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and FC DC 3, \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d  FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to\nher failures to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable or unwilling to\npay her debts.  Her SOR debts remained delinquent for several years.  Nine SOR debts are being\nresolved through a payment plan.  The government produced substantial evidence of these two\ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a\nmitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.15\nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, \u201cthe behavior was\nnot recent;\u201d FC MC 2, \u201cit was an isolated incident;\u201d FC MC 3, \u201cconditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;\u201d FC MC 4, \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control\u201d and FC MC 6, \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd.\n16\nMay 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole. \nThe Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or\n17\notherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts.  The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019  However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). In ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999), the Appeal Board\nspecifically addressed application of the statute of limitations, stating a \u201cperson who decides not to honor his or her debts\nmay be able to avoid paying those debts until they are legally uncollectible because the statute of limitations has run.\nReliance on the running of a statute of limitations would be a legally permissible course of action.  However, it would\nnot demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s debts that would fall under the meaning of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 03-10880 (App. Bd. June 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 (App. Bd.\nMar. 27, 2003) (stating an applicant must do more than merely cite the statute of limitations to obtain the full benefit of\nFC MC 6). See also ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003) (\u201c[E]ven if a delinquent debt is legally\nunenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding\nan applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 98-0349 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 3, 1999) (even though an applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were not legally collectible because of the statute\nof limitations, that fact did not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the applicant\u2019s failure to resolve the\ndelinquent debts before the statute of limitations ran). Cf. ISCR Case No. 01-04425 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 17, 2002)\n(adverse Guideline F conclusions possible where applicant chose not to pay her delinquent debts, waited until her\ncreditors ceased trying to collect those delinquent debts, and they were eventually dropped from her credit report.).9\nas a whole,  I conclude FC MCs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple (nine)\n16\ndelinquent SOR debts that were not paid, settled or sufficiently resolved at the time the record was\nclosed.   \nFC MC 3 does not apply and FC MC 4 partially applies to her SOR debts.  Although her\ndebts became delinquent several years ago and were the result of payments to assist her children and\nto make repairs to vehicles needed to transport her to her employment, these changes in\ncircumstances are not the types of unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3.  These\nsituations are not \u201clargely beyond the person\u2019s control\u201d because a prudent persons plans for their\nchildren to attend college and sets aside funds to maintain their vehicles.  There is a paucity of\nevidence showing how she endeavored to pay or resolve her delinquent SOR debts over the last\nthree or four years.  In regard to FC MC 4, there is sufficient evidence that she received and is\napplying her financial counseling.  She is making progress to resolve her delinquent SOR debts.\nBased on the sincerity of her testimony, and the other record indicia of improved financial self-\ndiscipline, I have some confidence that she is on the right track now towards correction of her\nfinancial problems.  I will apply some credit for FC MC 4 under the whole person analysis, infra.\nFC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant\nshowed good faith in the resolution of her debts.   She does, however, receive some credit in the\n17\nwhole person analysis, infra, for the application of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations,\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n18\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n10\nwhich applies to all except three of her unpaid SOR debts.  See S.C. Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530.   The\n18\nSouth Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application\nof the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs.  The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes\nof limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in\nlitigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with\ncertainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend\ntime-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting\non their rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial\nsystem.\n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct.\nApp. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nElimination of all of her delinquent debt load (except for three debts totaling $1,122)\nthrough the statute of limitations and her utilization of W\u2019s debt payment plan have ended her\npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer \u201cfinancially\noverextended.\u201d  However,  it does not negate her past conduct, which caused and then failed to\nresolve her financial jeopardy.  Aside from her conscientious work on her financial problem the last\ntwo months, she has not provided sufficient information about how she attempted to resolve or\nrepay SOR debts.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that a person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information.\u201d  \nTwo personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could potentially raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 2 applies where there has been \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire . . . used to . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness . . . .\u201d  A\nsecurity concern may result under PC DC 3 when an applicant deliberately provides \u201cfalse or\nmisleading information concerning relevant and material matters to a . . . security official . . . or\nother official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness\ndetermination.\u201d  \n\nHer statements about her intentions and state of mind are considered in light of the record evidence of a whole.\n19\nISCR Case No. 04-08934 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2006).  \u201cThe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification were\nnot necessarily overcome by Applicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the government.  Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 01-19513\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004)). \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n20\n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving\nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge\nto conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden\nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9,\n2004)).\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-12329 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 18, 2003) (indicating that inconsistent statements are\n21\nconsidered when determining whether a falsification is \u201cisolated\u201d).\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-16819 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (holding falsification over four years before\n22\nhearing could be considered \u201crecent\u201d).\nFor cases involving an applicant\u2019s disclosure to correct an earlier falsification PC MC 3, rather than PC MC\n23\n2 is the proper guideline.  See ISCR Case No. 02-15003 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-06166\n(App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2001)), see also ISCR Case No. 97-0289 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 1998).   \nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2, 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (indicating when a mitigating condition cannot\n24\nbe fully applied, \u201csome credit\u201d is still available under that same mitigating condition).   \n11\nFor PC DCs 2 and 3, Applicant admitted that she gave a deliberately  false or incorrect\n19\nanswer to Question 22b of her 2004 SF 85P.  Although she did not fully understand the implications\nof Question 22b, she did understand the question itself.  Her confusion and carelessness are\n20\nextenuating, because they show less of an intent to deliberately deceive.  Nevertheless, they do not\nexcuse or mitigate her conduct. \nA security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by evidence of personal conduct\nmitigating conditions (PC MC).  Under PC MC 1, security concerns may be mitigated when the\nderogatory \u201cinformation was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment,\ntrustworthiness, or reliability.\u201d  The allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a are established by substantial evidence,\nand constitute deliberate falsifications.  \n PC MC 2 applies when the \u201cfalsification was an isolated  incident, was not recent,  and\n21\n22\nthe individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.\u201d   PC MC 3 applies when\n23\nthe \u201cindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted\nwith the facts.\u201d  PC MC 2 does not apply, but she receives some credit under the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nanalysis because only one false SF 85P was submitted to the government on August 17, 2004,\napproximately 30 months ago.   Additionally, she made a belated, good-faith effort to correct the\n24\nrecord when she admitted her SF 85P contained incorrect information in her response to the SOR\n\nIn ISCR Case No. 04-08934 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2006) the Board stated that Applicant\u2019s statements about\n25\nhis intent and state of mind when he executed his SF 86 were relevant but not binding information.  Moreover, his\nstatements are considered in light of the record evidence as a whole.  Id. \u201cThe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s\nfalsification were not necessarily overcome by Applicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the government.\u201d Id. (citing ISCR\nCase No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004)).\n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the number of\n26\nviolations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction.  \n12\non September 18,  2006 (albeit after being confronted by the facts), and at her hearing.   Although\n25\nher eventual admission that the clearance entry was false was not \u201cprompt,\u201d she deserves some\ncredit under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for providing accurate information in 2006. \nPC MC 4 applies  when \u201c[o]mission of material facts was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted\ninformation was promptly and fully provided.\u201d  There is no evidence that anyone gave Applicant\nimproper or inadequate advice or suggested that she omit information from her SF 85P.  Security\nconcerns can be mitigated under PC MC 5 when an applicant \u201chas taken positive steps to\nsignificantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  Id.  Under PC\nMC 5, Applicant receives some credit for eventually disclosing her financial problems.  Any steps\nmade toward rehabilitation are insufficient in magnitude and too recent to support full application\nof PC MC 5.  \nCriminal Conduct\nUnder Guideline J, a history or pattern of criminal activity raises questions regarding an\napplicant\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information and creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness.    \nTwo criminal conduct disqualifying conditions (CC DC) could raise a security concern in\nthis case.  CC DC 1 applies where there are \u201cany conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged\u201d and CC DC 2 applies in situations where an applicant has committed \u201ca single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d   \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that she violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by falsifying an answer on her 2004\nSF 85P.  As indicated previously, I find that she deliberately falsified her 2004 SF 85P.  For a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur, however, the falsification must be material.  The Supreme\nCourt defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement\nhaving a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making body\nto which it is addressed.\u201d  See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).\n \nIf Applicant had provided an accurate answer to Question 22b of her SF 85P, this accurate\nanswer was capable of influencing the government to deny her security clearance.  As indicated\npreviously, her delinquent debts were sufficiently recent and serious  to jeopardize her security\n26\n\nThe Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the\n27\nrecency of an applicant\u2019s conduct.  ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)).\nThe Directive does not define \u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d\n28\nconduct.  ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (Judge did not err by concluding drug use not recent\nwith passage of slightly less than two and a half years between last use and hearing) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-10454\nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2004)).  See ISCR Case No. 98-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 1, 1999) (not error for Judge to find\nthat last marijuana use nine months before close of record was not recent). See generally, e.g. ISCR Case No. 98-0394\nat 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (Although the passage of three years since Applicant\u2019s last act of misconduct did not,\nstanding alone, compel the Judge to apply CC MC 1, as a matter of law, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation\nwhy he did not apply that mitigating condition.). \n13\nclearance application.   As such, her omissions to her SF 85P were material.  Accordingly, CC DCs\n27\n1 and 2 apply because Applicant committed a single serious offense, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1001, which is a felony.  \nSecurity concerns based on criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing that it was not\nrecent (CC MC 1).  There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d   If\n28\nthe evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d\nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged\ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d  Id.\nApplicant\u2019s last SOR-alleged incident of criminal conduct was her false statement, when she filled\nout her SF 85P in 2004.  However, the SOR allegation of criminal conduct must be considered\nalong with all the other evidence when applying this mitigating condition.  She was forthright and\ncandid when addressing her culpability at her hearing on November 29, 2006.  However, viewing\nher conduct as a whole, CC MC 1 does not apply.\nCriminal conduct security concerns may be mitigated under CC MC 2 when the \u201ccrime was\nan isolated incident,\u201d or under CC MC 3 when an applicant demonstrates she \u201cwas pressured or\ncoerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person\u2019s life.\u201d  CC\nMCs 2 applies because Applicant committed a single falsification of her SF 85P.  Moreover, she\nwas subsequently honest about her false statement at her 2006 hearing.  Still, CC MC 3 does not\napply because no one caused her or influenced her to commit the criminal conduct.\n  \nSecurity concerns pertaining to criminal conduct may be mitigated under CCMC 4 when\nan applicant \u201cdid not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not\nlikely to recur,\u201d and under CC MC 5 when \u201c[t]here is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.\u201d\nApplicant voluntarily committed the criminal conduct and CC MC 4 does not apply.  The cause of\nthe falsification, an attempt to avoid embarrassment, will not recur because she fully disclosed her\nfinancial information.  CC MC 5 applies because she is successfully rehabilitated.  She understands\nthe importance of being completely honest, and will provide embarrassing, private information in\nthe future.   \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix\n8, at 132. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations,\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n29\n14\nher inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts, and her false statement on her 2004 SF 85P  raise\nserious trustworthiness concerns.  She is currently 53 years old, and sufficiently mature to be fully\nresponsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely\nfashion and her falsification  were knowledgeable and resulted from voluntary choices to purchase\nitems, to obtain services and to not disclose derogatory financial information.  However, her\ninability to repay her debts resulted from funds she provided her children and vehicle problems.\nSince October 2006, she paid eleven debts, disputed two others, and placed the remainder of her\ndelinquent debts into an debt repayment plan. There is substantial evidence of financial\nrehabilitation, positive behavior changes, receipt of financial counseling in 2006, reduction of\noverall debt and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and good budget\ncounseling.  Her falsification occurred approximately 30 months ago and her subsequent statement\nadmitted her omission was deliberate. The motivation for the falsification was to conceal\ninformation about her financial problems to avoid embarrassment, it was not designed to deceive\nor trick the government or her employer into continuing her employment.  The potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant is current on her debt repayment plan,\nand her positive employment history since 1997 supports a determination of trustworthiness. She\nis aware that the government and her employer have the derogatory financial information. The\nlikelihood of recurrence is low. Changes resulting from counseling and greater awareness of\nfinancial responsibilities as well as W\u2019s assistance will result in a trend of improved financial\ncircumstances.  I am confident that she realizes the importance of being accurate and truthful,\nespecially when involved with trustworthiness matters.\n    \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s financial case shows her willingness to apply self-discipline and her\ndebt management plan to resolve her delinquent debts, even to pay some debts she is not legally\nrequired to pay because of the South Carolina 3-year statute of limitations.  She has a debt payment\nplan, and W will maintain contact with her and assist with establishing and reinforcing positive\nfinancial practices.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated the trustworthiness\nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations, personal conduct and criminal conduct.\nSubstantial evidence supports Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility and suitability. I take\nthis position based on the law, my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and\n29\nsupporting evidence, as well as my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities.  For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant\nis eligible for a public trust position. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1v:\nFor Applicant\n\n15\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\nMark W.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact As to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.g in his response to the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 26 years old (GE 4). He married and subsequently filed for divorce in November 2003 (GE 4; GE 5 at 8). On August 11, 1999, he joined the Army (GE 6). He served on active duty for 3 \u00bd years (GE 6). He also served the last three years working for a defense contractor in Iraq. On May 15, 2003, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) imposed under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for failing to obey a lawful order by driving on April 7, 2002, while his driving privileges were suspended. He received extra duty for three days (suspended).

There is an allegation of falsification of the 2005 SF 86.   \n \n2GE 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Aug. 28, 2007). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nFebruary 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n, 2008. \n                                                          \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.4 A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM), dated October 24, 2007, was provided to him, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.5 Applicant provided a letter with two enclosures. Applicant\u2019s submission \nwas received at DOHA on December 18, 2007. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 31\n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.g in his response to the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 26 years old (GE 4). He married and subsequently filed for divorce in \nNovember 2003 (GE 4; GE 5 at 8).  On August 11, 1999, he joined the Army (GE 6). He \nserved on active duty for 3 \u00bd years (GE 6). He also served the last three years working \nfor a defense contractor in Iraq.   \n \n \nOn May 15, 2003, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) imposed \nunder Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for failing to \nobey a lawful order by driving on April 7, 2002, while his driving privileges were \nsuspended. He received extra duty for three days (suspended). See Response to SOR \n\u00b6 1.a.   \n \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4GE 3 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) is not dated or signed. Applicant wrote \u201cI admit\u201d and initialed \nnext to each of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.g. The third page of the SOR is not part of GE 3. He signed a receipt for \nthe SOR on Sep. 16, 2007 (GE 2).  \n \n5Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Oct. 29, 2007; \nhowever, Applicant\u2019s receipt is signed, but not dated. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that \nhe had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nOn March 24, 2003, Applicant received NJP for failure to report for duty on \nFebruary 12, 2003. He received forfeiture of $357, reduction to Private First Class, as \nwell as restriction and extra duty for 14 days. See Response to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nOn February 20, 2003, and on June 24, 2003, Applicant provided urine samples, \nwhich subsequently tested positive for the presence of the marijuana metabolite.  He \nwas also absent from his place of duty from May 12, 2003 until June 22, 2003 (GE 6, \nBlock 29).    \n \n \nHis charges of twice using marijuana, and absence from his place of duty were \nsubsequently referred to a special court-martial. He was sentenced to 45 days\u2019 \nconfinement (GE 5 at 6).6  However, the command chose to accept Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a discharge in lieu of courts-martial under Chapter 10, Army Regulation 635-200 (GE \n6). His discharge certificate, dated July 29, 2003, characterized his service as Other \nThan Honorable (GE 6).  See Response to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e. \n \n \nIn his sworn response to interrogatories, Applicant said he only used marijuana \ntwice in 2003 and was caught both times on urinalysis tests (GE 5 at 2, 4). He claimed \nhis defense counsel said after he served his confinement his record would be expunged \n(GE 5 at 7).  He did not provide a statement from his defense counsel.7   \n \nFalsification of SF 86 \n    \n \nApplicant\u2019s SF 86, executed on November 14, 2005, asked three questions that \nare relevant to the issue of whether Applicant falsified his SF 86: \n \nSection 19: Your Military Record  Have you ever received other than an \nhonorable discharge from the military? \n \nSection 23: Your Police Record For this item, report information \nregardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or \notherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception to this \nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.   \n \n*  *  * \nd. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related \nto alcohol or drugs?8 \n \n6 He said he served 45 days of confinement; however, his confinement is not reflected on his DD \nForm 214 (GE 6). \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s defense counsel probably advised Applicant that the charges would be dismissed by \nthe convening authority when the Chapter 10 was approved, and therefore, he would not have a \nconviction.  A competent defense counsel would not have advised Applicant that there would not be a \nrecord of the offenses, or that his record concerning these offenses would be expunged. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nSection 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity The following \nquestions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity. You are \nrequired to answer the questions fully and truthfully, and your failure to do \nso could be grounds for an adverse employment decision grounds for an \nadverse employment decision or action against you, but neither your \ntruthful responses nor information derived from your responses will be \nused as evidence against you in any subsequent criminal proceedings.  \n \na. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have \nyou illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana . . . ? \n \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to these three questions. \n \nIn his response to interrogatories, Appellant said, \u201cI did not answer the question \ntruthfully because I no longer use illegal drugs and I did not want my company to fire me \nfor a mistake I already paid for\u201d (GE 5 at 7). He said he did not provide accurate \ninformation about his characterization of service because he applied to have his \ndischarge upgraded, and a Veterans Administration representative told him that his \ndischarge would be upgraded before his security clearance was processed (GE 5 at 7). \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant briefly explained his answers to these three \nquestions as follows: \n \nAs the documents show [I] have admitted to the findings that have been \nbrought out concerning my violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice \nand of presenting false information in my application for employment with \nmy present employer.  My reason, though not defensible, is that I needed \nto turn my life around and demonstrate that I could render honorable \nservice to my country. I have served for over three years here in Iraq \nsupporting our military and all of my evaluations have been outstanding.  \nMy supervisors have given their support of me and have submitted written \ndocumentation of their trust and confidence in me and my dedication to \nmy country and job. \n \nApplicant made the false statements \u201cto secure a job to turn around [his] life.\u201d He \ndescribed his offenses on active duty as due to immaturity.  He promised not to violate \nthe trust he received from his employer. \n \nHis employer and a senior government employee provided letters lauding \nApplicant\u2019s stellar performance in Iraq. Applicant was responsible for personnel actions \nand records in Iraq. Applicant is dependable, loyal, honest, professional, diligent and \ntrustworthy. Applicant loves his country, family and supporting our troops.  \n    \n \n \n8 In response to Section 23 of his SF 86, he said he received a court-martial for AWOL (GE 4 at \n23). \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d9 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).10 \n \n9 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n10 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant deliberately provided false information on his 2005 SF 86. His rationale \nfor providing false statements on his SF 86 was to secure employment with a \ngovernment contractor. He also wanted to obtain a security clearance. His attempt to \nobtain these government benefits under false pretenses requires application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16 (a) and 16(b). \n \nIn regard to Applicant\u2019s 2003 misconduct while on active duty in the Army, AG \u00b6 \n16(d)(3) potentially applies.  AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) provides: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of:  \n \n*  *  * \n \n(3) a pattern of . . .  rule violations. \n \nIn regard to the 2003 offenses of using marijuana twice, being absent from his \nplace of duty, failure to report for duty, and disobeying an order, the drug allegations are \nmore appropriately alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement), and all of the UCMJ \nviolations are more appropriately alleged under Guideline J (criminal conduct) because \nall violations of UCMJ punitive articles are criminal offenses.   \n \nMoreover, the most serious UCMJ offenses, using marijuana twice and absent \nfrom place of duty over 30 days are encompassed in the Other Than Honorable \ndischarge issued pursuant to Army Regulation 635-200, Chapter 10. See SOR \u00b6 1.c.  \nTo eliminate the duplication, I find for Applicant under Guideline E for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, and 1.e.  However, I specifically find that AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) applies with respect to SOR \n\u00b6 1.c.   \n  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant\u2019s falsification of his \nSF 86 on November 14, 2005, is recent.11 He did not promptly inform the government of \nthe falsification. He attempted to mislead a security investigation. He did not receive \ncounseling designed to improve his conduct.  Applicant\u2019s claim that his defense counsel \ntold him his record would be expunged is not credible. No one advised him to falsify his \nSF 86. He admitted the false statement at issue, and the falsification of his SF 86 is \nsubstantiated. His statement that he changed does not convince me that similar \nmisbehavior is unlikely to recur. The falsification of his SF 86 casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He failed to tell the truth in 2005 when \nhe thought that he would receive an advantage or benefit by falsification of his SF 86.  \nHis current service in Iraq is an important positive step, but it is not enough to mitigate \nhis conduct. \n \n11 Arguably, AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) does not apply because the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.c could have been \nalleged under a different guideline.  Moreover, the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.c is partially mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n16(c) because it happened over four years ago under unique conditions (while Applicant was on active \nduty), and as such the conduct is unlikely to recur. However, the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.c cannot be \nconsidered piecemeal. The Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a \nreasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. \nBd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When the active duty \nmisconduct is considered in connection with the 2005 falsification of his SF 86, the personal conduct in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c cannot be mitigated under AG \u00b6 16(c). The misconduct on active duty continues to cast doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d  SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 \nby falsifying three answers on his 2005 SF 86. I find that he deliberately falsified his \n2005 SF 86.   \n \nFor a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur, the falsification must be material. \nThe Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 \n(1995): as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of \ninfluencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States \nv. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).    \n \n  \nIf Applicant had provided accurate answers on his SF 86, his accurate answers \nare capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance. His two uses \nof marijuana, absence from his unit in excess of thirty days, and Other Than Honorable \ndischarge received in lieu of courts-martial are important derogatory information that \noccurred about 30 months before he signed his SF 86. The 2003 misconduct overall is \nsufficiently recent (at the time he signed his 2005 SF 86) and serious12 to jeopardize \napproval of his security clearance. Making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is \na serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential sentence includes confinement for five \nyears and a $10,000 fine). Accordingly, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply because Applicant \nviolated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n \n12 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \u2013 31(c) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s false statement occurred on his \n2005 SF 86, which is somewhat recent. It casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. He was not pressured or coerced into making his \nfalse statements on his 2005 SF 86.  He admitted making the false statements, and the \noffense is substantiated.  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d) partially applies. There is some evidence of successful rehabilitation, \nincluding the passage of about 30 months since he completed his 2005 SF 86 without \nrecurrence of criminal activity. He expressed his remorse. He has received some job \ntraining, and has an outstanding employment record serving in Iraq. However, his post-\noffense behavior is insufficient to mitigate the very serious misconduct in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nEventually Applicant disclosed his falsification of his 2005 SF 86 to security \nofficials. His recognition of his misconduct and promise to refrain from future misconduct \nweighs in his favor. His 2003 misconduct on active duty occurred so long ago that it \nwould be mitigated (in February 2008), but for the 2005 falsification of his SF 86. He \nprovided evidence of remorse, or regret concerning his misconduct. He was \nembarrassed by his misconduct, and he recognized the damage his misconduct will \ncause his reputation. His record of good employment weighs in his favor. These factors \nshow some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \n  \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. His  \nfalsification of his 2005 SF 86 and his 2003 misconduct on active duty were \nknowledgeable and voluntary. His misconduct occurred in 2003 and 2005, and is \ntherefore not isolated. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. \nCriminal misbehavior is not prudent or responsible. His falsification of his 2005 SF 86 is \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nparticularly aggravating, and weighs heavily against granting or continuing his security \nclearance. He did not receive counseling or therapy, and may not have a clear \nunderstanding about how to avoid problematic situations and why he engaged in the \nmisconduct. I have persistent and serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n  \nHis criminal misconduct calls into question his current ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct13 \nand criminal conduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d14 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f to 1.h:  \n Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13 Even if I had found \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c because the conduct could have \nbeen alleged more appropriately under a different guideline, I still would have found against Applicant \nunder the Guideline E for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f to 1.h and under the whole person concept. \n  \n14See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following findings: Between 1999 and 2006, Applicant accrued 15\ndelinquent debts in the approximate amount of $11,600.  When confronted by an investigator,\nApplicant stated that she was unable to pay her debts.  In October 2006, she retained an attorney to\nfile for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  Under the plan, she is to pay off her debts in monthly increments of\n$220.  Currently she has made three payments.\nThe Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a\ntrustworthiness determination if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive  \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  Once the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns,\nthe burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors\ndoes not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.\nRather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as\na whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nIn this case, the Judge\u2019s decision includes the following:\nApplicant was aware that her financial delinquencies posed a trustworthiness concern\nas early as November 2005.  She did not take any steps to resolve them until nearly\n15 months later, when she retained an attorney to initiate her . . . bankruptcy filing.\nHer adherence to the . . . debt repayment plan for the past three months is\ncommendable.  However, it remains to be seen whether she can continue to adhere\nto it in light of her past statements that she could not make payments on her\ndelinquencies while staying current on her routine, cost-of-living expenses.  \nDecision at 5.\nThis demonstrates that the Judge did consider Applicant\u2019s efforts at debt repayment.\nHowever, he weighed them against the negative aspects of Applicant\u2019s financial history and\nconcluded that she had not met her burden of persuasion.  Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal that she\nis a loyal employee do not overcome the Judge\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  An applicant with good\nor exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative trustworthiness implications.\nCf., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel FOR APPLICANT Pro Se The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness determination. On August 24, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) 2 advising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On March 19, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness determination. Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30 Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge ignored record evidence as to Applicant\u2019s efforts to pay off her debts; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Finding no error, we affirm. The Judge made the following findings: Between 1999 and 2006, Applicant accrued 15 delinquent debts in the approximate amount of $11,600. When confronted by an investigator, Applicant stated that she was unable to pay her debts. In October 2006, she retained an attorney to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Under the plan, she is to pay off her debts in monthly increments of $220. Currently she has made three payments. The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a trustworthiness determination if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. Once the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). In this case, the Judge\u2019s decision includes the following: Applicant was aware that her financial delinquencies posed a trustworthiness concern as early as November 2005. She did not take any steps to resolve them until nearly 15 months later, when she retained an attorney to initiate her . . . bankruptcy filing. Her adherence to the . . . debt repayment plan for the past three months is commendable. However, it remains to be seen whether she can continue to adhere to it in light of her past statements that she could not make payments on her delinquencies while staying current on her r",

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On August 29, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive. Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on September 10, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 24, 2007. A notice of hearing was\nissued on February 5, 2007, scheduling the hearing for February 27, 2007. Applicant requested a\ncontinuance, which was granted. Another notice of hearing was issued on March 6, 2007,\nrescheduling the hearing for March 23, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. The Government offered three exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE)\n1 through 3, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified and offered seven exhibits that were\nmarked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on April 10, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice be taken of the facts contained in\nHearing Exhibit (HE) IX. The source documents for the facts are U.S. Department of State,\nBackground Note: Iran, dated October 2006 (HE I); U.S. Department of State, Consular Information\nSheet: Iran, dated April 3, 2006 (HE II); U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Iran, dated\nOctober 10, 2006 (HE III); Congressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress,  Iran: U.S.\nConcerns and Policy Responses, updated January 5, 2007 (HE IV); U.S. Department of State,\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2005: Iran, dated March 8, 2006 (HE V); U.S.\nDepartment of State, Country Reports on Terrorism 2005, dated April 2006, Chapters 3 and 6 (HE\nVI); Testimony of Director of Central Intelligence, Porter J.

In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant served in the United\nStates Army from 1992 to 1997. She was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant (E-6). She is a\nhigh school graduate, with technical and community college credits. Applicant is married. She has\na child from her first marriage, and has two stepchildren.  \n2\nApplicant was born in Iran. Her parents left Iran in about 1970 or 1971, and went to Canada.\nHer father came to the U.S. in about 1973. Applicant and her mother followed her father several\nmonths later in about 1974. Her father became a U.S. citizen in 1980, and her mother in 1982. As\na minor, Applicant was naturalized when her parents were naturalized. She is unsure specifically\nwhen this occurred. Applicant visited Iran with her parents in 1976, when she was six years old. That\nwas the last time she has been to Iran.  \n3\nApplicant\u2019s only sibling was born in the U.S. in 1979. Her parents never registered the sibling\nas an Iranian citizen. Applicant\u2019s father does not have any relatives in Iran. His parents are both\ndeceased, and buried in the U.S. He has a strong hatred of the Iranian regime. Applicant\u2019s father is\na successful businessman. He has also not been back to Iran since 1976.4\nApplicant\u2019s mother has family members living in Iran. Her brother, Applicant\u2019s uncle, is a\ncitizen and resident of Iran, as is his son. Applicant\u2019s uncle is a retired elementary school assistant\nprincipal. His son is a high school student. Applicant\u2019s uncle and his son used to periodically visit\nthe United States. Applicant occasionally saw him on his visits. Her last contact with her uncle and\nhis son was in 2004, when they came to the U.S. to visit. She has had no contact of any kind with\nher uncle or his son since that visit.  \n5\nApplicant\u2019s aunt, her aunt\u2019s husband, and their four children are citizens and residents of\nIran. Her aunt is a retired elementary school principal. Her husband is a retired high school physical\neducation teacher. One cousin is an elementary physical education teacher, two cousins are college\nstudents, and one cousin is a high school student. Applicant has not seen her aunt since Applicant\nvisited Iran in 1976, when she was six years old. Applicant has never met her aunt\u2019s husband or\nchildren. She has not spoken to her aunt since 2002, when her grandmother passed away, and a call\nwas made from her parent\u2019s house to offer condolences.  \n6\n\nTr. at 70-73; 152-155.\n7\nTr. at 137-138; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2.\n8\nTr. at 141-142, 159; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2.\n9\nTr. at 114-115; 122-123, 160-161; GE 2.\n10\nTr. at 76-81.\n11\nTr. at 82, 121; AE F.\n12\n5\nApplicant\u2019s mother has visited her family in Iran on two occasions since 1976. She traveled\nto Iran in about 2002, when her mother passed away. She returned to Iran in 2006, to visit her brother\nwho had a heart attack. She made a point not to contact Applicant while she was in Iran. Applicant\u2019s\nmother talks to her family in Iran by telephone every several weeks.7\nApplicant was stationed overseas with the U.S. Army from 1994 through 1997. On\napproximately three to four occasions, Applicant switched price tags on merchandise at the military\nexchange in order to buy the merchandise at a lower price. Between 1997 and 1999, Applicant\nswitched price tags at a department store on about 10 to 15 occasions.  \n8\nApplicant was arrested in February 2000, at an exchange on a military installation, and\ncharged with larceny of property belonging to the exchange. Applicant stole several clothing items\nand two bottles of perfume. She also switched prices on several clothing items. She entered a pre-\ntrial diversion program in which she was ordered to complete 200 hours of community service,\nattend a class on theft, and pay $100 in court costs. Charges were dismissed in 2001, upon\nApplicant\u2019s completion of the requirements of her pre-trial diversion program.  \n9\nAfter Applicant was arrested in 2000, she informed security personnel at her company of her\narrest. The other incidents of theft and shoplifting were divulged by Applicant pursuant to a\nbackground investigation interview. Applicant has not been arrested, shoplifted, or committed any\nother theft since her 2000 arrest.  \n10\nApplicant\u2019s husband also works in the defense industry, and has held a security clearance for\nmany years. Applicant and her husband started dating in about November 2000, and married in 2003.\nShe was very forthright with her husband, telling him early in their relationship about her criminal\nrecord. He testified about the changes in Applicant, and provided examples of her honesty, including\nreturning to a store to correct an undercharge by the store.  \n11\nApplicant and her husband are financially very sound. They both earn good salaries, and have\nno credit card debt. They own their house, with substantial equity. They have a solid investment\nportfolio, including stocks, 401(k) plans, and IRAs. Applicant\u2019s stepchild is attending college. All\nthree of their children have a funded college education plan.12\nApplicant has worked for her current employer since 1997. Her criminal past is known in her\ncompany to key personnel. Her facility security officer (FSO) testified that she and the company\u2019s\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) were both aware of Applicant\u2019s past.

He has\nobserved Applicant and her husband in social settings and believes she is a dedicated wife with\nstrong family values. He recommends her for a position of trust and a security clearance.13\nApplicant\u2019s witnesses and numerous character letters from family, friends, and people who know\nher from work or the Army attest to her character, dedication, loyalty, trustworthiness, and ability\nto handle classified information. Some, but not all, of her character references are aware of the\nallegations in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s father is also aware of Applicant\u2019s shoplifting crimes.  \n14\nApplicant received numerous awards and accolades while in the Army. Her military and\ncivilian job performance evaluations are excellent. She is also very active in the community, actively\ninvolved in sports, youth activities, and a number of charities.15\nIran is a country that is clearly hostile to the United States.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic\n16\nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated that the United\nStates \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from Iran.\u201d17\nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in which\nShi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political authority is vested in\na learned religious scholar.18\nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as:\n\u2022\nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\n(WMD);\n\u2022\nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism;\n\u2022\nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and\n\u2022\nIts dismal human rights record.  \n19\nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq is also a concern.  \n20\n\nHE VI at 171, 173; HE IX at 3.\n21\nHE V; HE IX at 5.\n22\nHE II; HE IX at 5-6.\n23\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002).\n27\n7\nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism.\nIran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups, and routinely provides unique safe haven,\nsubstantial resources and guidance to terrorist organizations. State sponsors of terrorism pose a grave\nWMD terrorism threat. Iran presents a particular concern, given its active sponsorship of terrorism\nand its continued development of a nuclear program. Iran is also capable of producing biological and\nchemical agents or weapons. Iran could support terrorist organizations seeking to acquire WMD.21\nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the\nIranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, including\nof minors;  disappearances; religious persecution; kidnappings; torture; arbitrary arrest and detention,\nincluding prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe restrictions on civil liberties\n- speech, press, assembly, association, movement and privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of\nreligion; official corruption; violence and legal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic\nand religious minorities, and homosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n22\nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens, particularly those born in Iran, to\nconsider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. Iranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, and the children\nof such persons, are considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize\ndual citizenship. As a result, U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the\nIranian government.  \n23\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n24\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n25\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n26\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n27\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\n\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n28\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n29\n8\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n28\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n29\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the\nDirective.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nA history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\nApplicant admits she committed larceny on a number of occasions between 1994 and 2000.\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admissions of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2\n(A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) both apply. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was not recent) and CC MC\nE2.A10.1.3.6 (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation). Applicant was arrested in\nFebruary 2000. There is no evidence of any criminal activity since then. Applicant now has a stable\nfamily situation. She is a pillar of her community, and is highly regarded at work. She and her\nhusband both have good jobs, with substantial salaries. They are financially secure. Her husband\nrecalled instances where Applicant has proven her honesty. Her testimony was sincere and she\ndisplayed the appropriate remorse for her crimes. I find the criminal behavior was not recent and\nthere is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. CC MC E2.A10.1.3.1 and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6\nare applicable.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\n\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1 and E2.A2.1.3.1.\n30\nISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).\n31\n9\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.1 (Reliable, unfavorable\ninformation provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances) and\nPC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual\u2019s\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may\naffect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible\nto blackmail) apply to Applicant\u2019s criminal activities.\nI considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC ) E2.A5.1.3.5) (The individual\nhas taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation,\nor duress). Applicant\u2019s evidence of rehabilitation, as discussed above, is also relevant to this\nmitigating condition. Key people in her life, including her family and employer, are aware of her\ncriminal actions. Applicant has significantly reduced her vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or\nduress. PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 is applicable.\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nA security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family, including cohabitants, and\nother persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens\nof the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with\ncitizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security\ndeterminations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure. \nA Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) may arise if ([a]n immediate family\nmember, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of,\nor resident or present in, a foreign country) FI DC E2.A2.1.2.1. \nApplicant\u2019s extended family in Iran do not qualify as immediate family members, which is\ndefined as \u201cspouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters.\u201d  The Appeal Board on\n30\nnumerous occasions has indicated that there is a presumption that an applicant has close ties of\naffection or obligation with immediate family members, and the family members of an applicant\u2019s\nspouse. That presumption does not extend to aunts, uncles, and cousins.  Applicant has had only\n31\nbrief sporadic contact with her uncle and his son over many years. Her contact with her aunt and her\naunt\u2019s family have been much less. She has never met her aunt\u2019s family. Applicant last saw her aunt\nin 1976, and has had no other contact with her aunt, other than a brief phone call upon her\ngrandmother\u2019s death. There is no evidence to support a finding of familial affection or obligation\n\nId.\n32\n10\nbetween Applicant and her extended family in Iran.  No Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition\n32\nhas been established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \nApplicant has extended family members in a country that is very hostile to the United States.\nThe administrative notice documents describe Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of mass destruction; Iranian support and involvement in international terrorism; Iran\u2019s\nviolent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and Iran\u2019s dismal human rights record. \nI also considered that Applicant\u2019s contact with her extended family members in Iran have\nbeen minimal. She does not have close ties of affection or obligation with them. Applicant barely\nknows her uncle and his son, and really does not know her aunt or her aunt\u2019s family. Her family\nmembers are involved in education, and have little involvement with the government of Iran. Her\nmother visited Iran on two occasions, in about 2002, when her mother passed away, and again in\n2006, to visit her brother who had a heart attack. She made a point not to contact Applicant while\nshe was in Iran. While this underscores the brutal nature of the Iranian government, it lessened\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress. Applicant left Iran when\nshe was very young, and returned on only one occasion, more than 30 years ago, when she was six\nyears old. All her immediate family members are in the United States, and are U.S. citizens.\nApplicant and her husband are financially secure. After weighing all the evidence, I find that\nApplicant has established that her minimal contact with extended family members in Iran does not\ncreate a heightened vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct has been contradictory. She was very highly regarded in the Army, and\nin her workplace, yet she on many occasions stole from exchanges and department stores. Her\ncharacter evidence speaks well of her. Also telling is her husband\u2019s accounting of specific instances\nof her honesty. After considering all the evidence, and assessing her credibility and sincerity, I am\nsatisfied that Applicant is rehabilitated. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non her criminal conduct, personal conduct, and foreign influence.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\n\n11\nParagraph 1.

Mitigation has not been adequately established.  Clearance\nis denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The\nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nrequired under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, denied or revoked.\nOn October 27, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and\nelected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing. The case\nwas assigned to me December 15, 2006. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 8, 2007.\nThe hearing was conducted on February 15, 2007.  The Government introduced four exhibits\n(GX) 1-4. After the hearing, the Government timely submitted an additional exhibit (GX 5).\nApplicant testified, called an additional witness, and introduced two (2) exhibits (AX) A and\nB).  After the hearing, Applicant submitted two more exhibits (AX C and D).  All exhibits\nwere admitted without objection.  The transcript was received on February 27, 2007.   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 27-year-old computer specialist for a defense contractor.  The SOR\ncontains seven  (7) allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct); one (1) allegation\nunder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct); and one (1) allegation under Guideline H (Drugs),\nApplicant admits allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.g. and 3.a.  He denies allegations 1.c., 1.e., 1.f.\nand 3.a. All answers are accompanied by explanations. Only the specific admissions are\naccepted as such and deemed to be findings of fact.    \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional\nFINDINGS OF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n\n3\n1.a. - As Applicant admits, he was disciplined for Time Card Violations in October\n2004.  He did not fill out his timecards every day as required by company policy and was\ndetected three times in 60 days.\n1.b. - Applicant falsified material facts on his March 18, 2005 security clearance\napplication (SF 86), in which he responded to Question 27 \u201cYour Use of Illegal Drugs and\nDrug Activity  Since age 16 or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter, have you [used\nillegal drugs],\u201d to which he answered \u201cNo,\u201d and deliberately failed to mention his use of\nmarijuana in 2000 and again in 2005. \n1.c. - Applicant used marijuana in May 2005, after he had completed his SF 86 on\nMarch 18, 2005.  His use of marijuana occurred during a period when he already had a DoD\nsecurity clearance. \n1.d. - Applicant had sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 16 in about June\n2005.  Applicant was 25 at the time.\n1.e. - Applicant resided with a friend in about the fall of 2001 and had a sexual\nrelationship for about three months with his daughter, who was between the ages of 16 and\n17.  Applicant was about 21 to 22 at the time.   \n1.f. - Applicant moved into the home of his girlfriend\u2019s family in about 1998, and\ncontinued a two-year sexual relationship that had begun earlier.  The female was under 18\nduring the relationship.  \n1.g. - Applicant was denied a security clearance by the National Security Agency\n(NSA) in about October 2005, due in part, to the information set forth in allegations 1.b., 1.c.,\n1.d., 1.e., and 1.f., above.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of material facts about his marijuana use through\nJanuary 2005, in his March 18, 2005 security clearance application (SF 86), as alleged in\n1.b., above, constitutes a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001, a felony.\nGuideline H (Drugs) \n3.a. - Applicant used marijuana in at least 2000, January 2005, and May 2005. \nPOLICIES\n\n4\n \nEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination\nbased upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate: (1) Nature and\nseriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) Frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (3) Age of the applicant. (4) Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences involved; (5) Absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) Probability that\nthe circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive\n5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the\nultimate question of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an\nindividual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in\nspecific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific\nallegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the\nGovernment has the initial burden of proving those controverted facts alleged in the\nStatement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden\nof persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within\nspecific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive\n5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a 27-year-old computer specialist.  The overall record compels the\nconclusion that Applicant has a history of conduct that indicates a serious lack of judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n1.a. - Applicant\u2019s admitted failure to comply with company timecard rules in about\nOctober 2004, is relatively minor in itself, but taken in context, becomes part of a series of\nconduct that brings his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness into question.\n1.b. - The material falsification of his answer to Question 27 on his March 18, 2005\nSF 86, in which he omitted any mention of his marijuana in 2000 and at least in January\n2005, is both serious and current.  It is clear that the falsifications occurred long after\nApplicant had first obtained DoD security clearance, after he began processing for a position\n\n The \u201c2207/02/07\" date appears on the top left of the first page of each SF 86, but neither\n1\none is signed or dated on the last page, and there is no evidence either one was ever submitted to\nDoD.\n5\nwith the NSA, and after he signed an agreement not to use illegal drugs while employed with\nthat agency (Tr at 22, 23). Applicant admits the false answer, but denies it was deliberate.\nApplicant claims the false answer was \u201can unfortunate oversight on [his] part\u201d (Response).\nHe claims that on an earlier SF 86, he had answered \u201cYes,\u201d but no such SF 86 has been\nproduced.\nAt the hearing, Applicant did submit two other SF 86s (AX A and AX B), both dated\nFebruary 7, 2007 on the upper left corner of the first page.  Neither SF 86 is signed nor dated\nat the bottom of the last page.  The only apparent differences are that they contain different\naddresses  at Item 4 on the first page, and (2) as to Item/Question 27, the answer in AX A is\n\u201cNo,\u201d while the answer in AX B is \u201cYes,\u201d and cites marijuana use on three occasions\nbetween June 1, 2001 and January 15, 2005.  The two SF 86s, including the one in which a\n\u201cYes\u201d answer appears are from 2007, almost two years after the date of the 2005 SF 86 cited\nin the SOR.   Therefore, they do not support Applicant\u2019s claim in his response to the SOR\n1\nthat he had told the truth on a \u201cprevious\u201d SF 86. \nI have carefully considered the testimony of Applicants witnesses, a security officer\nfrom Applicant\u2019s company (Tr at 64-68).  The essence of the testimony is that another\nsecurity officer, who assisted Applicant with the preparation of the SF 86, cause confusion\nthat led to the \u201cNo\u201d answer being entered as to Question 27.  The testimony is intended to\nshow what Applicant\u2019s state of mind was when he entered the false answer.  I conclude,\nhowever, that the testimony does not accomplish that goal.  As discussed above, the dates of\nthe SF 86s contradict any link in causation and, most important, Applicant\u2019s signature at the\nend of the SF 86 (GX 1) certifies that he read and agreed with all entries on the SF 86.\nClaiming that he simply missed the \u201cNo\u201d answer to Question 27 lacks any support in the\nrecord, particularly when considered along with other evidence of his poor judgment,\nunreliability, and untrustworthiness.\n1.c. -Applicant now claims his last use of marijuana was in January 2005. Although\nApplicant denies the allegation in the SOR that he used marijuana as recently as May 2005,\nwhich would be after he had completed his March 2005 SF 86, the record support the SOR\nallegation.  In the National Security Agency (NSA) Clearance Decision Statement, dated\nOctober 25, 2005, denying Applicant access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI),\nApplicant is quoted as stating that between 1995 and May 2005 (while possessing SCI\nclearance granted by NSA, and after his SCI indoctrination under the \u201cCCA program,\u201d he\nused marijuana on three occasions (GX 4).  That document specifies that Applicant \u201clast used\nmarijuana in May 2005\" (Id.).   \nI note also Applicant\u2019s testimony that he may have used marijuana once after January\n2005, but that he \u201chonestly [doesn\u2019t] remember\u201d (Tr at 52).  He concedes, however, that his\nlast use occurred \u201cafter he had been given a clearance\u201d in 2002 and after he had signed\nNSA\u2019s Personnel Security Policy Advisory form (Id.) \n\n6\nUnder allegations, 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f., the record supports the conclusion that Applicant\nhad consensual sex with three different underage females, in 1998, 2001, and June 2005,\nwhen Applicant was about 18, 21, and 25 years old, respectively.  I have carefully considered\nhis most recent explanations, including a claim that at least one girl\u2019s parents knew of the\nsexual relationship and did not object to it.  \nI have compared Applicant\u2019s recent statements with his earlier statements to NSA.\nI give more weight to the earlier statements since they were given before Applicant realized\nthat his conduct might be viewed as raising questions about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.\n1.g. - Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct and marijuana use, as described in detail in GX 4,\ncompelled NSA\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was not eligible for SCI access.  The record\nsuggests no reason to reject NSA\u2019s evaluation and the recently obtained evidence makes the\ncase against Applicant even stronger. \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nDisqualifying Conditions: (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities; and (d.3) A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nMitigating Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: None that are\nestablished by the record.\nBased on the totality of the record, I conclude that all of the allegations under\nGuideline E are supported by the record and that none of them have been mitigated by\nanything Applicant has said or done.  I agree with NSA\u2019s evaluation, but my decision is\nbased on my independent evaluation of the evidence, including the most recent documents\nand testimony. \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n2.a. - The deliberate falsification of his answer to Question 27 constitutes a violation\nof 18 U.S.C. 1001, a felony.\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness.  By it\u2019s very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDisqualifying Conditions: (a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n\u00a9 Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.  Mitigating Condition: None that are\n\n7\nestablished by te record evidence.\nGuideline H (Drugs) \n3.a. - Applicant used marijuana on a number of occasions, in 2000, January 2005, and\nlastly, in about May 2005.  The overall evidence establishes the dates of use shown above\nand at least suggests there may have been more drug use. \nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith law, rules, and regulations.\nDisqualifying Conditions: (a) any drug abuse; \u00a9 illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia; and (g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \nMitigating Conditions: None that are established by the record.\nOverall, the record evidence establishes that Applicant committed the sexual,\npersonal, drug-related, and criminal misconduct alleged in the SOR; also that he knew and\nhad reason to know that his answer to Question 27 was false.  Looking at Applicant in the\ncontext of the whole person concept, he has not come close to overcoming the evidence\nsupporting the Government\u2019s concerns, as stated in the SOR.  It is basic to the security\nclearance adjudication process that the ultimate burden of proof is on the Applicant to\ndemonstrate that he is eligible to possess a security clearance.  The record compels the\nconclusion that Applicant has simply not demonstrated he currently possesses the good\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation\u2019s\nsecrets.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive\nare hereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.              \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.e.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.              \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.g.           \nAgainst the Applicant\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n8\n           \nSubparagraph 2.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\nGuideline H (Drugs)\nAgainst the Applicant\n        \nSubparagraph 3.a               \nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in June 2005. In July 2006, the bankruptcy was\ndismissed. Applicant owes the IRS for unpaid income taxes for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002,\n2003, and 2004.  She has resolved or entered into repayment plans pertaining to several of her debts.\nHowever, she continues to have issues dealing with financial irresponsibility.  Her student loan\naccount is past due and six debts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved. Trustworthiness concerns\nremain due to Applicant's financial problems and her deliberately misleading statement to an\ninvestigator pertaining to the status of her Chapter 13 debt repayment plan. She has not met her\nburden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations and personal\nconduct. Applicant's eligibility for an assignment to a sensitive position is denied.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \"Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\" dated November 19, 2004.\n Tr. at 6; Gov 1.\n2\n Tr. at 63. \n3\n Tr. at 64.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn October 3, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust. The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\"); and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines,\napproved December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006.  On February 1, 2007, DOHA issued\n1\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in\nessence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\nIn a sworn statement dated March 21, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nelected to have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Her response was\nreceived by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals on March 23, 2007. On April 16, 2007,\nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing pursuant to paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive. The case was\nassigned to me on August 3, 2007.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 6, 2007, scheduling\nthe hearing for August 29, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled. The government offered nine\nexhibits which were admitted as Government (Gov) Exhibits 1-9 without objection.  Applicant\noffered 10 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-J without objection.  The\nrecord was held open until September 12, 2007, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit\nadditional documents.  On September 5, 2007, Applicant requested an additional week to submit\nadditional documents.  Her request was granted until September 19, 2007. Applicant timely\nsubmitted a ten-page document which was marked and admitted as AE K without objection. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on September 12, 2007.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i and admits to all the\nremaining SOR allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a\nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings\nof fact.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who\nis seeking a position of public trust.  She is single and has no children.  She is trained as a nurse and\n2\n3\nis currently a case manager with a healthcare company that works on a government contract.  She\nhas worked for the company for approximately two years.   \n4\n\n Gov 1. \n5\n Gov 1 at question 19. \n6\n Gov 7.\n7\n Gov 4; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2; AE B.\n8\n Tr. at 26-27; Gov 8. \n9\n Tr. at 28-31; Gov 9. \n10\n4\nOn October 3, 2005, Applicant completed a public trust position application (SF 85-P).  In\n5\nresponse to question \"19. Your Financial Record - Bankruptcy, Liens, Judgments. In the last 7 years\nhave you, or a company over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared\nbankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a legal judgment rendered against you for a debt?\"\nApplicant listed a bankruptcy filed on August 10, 2005.  \n6\nApplicant filed for bankruptcy on June 29, 2005.   The following debts were included in\n7\nApplicant's Chapter 13 bankruptcy: a $500 account owed to a loan company (SOR \u00b6 1.b, Tr. at 46;\nGov 6 at 5); a $100 account owed to a water company (SOR \u00b6 1.c, Tr. at 47-48); a student loan\naccount, approximate balance $12,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr. at 48; Gov 3 at 7); a $1,000 medical account\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. at 49; Gov 6 at 5); a $2,000 medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Tr. at 49-50; Gov 6 at 5);\na $1,105 credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Tr. at 50; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 2 at 3); a $14,873 automobile\nloan (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Tr. at 51-53; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 3, 10; AE D); a $10,000 automobile\nloan (SOR \u00b6 1.i; Tr. at 51-53; Gov 2 at 2); a $3,000 mortgage account (SOR \u00b6 1.j; Tr. at 53; Gov 2\nat 2); a $700 credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.k, Tr. at 53; Gov 6 at 5); and a $2,071 computer account\n(SOR \u00b6 1.l; Tr. at 54; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 6 at 2).  \nApplicant also owes the Internal Revenue Service approximately $24,672 for unpaid taxes\nand penalties for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.8\n \nOn February 22, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator in conjunction with her\nbackground investigation. The investigator asked her for more information about her bankruptcy.\nShe told the investigator that she filed for bankruptcy in July 2005. She also told him that she pays\n$715 a month to a bankruptcy trustee, and is current on her payments.  \n9\nOn February 24, 2006, the investigator reviewed Applicant's bankruptcy records at the U.S.\nBankruptcy court. The records indicate that Applicant was required to pay $822 per month toward\nher Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  She owed a total of $46,854. She began making payments on August\n8, 2005.  The record indicates that Applicant was approximately $1,861 in arrears as of February\n2006.   \n10\nAt hearing, Applicant admits that when she was interviewed by the investigator, she was\naware that she was behind at least one payment towards her Chapter 13 plan. She thought that she\n\n Tr. at 43-44; 64-65.\n11\n Tr. at 65. \n12\n Tr. at 66. \n13\n Gov 7. \n14\n Tr. at 44-45.\n15\n Tr. at 45; Response to SOR; see also Gov 5 at 2.\n16\n Gov 6 at 13. \n17\n Tr. at 45. \n18\n Gov 4, AE B. \n19\n AE B. \n20\n Tr. at 55. \n21\n Tr. at 48-49; Gov 8. \n22\n5\ncould rectify the matter by making a payment bringing her Chapter 13 plan up-to-date.  She admits\n11\nthat part of the reason she did not disclose that she was behind on her Chapter 13 payment plan was\nout of concern over her trustworthiness position.  In the future, should she fill out a trustworthiness\n12\napplication, she intends to provide truthful information. She has learned a painful lesson.13\nApplicant voluntarily dismissed the bankruptcy in July 2006.   She decided to sell her\n14\ncondominium and pay for some debts with the profits of the sale.  She made approximately $30,000\non the sale of the condominium.  Her bankruptcy attorney advised her to make payments towards\n15\nher car, the IRS debt and a $300 state debt. He advised her not to arrange payments with her other\ncreditors unless they contacted her.  She paid $5,000 towards her auto loan and $8,000 towards her\n16\nfederal taxes.   She paid the $300 state tax debt and $500 towards some credit cards. She spent all\n17\nof the $30,000 that she made from the sale of her condominium.18\nOn November 6, 2006, a federal tax lien in the amount of $24,672 was entered against\nApplicant for unpaid income taxes for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  On\n19\nDecember 5, 2006, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS.  She agreed to pay\n$600 per month due on the 10th of each month with payments starting on January 10, 2007.  She\n20\nclaims that she is making timely payments towards her repayment agreement. Two weeks prior to\nthe hearing, she sent a request for revision to the IRS asking that her payments be reduced to $500\nper month.  No documentation was provided indicating that Applicant is making timely payments\n21\non her IRS debt. \nApplicant testified at the hearing that she requested a forbearance on her student loan for\napproximately one year.   She testified that prior to her forbearance request, she paid approximately\n22\n$160 per month towards her student loans. It was her belief that the forbearance request was\n\n Tr. at 67. \n23\n AE K at 6. \n24\n AE K at 7-8. \n25\n AE K at 2, 8. \n26\n Tr. at 45. \n27\n AE D; Gov 6 at 3, 9; AE K at 9. \n28\n Tr. at 52-53.\n29\n Tr. at 53; Gov 6 at 11-12\n30\n Tr. at 49-50. \n31\n Tr. at 63.  \n32\n Tr. at 57. \n33\n Tr. at 54.\n34\n6\napproved.  Post-hearing, she provided a copy of a request for forbearance, dated July 31, 2007.\n23\n24\nThe balance on her student loan is $18,545.80. She is approximately $1,249 past due on her student\nloan payments.   She is attempting to work a payment plan to catch up on her arrears.\n25\n26\nApplicant's automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.h) is now up-to-date. She paid $5,000 toward the\nautomobile loan after her bankruptcy was dismissed.  She has been making regular payments and\n27\nthe automobile loan is no longer delinquent.  The automobile loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is a\n28\nduplicate of the automobile loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.29\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j which was related to condo fees and other expenses was\nsatisfied at the time Applicant sold her condominium.  \n30\nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l remain unresolved. None of\nthe creditors have contacted Applicant and she has not contacted the creditors in order to resolve\nthese accounts.  She claims that the accounts with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are the same.  There is\n31\nnothing in the record evidence that indicates these are two separate medical accounts.  I find for\nApplicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \nApplicant states that cause for her financial problems was due to overspending and living\nbeyond her means.  She attended two financial counseling sessions approximately two years prior\n32\nto filing bankruptcy.  Based on the advice of her attorney, she is waiting for her creditors to contact\n33\nher before attempting to resolve her delinquent accounts.34\n\n Tr. at 56; Gov 8 at 2.\n35\n AE K at 10. \n36\n See Tr. at 55-58, AE B and AE K at 9. \n37\n AE H. \n38\n AE J.\n39\n AE A. \n40\n AE C; AE I. \n41\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n42\n7\nApplicant's monthly take home pay is $3,200.  Post-hearing, she submitted a budget. Her\n35\ntotal monthly expenses are approximately $2,350.  Based on these figures, she has approximately\n36\n$850 left over each month after expenses. Her budget does not include her $600 monthly payment\ntowards the IRS debt or her monthly car payment of $471.90.  Including the monthly tax payment\n37\nand the car payment, Applicant has a negative balance of $221.90. \nApplicant's supervisor comments that Applicant has consistently demonstrated \"a high degree\nof competency, dependability, and professionalism in her daily work\"  She states she is a valuable\nemployee.   Applicant often gets favorable remarks from clients.  She has received several letters\n38\n39\nof appreciation and awards.  Her performance reports have been favorable. Her most recent\n40\nevaluation which closed out on March 31, 2007, indicates that she consistently meets and often\nexceeds day to day expectations.41\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n42\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines,\neffective September 1, 2006.  The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines sets forth personnel security\nguidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.\nThe adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n43\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n44\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n45\n Id.\n46\n Id.\n47\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n48\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n49\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n50\n8\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.43\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.44\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n45\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n46\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n47\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n48\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n49\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n50\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n51\n9\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n51\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations,\nand Guideline E - Personal Conduct. \nFinancial Considerations\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a)\n(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b619(c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply to Applicant's case. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts including a $24,000 tax debt for\nunpaid taxes related to tax years 1999 - 2004. In addition, she currently has six unresolved delinquent\ndebts with a total approximate balance of over $6,400. Many of these debts have been delinquent for\nseveral years. She is in the process of requesting a forbearance on her student loan account. Currently,\nthe student loan account is past due $1,249.\nFC DC \u00b6 19(c) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence\nof any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt)\nalso applies.  Applicant admits that her financial problems were the result of her irresponsible and\nspending habits and living beyond her means. \nSeveral Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply.  Applicant\nhas a history of financial irresponsibility spanning several years. She still has significant financial\nproblems. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC \u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\nThere is no evidence to support the application of FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant's problems were not caused by\ncircumstances beyond her control.  \n FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) also does not apply.\nApplicant received financial counseling a few years prior to filing bankruptcy.  Although, she has\nresolved some of her accounts and has taken steps to enter into the payment plans with the IRS and\nher student loans, it is too soon to conclude that her financial problems are under control based on her\ntrack record of financial irresponsibility. She recently entered into a  payment plan with the IRS.\nApplicant's student loan accounts are currently delinquent and not in forbearance. Applicant has six\n\n10\nother unresolved delinquent accounts. Her monthly budget indicates that her expenses are more than\nher income. As such, I conclude her financial situation is unlikely to be resolved in the future.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is applicable, in part. Applicant has brought her automobile loan payments\nup to date.  She resolved the debt is SOR \u00b6 1.j. She is attempting to repay her IRS and student loan\ndebts.  However, several accounts remain unresolved and Applicant has made no attempt to resolve\nthe accounts. As such, I give FC MC \u00b6 20(d) less weight.\nAlthough Applicant has taken steps to resolve her financial problems, her financial situation\nremains unstable. She has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern.\nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\n \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.  \nIn this case, Applicant told the investigator assigned to conduct her background investigation\nthat she was current on her Chapter 13 repayment plan while knowing that she was at least one\npayment behind.  She told the investigator that she was current because she thought she could bring\nthe Chapter 13 repayment plan up to date. She was concerned about her application for a\ntrustworthiness position. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately\nproviding  false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator,\nsecurity official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative) applies.\nApplicant maintains that she did not intend to mislead the investigator about the status of her Chapter\n13 payment plan, but admits that she knew her payments towards the Chapter 13 plan were delinquent\nwhen she was interviewed by the investigator.  She told him that she was current on her payment plan\ndespite knowing this. Although, she claims she had no intent to mislead, she deliberately provided\nfalse information to the investigator.  \nI find none of the personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC) apply to Applicant's case.\nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment,\nor falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not apply. Applicant never attempted to\ncorrect the misleading information provided to the investigator. \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable.\nApplicant's admission that she misled the investigator casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness\nand good judgement. Her explanation that she intended to make payments towards the Chapter 13 to\nbring it current is not a sufficient justification for lying to the investigator. Applicants are required\nto provide truthful and correct information to the government during their background investigations.\n\n11\nApplicant did not meet her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by her\ndeliberate misleading statement provided to the investigator conducting her background investigation.\nGuideline E is concluded against Applicant.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. While Applicant has favorable performance reviews and is highly regarded by her\nsupervisors and coworkers, trustworthiness concerns remain due to her deliberate misleading\nstatements to the investigator conducting her background investigation, her history of financial\nirresponsibility, and her current unstable financial situation. Based on the evidence in the record, it\nis not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

To make ADP III\n1\npositions subject to trustworthiness determinations, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense approved use of the procedures in\nDoD Directive 5220.6 to resolve referred ADP III contractor cases for trustworthiness determinations. To apply the Directive\u2019s\nsubstantive guidelines to ADP III cases would require at least some covered nexus in the Directive itself, which neither Executive\nOrder 10865 nor the procedural guidance in the Directive addresses.   While not a perfect blend of procedural/substantive\nguidance, the combining of the Directive\u2019s procedures with the substantive guidelines in DoD 5200.2-R provides the best\navailable framework under the circumstances for ensuring due process to ADP III applicants seeking trustworthiness\ndeterminations.\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a highly regarded customer service representative  for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts during a brief period of unemployment, ensuing surgery\nand tightened finances associated with her shortage of funds.  With barely enough income to support\nher child and herself, she has made little progress in paying her old acknowledged debts, many of\nwhich are apparently barred by applicable statutes of limitation. While she claims debt counseling\nin her FORM submission, she failed to document or explain the counseling and repayment efforts\nshe has committed to.  Although she is regarded as reliable and trustworthy by her friends and\ncolleagues, it is too soon to determine whether she will be able to make any material progress in\naddressing her delinquent debts.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative determination of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a trustworthiness\ndetermination clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 25, 2006, and elected to have her case decided\non the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on\nDecember 28, 2006.  Applicant submitted information in response to the FORM within the 30 days\nafforded her to provide supplemental documentation regarding the issues.   Included in the packet\nof information provided by Applicant were a cover letter of January 10, 2007, certificates of\nrecognition and training and two character references. The case was assigned to me February 23,\n2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nThe SOR relies on DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  Because the\nprocedural rules of the Directive provide no express coverage of ADP trustworthiness\ndeterminations, the substantive guidelines of Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R,\nPersonnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, will control.   From a\n1\npractical standpoint, though, it makes no difference which set of financial guidelines apply to the\n\n3\ncovered allegations.  For there are no material differences in the treatment of financial considerations\nbetween the guidelines in the Directive and those in the Regulation. \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts: She is\nalleged to have incurred five delinquent debts altogether (with several placed in collection in 2002\nand before), which exceed $27,000.00 in total.  For her response to the SOR,  Applicant admitted\nher debt-related allegations, and provided explanations.  She claimed payment of the debt covered\nby creditor 1.a and her intention to contact the remaining creditors covered in the SOR.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 30-year-old customer service representative of a defense contractor who seeks\na trustworthiness determination.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nBetween 1999 and 2006 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts with five creditors.\nAltogether, she accrued over $27,000.00 in debts which were either placed in collection or charged\noff.  She claims she paid the debt covered by creditor 1.a of the SOR but provides no documentation\nverify her payment of the $186.00 debt.  This debt is no longer listed in either of her latest credit\nreports (see items 6 and 7) and is credited with being discharged.\nApplicant furnished no payment documentation regarding any of her remaining five debts\ncovered in the SOR.  Of these listed debts, the largest is a deficiency balance in the amount of\n$19,783.00 that resulted from a foreclosure of a mobile home that Appellant had purchased in\nOctober 1998 (one month after the birth of her son).  At that time, she was employed by a mortgage\ncompany and enjoyed good credit.  But after four years of employment with this mortgage company\n(1997-2000), she lost her job and was out of work for a couple of months.  With a young son to care\nfor, and earnings shortfalls attributable to her period of unemployment and surgery in 2000, she\nencountered difficulties paying her bills and decided to sell the mobile home.  Her sale efforts\nincluded add placements in her local newspaper and requests for sales assistance with the company\nshe purchased the home.  She claims she was hampered in finding prospective buyers by the location\nof the trailer (on rental property).\nAfter months of unsuccessful efforts to sell the home, Applicant called the company holding\nthe loan again and asked for sales assistance.  She was furnished no marketing assistance from the\ncompany, and before she could find a buyer, the company repossessed the trailer.  After foreclosing\non the trailer, the company, in turn, demanded over $19,000.00 to cover the deficiency on the loan\nbalance.  Without the means to cover this loan balance, Applicant ignored the demand and permitted\nthe statute of limitations governing this debt to run.\nBesides the deficiency balance with Portfolio on her mobile home repossession, Applicant\naccrued delinquent debts with AFNI ($80.00), Credreapp ($4,364.00), and Receivables Management\n\n4\nCorporation ($2,615.00).  She tried contacting these creditors about payments in May and June of\n2005 and did make arrangements with one of the delinquent creditors to pay off the debt in $110.00\nmonthly installments.  After struggling with these payments for several months, she found that she\ncould not continue making them any longer and remain timely with her current creditors.  So, she\nceased making payments with this creditor and suspended payment efforts with her other delinquent\ncreditors as well.  With her family obligations and limited resources, Applicant found her repayment\nefforts with her older creditors to be too overwhelming to know where to begin.\nRecently, Applicant initiated credit counseling and cites her counseling with an identified\ncredit counseling firm.  It is difficult to gauge what progress she is making with her counseling firm,\nsince she doesn\u2019t provide any material documentation of her counseling efforts.\nApplicant is credited with completing a number of training courses with a local medical\ntechnical college and has received numerous certificates acknowledging her outstanding performance\nin 2003 and 2004.  She is highly regarded by her managers and colleagues who have worked with\nher.\nPOLICIES\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the Defense Office\nof Hearing and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,\nCommunication and Intelligence (ASDC31), entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA),\nwhich gave DOHA responsibility to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel\nworking on unclassified Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines covered in both DoD  Directive 5220.6 and DoD Regulation\n5200.2-R list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA\ncases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a\ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the\n\"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a trustworthiness determination\nshould be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines,\njudges must take into account the pertinent considerations for making a whole person assessment\nof the individual seeking a trustworthiness determination. In determining whether the applicant\nqualifies for a sensitive position under the trustworthiness standards of DoD 5200.2-R, the applicant\nmust be provided the due procedural protections contained in the Directive.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable\ncriminal acts.\n\n5\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's application for a trustworthiness determination may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position depends, in large\npart, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge\nmay draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain an ADP I/II/III position.  The required showing of material\nbearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant\nhas actually abused a trust relationship before it can deny or revoke a trustworthiness determination.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to adhere to principles of trust.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant to establish his or her\ntrustworthiness  through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a highly regarded customer service representative for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts during periods of financial set backs primarily attributable\nto her brief loss of employment in 2000.  With the limited resources available to her, she has not\nbeen able to sustain any repayment programs on her major debts without jeopardizing her current\nobligations, which include caring for her nine-year old son.  To be sure, most of her old debts\n(including the deficiency balance on a repossessed mobile home) appear to be barred by controlling\nstatutes of limitation in her state of residence (South Carolina).  Still, she acknowledges most of the\nlisted debts and has recently explored debt counseling arrangements with uncertain results. \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended that he or she is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts,\nwhich heretofore she has not been in a position to address, warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 1 (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).\nExtenuating circumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s loss of employment and ensuing\nsurgery in 2000, and added child rearing obligations.  MC 3 of the financial considerations guideline\n(the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\n\n6\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation) is clearly applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nBecause of the limited income available to Applicant over the past six years, Applicant has\nnot heretofore been in a position to address most of her old debts.  Several of Applicant\u2019s listed debts\nwere charged off before 2002.  The remaining debts (save for one) have been placed in collection:\none (creditor 1.b) since May 2004, another (creditor 1.c) since February 2001, a third debt (creditor\n1.d) since October 2002, and a fourth debt (creditor 1.e) since May 2002.  None of Applicant\u2019s listed\ndebts reflect any collection action by the individual creditors involved.  Based on this record, all of\nApplicant\u2019s debts appear to be barred from collection by the pertinent statute of limitation in South\nCarolina for debts.  See S.C. Code Ann. Sec. 15-3-530.  While statutes of limitation in general are\nconsidered important policy tools for discouraging plaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and\npromoting finality in litigation, they have never been equated with good-faith efforts to repay\noverdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004) (quoting ISCR\nCase No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).\nApplicant does not assert relevant statutes of limitation in South Carolina in her defense.  She\ncited her continuing counseling efforts with a debt counseling firm but provides no documentation\nto corroborate and explain the extent of her counseling efforts.  Without a formal plan of repayment\nfrom her counseling firm, it is not possible at this time to predict what progress Applicant can\nrealistically be expected to mount in addressing her outstanding debts.  Whatever the problems\nApplicant has encountered in working out a repayment arrangement with her counseling firm and\nreceiving counseling from the dame firm, she has not articulated them sufficiently to permit\nassessments of her current repayment efforts. \nWithout some type of documented repayment stream with her creditors, or at the very least\nan executed debt consolidation repayment/counseling plan to reinforce her repayment commitments,\nshe may not yet claim good faith mitigation benefits.  MC 6 of the guidelines for financial\nconsiderations (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) can have no application for Applicant in this case.  Her failure to document any\nreceived counseling with the debt counseling firm she has been corresponding with precludes her\nreliance on MC 4 (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) of the guidelines as well.\nHolding a favorable trustworthiness determination involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.   Financial stability\nin a person cleared to access information covered by privacy rights is required precisely to inspire\ntrust and confidence in the holder of the trustworthiness determination. \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledging her debts incurred during extenuating circumstances and\nexploring debt consolidation with financial counselors to address her debts reflect responsibility and\nan encouraging beginning for her.  She failed to document or explain the nature and extent of her\ndebt counseling efforts, however, and at this time, she is not demonstrably committed to a repayment\nprogram that is likely to generate tangible results in the foreseeable future.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, the positive judgment and trustworthiness impressions she has made on her\n\n7\nfriends and colleagues, her educational achievements, her solid performance evaluation, and her still\nincomplete repayment initiatives she is able to document at this time, Applicant fails to mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns related to her debts.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by the financial considerations guideline.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nfactors enumerated in the preamble of Appendix 8 of DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, conclusions and\nguidelines listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following formal findings:\nFINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied. \nRoger C.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 37 years old, married, with three children from her two marriages.  She works\nfor a defense contractor in the health insurance business.  She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001\nto discharge about $22,000 in delinquent debts.  Now she owes about $33,000 in delinquent debts.\nShe repaid some debts, has an installment payment plan for another 28 debts, and has seven debts\nunpaid, though she and her husband have the savings to repay them over the next year.  Applicant\ndid not mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concern.  Her eligibility for a\ntrustworthiness determination is denied.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trustworthiness for Applicant .  On August 25, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of\n1\nReasons  (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\n2\nF (Financial Considerations) the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on November 27, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.  On June 28, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness\ndetermination for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were\nadmitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2007.  Applicant\ncorrected the spelling of her name on her Answer, and I used that spelling in the caption of this\ndecision. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 37 years old, married with three children, and works for a defense contractor in\nthe health insurance industry.  Since February 2005, she has worked as an image clerk.  She has a\nsecond job cleaning various parts of a local hospital.  She works from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. five days a\nweek, and part-time on Sundays, at these two jobs.  She has diabetes and high blood pressure.  She\nwas married to her first husband from 1993 to 1995, which marriage produced her two oldest\nchildren.  She married her second husband in November 2004, and has one child from that marriage.\n(Tr. 33, 35, 36, 45, 46, 70, 71; Exhibit 1)\nWhile a single parent from 1995 to 2004, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on August\n14, 2001.  She listed debts totaling $22,110.42 that were discharged in bankruptcy on November 22,\n2001.  Currently, she has 43 delinquent debts totaling $33,302.61 listed in the SOR.  She and her\ncurrent husband earn a net joint monthly income of $4,500.  After paying their bills, including rent,\nauto purchase payment, insurance, food, child expenses (day care is provided by Applicant\u2019s mother\nwho lives with her), and other monthly expenses, Applicant and her husband have about $1,292 per\nmonth of discretionary income.  From that amount her husband sends $200 to his mother in Mexico.\nApplicant also spends about $200 monthly on weekly family entertainment excursions for pizza and\nmovies.  Their remaining  net monthly discretionary income is $892.  This money Applicant\u2019s\nhusband sends to a savings account in Mexico.  He now has $4,000 in that account.  They do not\nhave a savings account in a U.S. bank.  The money sent also pays for medical care for Applicant\u2019s\n\n3\nfather who recently had a stroke.  Applicant\u2019s husband is an illegal alien in the United States.\nApplicant claims he overstayed his visa in error.  Applicant paid an attorney $5,000, plus another\n$1,200 before this hearing, to represent her husband in an attempt to improve his immigration status\nto avoid deportation.  Applicant also retained an attorney in an attempt to terminate her former\nhusband\u2019s visitation and custody rights because he does not pay child support, or have contact with\nhis two children.  Applicant did not state what fee she pays that attorney.  Applicant\u2019s husband has\nfour credit cards which he pays in full each month. (Tr. 33-41, 47-54, 60-63; Exhibits 1-3)\nOf her 43 delinquent debts, Applicant repaid eight of them.  In February 2006, she paid, the\n$124 for an overdrawn check (1.i).  She paid the judgment obtained against her by a former landlord\nin July 2004, by garnishment from her paycheck.  That repayment was completed in July 2007 (1.j).\nShe paid in March 2006, four speeding tickets unpaid since 2005, totaling $432 (1.aa, 1.cc, 1.dd,\n1.ee).  Finally, she repaid her higher education loans totaling $1,446 in April 2007 (1.o, 1.p). (Tr. 21,\n32, 57, 58; Exhibits 2, 3, A, D-G; Answer)\nApplicant has an installment payment plan under her state\u2019s law.  She paid an attorney $800\nand paid the trustee $2,500 under the plan (which is not bankruptcy under Federal law) to administer\nthe plan for at least the next two and a half years.  Applicant pays the trustee $603 each month to be\ndivided among four creditors under the plan, who are owed 28 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.\nSince March 2007, Applicant has made those payments.  The first debt in the plan is $10,183 to a\nbank for the balance of a loan on a repossessed automobile (1.nn).  The second debt is to a telephone\nservice provider for three debts totaling $1,767 (1.f, 1.g, 1.bb).  The third debt is to a pay day loan\ncompany for three loans totaling $2,364.40 (1.l, 1.m., 1.n).  The fourth group of debts is owed to a\nhospital for medical services provided when Applicant did not have medical insurance and suffered\ntwo miscarriages in 2004.  Those debts total $12,615.41 (1.d, 1.k, 1.q to 1.y, 1.gg to 1.qq). (Tr. 13-\n17, 23-27, 45; Exhibits 1-3, B, C, E)\nApplicant has not paid seven delinquent debts totaling $2,751, and are as follows: (1) $565\nto a collector (1.b); (2) a dental bill for $200 (1.c); (3) a credit card debt of $425 (1.e) on a card\nwhich Applicant no longer has (Applicant does not have any credit cards presently); (4) a car\ninsurance debt of $170 (1.h); (5) a utility bill of $303 (1.z); (6) a pay day loan for $600 (1.ff); and,\n(7) $488 to a collector for a check cashing company (1.rr).  Applicant has not discussed paying these\ndebts with her husband, in part because,\u201cWe have to make payments on stuff.\u201d  Applicant is not\npaying these debts until she repays the debts under the installment repayment plan managed by the\ntrustee.  She did not include these debts in that plan because her monthly payments would rise to\n$900 and be more than she can afford. (Tr. 30, 31, 42, 43, 45; Exhibits 2, 3, E)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\n\n4\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\n\n5\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F:Financial Considerations: The Concern: An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. E2.A6.1.1\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations:  Applicant has a history of spending beyond her means and lacks\nability to repay the debts.  The 2001 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy discharged $22,110.42 in debts .  She\naccumulated those debts between 1995 and 2001.  That is a large sum of delinquent debts for anyone\nto accumulate. \nAfter her bankruptcy discharge, Applicant proceeded to accumulate another $33,302.61 in\ndelinquent debt.  She obviously has a difficult time managing money.  She has taken no courses or\ncredit counseling to learn how to live within her income at age 37.  She married again in 2004 to a\nman whose immigration status now makes him illegal.  Between the two of them, they earn $4,500\nper month, for a total of $56,000 annually.  That income should be sufficient for them to live\ncomfortably and pay their debts.  Her husband sends their monthly net income s to Mexico to be used\nfor his family.  The $4,000 saved in the Mexican savings account would pay Applicant\u2019s remaining\nseven delinquent debts of $2,751. \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations\nE2.A6.1.2.1), and DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts E2.A6.1.2.3) apply.  Since 2001,\nApplicant accumulated substantial debt that she cannot repay.  Her payment priorities over the years\ndemonstrate amply her inability to manager money and pay her debts in a reasonable time period.\nApplicant repaid some debts, and to establish under her state\u2019s law an installment payment\nplan protected by that state law.  About $12,000 of Applicant\u2019s debt arose from medical care\nobtained when Applicant had no medical insurance.  She had two miscarriages in 2004.  Those\nexpenses are mitigated by those medical emergencies and her present plan to repay them as they\nrepresent factors beyond her control.  Two Mitigating Conditions (MC) may apply in this case.  MC\n3 (Conditions resulting in the behavior were beyond Applicant\u2019s control because of unemployment\nand divorce E2.A6.1.3.3), and MC 6 (Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts E2.A6.1.3.6) are the two MC which might apply. \n\n6\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s history of debt accumulation, being approximately $55,000 in the past\n12 years, shows a significant inability to control her spending.  It also shows she accumulates debt\nmuch faster than she could ever hope to repay it in a reasonable time or by a reasonable plan.  \nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\" trustworthiness decision. Directive\nE2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case,\nI have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct on debt accumulation and repayment is one of spending more than she\nearns, and not being able to repay it within a reasonable time.  She has engaged in this course of\nconduct over a 12-year period.  The repeated nature of her conduct is serious and shows a lack of\ncontrol and good judgment.  She is mature and should know that such conduct will result in financial\ndifficulties. \nThe debts listed in the SOR include pay day loans with high interest rates, telephone bills,\na utility bill, unpaid rent, and other debts which she could have avoided with a little forethought and\nplanning.  However, based on her long history of fiscal irresponsibility and an outstanding balance\nof about $27,000, I am not certain that her problems are under control and will not recur.  She needs\na record of debt repayment performance to persuade me otherwise.\nTherefore, after considering all of the evidence and applying all of the DC and MC, and then\nevaluating the \u201cwhole person\u201d that Applicant presented at the hearing, I conclude the financial\nconsiderations trustworthiness determination against Applicant.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\nconcept\u201d against Applicant based on her entire history of debt accumulation, demonstrated inability\nto repay these debts in a timely and reasonable process, and sizeable amount of debt currently\nremaining to be paid.  Applicant\u2019s spending priorities contribute to her financial delinquencies, and\nshe has not obtained any professional credit or debt counseling to educate herself so she can avoid\nthe problem in the future.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.rr:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\n\n7\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nHer application for a trustworthiness determination is denied.\nPhilip S.

On August 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as\namended.  The SOR detailed reasons under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal\nConduct) why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.  DOHA\nrecommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be granted.\nOn September 11, 2006, and October 30, 2006, DOHA received unsigned Answers from\nApplicant.  On or about November 21, 2006, Applicant submitted to DOHA a properly executed\nAnswer and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  On December\n26, 2006, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 14 Items,\nand mailed a copy of it to Applicant two days later.

He also indicated that his wages were being garnished to pay off the debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c for\n$750 and 1.i for $1,017.  However, he did not provide any documentation to verify his assertions\nregarding those three debts, or information pertaining to the other twelve debts.  Credit reports dated\nFebruary 8, 2006, July 20, 2006, and December 18, 2006, verified the delinquent debts, and indicated\nthat some of them date back to 1999 (Items 9, 11 and 12).\nParagraph two of the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his security clearance application.\nbecause he failed to disclose 13 debts listed in the SOR that were more than 90 and 180 days\u2019\ndelinquent.  In his November 2006 Answer, he denied that he falsified his application and stated that\nhe answered \u201cto the best of my knowledge, but if I did state something otherwise, it was not\nintentional.\u201d (Item 7).  In his June 2006 answers to Interrogatories, he stated, \u201cI thought I listed all\nof them. If I didn\u2019t, I listed them to the best of my knowledge which I\u2019m sure all of my accounts are\nover 180 days.\u201d (Item 10 at 8).  He did not know which ones were more than 90 days, but knew he\nowed money on all of them.  He decided to list the two largest outstanding debts (Id. at 9).  He also\nindicated that he was looking for a debt consolidation program to assist him in resolving his financial\nobligations (Id. at 11).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information, sets forth criteria, which must be evaluated when determining security\nclearance eligibility.  Within those adjudicative guidelines are factors to consider in denying or\nrevoking an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and\nfactors to consider in granting an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Mitigating\nConditions).  By recognizing that individual circumstances of each case are different, the guidelines\nprovide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to\nreach a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nThe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision.  Section E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all\nappropriate variables in a case as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  In evaluating the disqualifying and\nmitigating conduct an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of\nparticipation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in the individual.  Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must\ninclude consideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also\nconsideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information.  Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  The\n\n4\ndecision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a judgment about an applicant\u2019s\nloyalty.  Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 7.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  Departments of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988).  The Directive presumes a rational connection between past proven conduct under any\ndisqualifying conditions and an applicant\u2019s present security suitability.  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at\n2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\ncorresponding burden of rebuttal shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nclearance.\u201d Id.\nBased upon the allegations contained in the SOR and a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole, the following adjudicative guidelines are pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations:  A security concern may exist when an individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nUnexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct:  A security concern may exist when conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered all facts in evidence and legal standards, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept,\nand concluded the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nBased on the evidence, the Government established a disqualification under Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2. 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), apply to this case.\nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations, dating back to 1999, and\nevidenced by his admissions and credit reports. Many debts remain delinquent and unpaid. DOHA\u2019s\nAppeal Board has concluded that \u201c[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does\nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access\nto classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 98\u2013810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000).\nThe Government having established potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to\n\n5\nApplicant to mitigate or rebut the allegations.  Six Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions\n(FC MC) under the Guideline are potentially applicable:\n1. E2.A6.1.3.1. (The behavior was not recent).\n2. E2.A6.1.3.2. (It was an isolated incident).\n3. E2.A6.1.3.3. (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation)).\n4. E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control).\n5. E2.A6.1.3.5. (The affluence resulted from a legal source).\n6. E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts).\nAfter reviewing all of those conditions, I conclude none apply.  Applicant\u2019s debts began in\n1999 and continued into the present; hence ,FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1. is not applicable.  Because he has\nmore than one debt FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. cannot apply.  Applicant did not provide any information\nindicating that the accumulation of his debts was beyond his control, which is necessary to trigger\nthe application of FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3.  Nor did he submit any evidence that he received credit\ncounseling and his finances are under control as required under FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4.  Affluence is\nnot an issue in this matter, hence, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.5. is not applicable.  Applicant indicated that\nthree debts were being resolved through garnishments, which does not represent of a good-faith\neffort to repay or resolve his debts, as contemplated under FC MC E2.A6.1.3. 6.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleged that Applicant falsified his SCA by failing to disclose many of his\ndelinquent debts, which constituted a potential disqualification under Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities).  Applicant denied those allegations.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as\na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.\n17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant stated that he did not intentionally omit information about twelve delinquent debts\non the e-QIP.  He answered the questions \u201cto the best of [his] knowledge\u201d at the time and listed the\ntwo largest debts.  He did not disclose the other debts, because he was uncertain of the length of their\ndelinquency at the time.  Based on his truthful disclosure of the larger debts and his age, I find his\nexplanations credible and conclude that he did not intentionally falsify his application for a security\nclearance.  Hence, the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are decided in his favor.\n\n6\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, I also\nconsidered factors included within the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, such as Applicant\u2019s young age and\nhis recent employment with a federal contractor.  I took into account the fact that he does not have\na criminal record or other problems that raise security concerns.  However, while he expressed an\ninterest in resolving his financial obligations in June 2006, he did not provide any evidence that he\nhas implemented a solid budgetary plan, which would resolve or pay the delinquent debts alleged\nin the SOR, and establish a track of financial responsibility to mitigate the security concerns raised\nby his history of unresolved debts and credit problems.  Given the absence of such evidence, I am\nconcerned that he has not demonstrated sufficient reliability or good judgment to assure the\nGovernment that similar problems will not recur.  For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not\neligible for access to classified information and all allegations under Paragraph 1 of the SOR are\nconcluded against him.  Accordingly, Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by\nfinancial considerations, but did mitigate those raised by his personal conduct.  Guideline F is\ndecided against him, and Guideline E is decided for him. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.1.o: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.  Clearance is denied.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 29, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \n1\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 1  is not supported by record evidence and\n2\ntherefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis\nis not supported by record evidence and therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding\nerror, we remand the case to the Judge.\nDepartment Counsel implicitly challenges the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings in his\nargument that the Judge\u2019s failure to make findings of fact concerning the geopolitical situation in\nNigeria impairs her analysis of FIMC 1 as well as of the whole person.  Department Counsel\ncontends that such record evidence as \u201cthe deteriorating security situation in Nigeria,\u201d human rights\nabuses, and government corruption raise security concerns which the Judge\u2019s decision fails\nadequately to address.  \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument is persuasive.  \u201cGuideline B cases should be made to the\ngreatest extent possible in the context of current political conditions in the country at issue.\u201d  ISCR\nCase No. 05-11292 at 4 (App. Bd.

He has also renounced his Nigerian citizenship.  His foreign ties pose no\nsecurity risk. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn August 3, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 10, 2006, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on September 8,\n2006.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 22, 2006, scheduling the hearing for October\n30, 2006.  At the hearing the Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented ten\nexhibits and  testified on his own behalf.  The record was left open to allow the Applicant to submit\nadditional documentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit consisting of four\npages.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on November 13, 2006.\nOn August 16, 2000, a memorandum was issued by Mr. Arthur Money, Assistant Secretary\nof Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, clarifying \u201cthe application of\nGuideline C to cases involving an Applicant\u2019s possession or use of a foreign passport.\u201d  The\nApplicant received a copy of this memorandum with the SOR.  (Government Exhibit 2).  \nOn December 29, 2006, the Administrative Judge issued a favorable decision in this case.\nThe Appeal Board  remanded the favorable decision of the Administrative Judge on July 24, 2007,\ninstructing the Judge to issue a new opinion that \u201cshould include a more detailed analysis under both\nGuideline B and the \u201cwhole person,\u201d which explicitly takes into account the situation existing in\nNigeria insofar as it has a bearing on Applicant\u2019s eligibility to hold a clearance.  Further, it should,\nas appropriate, detail and explain Applicant\u2019s pertinent qualities, characteristics, and circumstances\nwhich are the basis for the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 06-17001 at 2 (App.Bd. Jul.\n24, 2007).)     \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and\nthe testimony.  The Applicant is 25 years of age and holds a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.\nHe is employed as a Software Engineer.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference for\nanother country over the United States.\nThe Applicant was a dual citizen of Nigeria and the United States.   He was born in Lagos,\nNigeria in 1981.  His mother won the lottery for a green card under the Diversity Program sponsored\nby the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.  The green card entitled his mother,\nher spouse and each of her children under the age of twenty-one to receive permanent residence visas\nin the United States if they so chose.  The visas will expire in 2008.  The Applicant took advantage\n\n3\nof his visa and moved to the United States in May 1998, at the age of sixteen.  He became a United\nStates citizen on February 11, 2005.  He currently possesses a United States passport that will expire\nin 2010.   \nOn August 15, 2005, when the Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the\nDefense Security Service, he stated that he also possessed a Nigerian passport that was issued on\nSeptember 13, 2000, and was renewed in about May 2004.  This passport was scheduled to expire\nin September 11, 2010.  The Applicant had planned to use his Nigerian passport in order to travel\nto Nigeria to visit family members there.  Since moving to the United States in 1998, the Applicant\nhas traveled to Nigeria on one occasion.  When he did,  he used both his United States passport and\nhis Nigerian passport to enter and exit the country.     \nThe Applicant believes that he renounced his Nigerian citizenship when he took the oath to\nbecome a United States citizen.  (Tr. p. 56).  However, after learning of the provisions of the Money\nMemorandum, he went a step further and renounced his Nigerian citizenship and surrendered his\nNigerian passport by making a formal request by letter to the passport office at the Federal Ministry\nof Internal Affairs in Nigeria on October 12, 2006.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\nThe Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and a brother are all citizens and residents of Nigeria.  His\nparents and sisters all hold United States permanent resident alien status cards that will expire in\n2008.  His eldest brother, an accountant for a private bank in Nigeria, and who was over the age of\ntwenty-one at the time of the green card lottery, did not get a permanent resident alien status card,\nand will remain in Nigeria.  The Applicant\u2019s parents are planning to move to the United States before\n2008.  The Applicant contacts his parents in Nigeria about once or twice a month and on holidays.\n(Tr. p. 49).  He has little or no contact with his eldest brother.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s father is a retired civil servant, an administrative clerk, who worked for the\nMinistry of Defense in Nigeria over ten years ago.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  Prior to that, he worked\nin the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, the Ministry of Finance, and the\nMinistry of Labor and Productivity. Since retiring from government service, he has had no contact\nwith the Nigerian government.  His father receives a small pension, about $100.00 a month, from\nthe Nigerian government, however, it is the money from his mother\u2019s business that provides most\nof their financial support.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D and E).  The Applicant\u2019s father resides far away\nfrom the region in Nigeria that involves conflict and unrest and he does not travel there.  His father\nlives in an area of Nigeria which is known as a safe place, close to the American consulate, and\nwhere 99% of the American people in Nigeria live.    \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother is a travel agent and owns her own business.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nB and C).  Both of his sisters have already moved to the United States and made it their permanent\nhome.  One of them is an accountant, the other is a student currently in the process of applying to\ngraduate school.  One of his sisters is already a United States citizen.  \n\n4\nThe Applicant\u2019s parents own the house that they live in.  Under Nigerian law, when they\nmove to the United States, the Applicant\u2019s eldest brother will inherit the property.  The Applicant\nhas no foreign financial interests what so ever and has no intentions of ever moving or living in\nNigeria. \nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Nigeria.  The fact that\nNigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states, which has a very poor human rights record.\nHuman rights violations include police brutality, armed robberies and murders to name a few.  I have\nconsidered the fact that Nigerian Government officials at all levels commit serious abuses.  The fact\nthat Nigeria has terrorists activities, presents potential danger to Americans who travel there, and is\nrampant with crime and instability.  The overall deteriorating security situation in Nigeria, the human\nrights abuses and the government corruption elevates the cause for concern in the case.    \nThe Applicant has discussed the fact that he is applying for a security clearance with his\nparents and the situation of potential duress.  He told them that if he were ever approached by a\nforeign power of any sort and asked to reveal classified information, he would not reveal it under any\ncircumstances.\nMitigation.\nLetters from the Applicant\u2019s father confirms his past employment with the Nigerian\ngovernment.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G and H).\nLetters from the Applicant\u2019s Supervisor, his Manager, and the Facility Security Officer\ncollectively indicate that the Applicant is highly regarded for his intelligence, motivation, and\nintegrity.  He is a strong team player and has been promoted as a result of his outstanding work\nperformance.  He is also an individual with high moral standards.  He is considered trustworthy, very\nresponsible and extremely conscientious about his work.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J). \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could\nraise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent\ncriterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any\ncase, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be\nassumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.\nBased on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this\ncase are:\nForeign Preference\n\n5\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the\nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful\nto the interests of the United States.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n1. The exercise of dual citizenship;\n2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\n4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship\nForeign Influence\nA security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family, including cohabitants, and other\npersons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens\nof the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with\ncitizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security\ndeterminations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection\nor obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons,\ndaughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power\nor in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose\nbetween the loyalty of the person(s) involved and the United States.\n3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n\n6\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting\nthese personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline\nB (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse\nconduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant\n\n7\ncan be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and\nhaving assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative Judge concludes\nthat the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's\nforeign contacts have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified\ninformation.  \nThe Applicant was a dual citizen of Nigeria and the United States who possessed a Nigerian\npassport.  Disqualifying Conditions, (1) The exercise of dual citizenship and (2) Possession and/or\nuse of a foreign passport apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions  (1) Dual citizenship is based\nsolely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country and (4)  Individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship are applicable.\nSince learning that possession of a foreign passport is not permitted when holding a security\nclearance, in compliance with the provisions of the Money Memorandum, he surrendered his foreign\npassport to the Nigerian authorities.  He has also renounced his Nigerian citizenship.  Under the\ncircumstances, the Applicant has done everything possible to be in compliance with the requirements\nof the directive and the Money Memorandum.  Accordingly, he has clearly demonstrated an\nunequivocal preference for the United States.  Under the circumstances of this case, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline C. \nWith respect to Guideline B, the overall deteriorating security situation in Nigeria, the human\nrights abuses and the government corruption in Nigeria certainly elevates the cause for concern in\nthe case.  However, under the particular facts of this case, the evidence establishes that the Applicant\nis not vulnerable to foreign influence. With the luck of the draw, through a green card lottery,\nsponsored by the Immigration and Naturalization service, the Applicant and his immediate family,\nincluding his mother, father, and two sisters won a Diversity Visa, issued only to those who qualify\nas productive members of society, and were given the privilege of entering the United States on a\ntemporary visa with the ability to obtain a permanent one.  The Applicant\u2019s mother, father and sisters\nall have permanent visas.  Both of his sisters already reside in the United States.  One of his sisters\nis already a United States citizen.   The other sister plans on becoming one as soon as she is able.\nHis parents are planning to permanently move to the United States before 2008.  The Applicant and\nhis family hold the privilege of immigrating to the United States in high esteem and would do\nnothing to jeopardize it.  \n  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating whether the Applicant meets\nthe qualifications for access to classified information.  The Applicant\u2019s qualities, characteristics and\ncircumstances have been considered.  The Applicant came to the United States at the age of sixteen\nand was the first in his family to make the United States his permanent home.  Since coming to the\nUnited States, the Applicant has been extremely productive.  He has achieved his college degree by\ngetting student loans from the United States that he is currently paying back.  He has established a\n\n8\nprofessional career working for a defense contractor in defending this country and in an effort to give\nback to the United States for the privileges it has provided him.  He has  excelled in accomplishing\nthe American dream.  Among other accomplishments, he was invited to participate in an academic\nexcellence program for outstanding students.  He has demonstrated his loyalty and commitment to\nthe United States.  He has expressed strong positive feelings toward the United States and is grateful\nfor the opportunities that he has found both through his ability to obtain higher education and in his\nprofessional development.  He is well respected by his superiors and professional colleagues.  The\nApplicant is a credible, intelligent, and forthright young man.  Most importantly, he understands his\nresponsibilities to the United States when holding a security clearance and will never under any\ncircumstances improperly divulge classified information.  The current political conditions in Nigeria,\nalthough horrible, do not adversely effected the Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. \nUnder Guideline B, Disqualifying Condition (1) an immediate family member, or person to\nwhom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present\nin, a foreign country applies.  However, Mitigating Conditions (1) A determination that the\nimmediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant,\nor associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between the loyalty of the person(s)\ninvolved and the United States and (3) Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual\nand infrequent are applicable.  The Applicant\u2019s two sisters have already moved to the United States.\nOne has already become a United States citizen.  The other will apply to be one as soon as she is\neligible.  The Applicant\u2019s parents are planning to move to the United States in the very near future.\nHis only family member who will remain in Nigeria is his brother.  The Applicant has little or not\ncontact with him.  \nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s father was at one time employed with the Nigerian Government,\nhe is now retired and has been for over ten years.  His small pension from the Nigerian Government\nprovides little in the way of financial support.  In fact, the Applicant\u2019s father is planning to move to\nthe United States to make it his permanent home.  The Applicant\u2019s father is no longer associated\nwith the Nigerian government, or is he in a position to place foreign influence on the Applicant, or\nin a position to be exploited by the Nigerian Government in a way that could force the Applicant to\nchoose between loyalty to him and loyalty to the United States.  Except for his brother who will\nremain in Nigeria, the Applicant has for the most part cut all ties with Nigeria.  The Applicant\nunderstands his responsibility to the United States in holding a security clearance.  Based on the\nforegoing, the Applicant\u2019s relatives do not raise a security concern and Guideline B is found for the\nApplicant.   \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline\nC and B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has\nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines C and B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n9\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    \nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant \n1.b.: For the Applicant\n1.c.: For the Applicant \nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n2.a.: For the Applicant \nSubparas.\n2.b.: For the Applicant \nSubparas.\n2.c.: For the Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn February 15, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a \ndetermination be made on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) on March 20, 2008. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant \non March 25, 2008. He received it on April 7, 2004.  Applicant had 30 days from the \nreceipt of the FORM to submit additional matters. He did not submit additional matters. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 27, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, ands exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJune 9, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel requested that administrative notice be taken \nof certain factual information pertaining to the country of Iran referenced in 11 \ndocuments. The following is a summary of the facts which administrative notice is taken. \n  \nIran is a theocratic Islamic republic. The United States has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since April 7, 1980. The U.S. Department of State has set forth \nconcerns of the United States with Iran\u2019s policies as: (1) Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear \nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction; (2) Iran\u2019s support for and involvement \nin international terrorism; (3) Iran\u2019s support for violent opposition to the Middle East \npeace process; and (4) Iran\u2019s dismal human rights record. (Admin Not 1, U.S. \nDepartment of State, Background Note: Iran, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, February \n2008, at 8-9.) The United States has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. \n(Admin Not 6, U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Terrorism, Office of the \nCoordinator for Counterterrorism, April 30, 2007, at 2)   \n \nThe Iranian government\u2019s human rights abuses against the Iranian people \ninclude summary executions, lack of fair public trials, disappearances, torture, arbitrary \narrest and detention, political prisoners and detainees, severe restrictions on freedom of \nreligion, discrimination against women, and severe restrictions on civil liberties including \nspeech, press, assembly, association, movement and privacy. (Admin Not 5, U.S. \nDepartment of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 2007, Iran, the \nBureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, March 11, 2008, at 1; Admin Not 4, \nCRS Report for Congress, Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses, updated October \n9, 2007, at 8-13.)  \n \n The U.S. State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens and U.S.\u2013Iranian \ndual citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. Some elements of the \nIranian regime remain hostile to the U.S. and U.S. citizens. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens \nmay be subject to harassment or arrest while residing in Iran. Recently, Iranian \nauthorities have prevented a number of Iranian-American citizen academics, journalists, \nand others who traveled to Iran for personal reasons from leaving, and in some cases \nhave detained and imprisoned them on various charges. Iranian born, naturalized U.S. \ncitizens, and the children of such persons, are considered solely Iranian citizens by \nIranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual citizenship. As a result, U.S.-\nIranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nUnder Iranian law, U.S.-Iranian dual nationals must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian \npassport, unless the Iranian government has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of \nIranian citizenship. (Admin Not 2, U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, \nCountry Specific Information, Iran, June 5, 2007, at 1-2; Admin Not 3, Travel Warning: \nIran, U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs, January 3, 2008.)   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 14, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the \nSOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old engineer employed with a Department of Defense \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since November 2003. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from a U.S. university. He is married and has \nno children. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. (Gov 5.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Iran. He immigrated to the U.S. in September \n1984, at age 18. He became a U.S. citizen on August 26, 1999. (Gov 4; Gov 5) His wife \nis an Iranian citizen and has U.S. permanent resident status. She is eligible to apply for \nU.S. citizenship in 2009. (Answer to SOR.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran who currently resides in \nIran. His father became a U.S. citizen in 2002. He moved back to Iran after he divorced \nhis wife because he had financial problems. He intends to move back to the U.S. when \nhis financial situation improves. Nothing in the record evidence indicates whether \nApplicant\u2019s father is employed in Iran. Applicant speaks with his father by telephone \nabout once or twice a week. His parents-in-law are citizens of and reside in Iran. He has \ncontact with them about once a month.  The record evidence does not indicate what \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law do for a living. (Gov 4 at 3-4.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran, who currently \nreside in the U.S. His brother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran who resides in the \nU.S. His brother has never had an Iranian passport and has never traveled to Iran. \n(Answer to SOR; Gov 5.) \n \nApplicant traveled to Iran on the following dates: March 16, 1998 to April 11, \n1998; November 19, 1999 to November 28, 1999, September 15, 2002 to October 14, \n2002; and August 17, 2003 to September 3, 2003. The purpose of the travel was to find \na wife. He has not traveled to Iran since he brought his wife to the U.S. in 2003. He \ntraveled on his Iranian passport. The Iranian government does not issue entry visas for \nU.S. citizens who were born in Iran.  The only alternative was to use an Iranian passport \nto enter Iran. His Iranian passport expired on April 22, 2007.  He does not intend to \nrenew his Iranian passport.  He owns no property in Iran and has no investments in \nIran.  He is willing to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  He understands that the Iranian \ngovernment would not accept it.  He is also concerned that if the Iranian government \ndiscovers his desire to renounce his Iranian citizenship, they might refuse his father\u2019s \nrequest to leave Iran. (Gov 4 at 3-5; Gov 5, questions 15, 16.)    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n4 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies with respect to  \nApplicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in Iran.  His father and his parents-\nin-law are citizens of and reside in Iran. His father-in-law is also a U.S. citizen but \ncurrently resides in Iran. FI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing that information) applies \nfor the same reason.  Applicant contacts his father by telephone once or twice a week. \nHe has contact with his parents-in-law at least once a month. There is a rebuttable \npresumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his spouse\u2019s \nimmediate family members. (ISCR Case No. 02-03120, February 20, 2002, at 4.)  \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) & 7(d) (sharing living quarter \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies with \nrespect to Applicant\u2019s wife. Her contact with her parents raise the potential to create a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, and brother are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran.  \nThey have lived in the U.S. for a long time.  I find no foreign influence concerns with \nrespect to his mother, sister, and brother.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Influence.  The following Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions \n(FI MC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.) Family contacts and ties with persons in a foreign country \nare not automatically disqualifying but require the applicant to present evidence in \nmitigation and extenuation that he qualifies for a security clearance. Iran\u2019s hostile \nrelationship with the United States and the country\u2019s poor human rights record place \u201ca \nheavy burden of persuasion on applicant to show his family members do not pose a \nsecurity risk. (See, ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug 4, 2006).  Applicant \nhas not met that burden under FI MC \u00b6 8(a). Applicant\u2019s family ties in Iran are significant \nenough to raise foreign influence concerns. The risk is heightened due to the nature of \nthe Iranian government.      \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) does not apply.  In order for FI MC \u00b6 8(b) to apply, Applicant must \nmeet at least one of the elements outlined. The first element is that there is no conflict of \ninterest because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person(s) is \nminimal. This element is not met because Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father in Iran \ncannot be considered minimal. He has contact with him at least once or twice a week. \nHis relationship with his in-laws residing in Iran cannot be considered minimal. He has \ncontact with them at least once a month. The second element of FI MC \u00b6 8(b) is that \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest.  \nApplicant first came to the U.S. in 1984. He attended college in the U.S. He has lived in \nthe U.S. for the past 27 years. His wife, mother, sister and brother reside in the U.S. \nHowever, a potential conflict of interest remains due to Applicant\u2019s family ties in Iran. He \nhas a close relationship with his father. Although he may not be as close to his parents-\nin-law, he has monthly contact with them, and it is reasonable to conclude that his wife \nremains close to her parents.  Although Applicant has longstanding ties to the U.S., \nconcerns remain due to his relatives in Iran. FI MC \u00b6 8(b) cannot be applied.      \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation) is not applicable.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family members who live \nand reside in Iran cannot be considered casual and infrequent.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSecurity concerns remain due to Applicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and \nreside in Iran. Foreign influence concerns are not mitigated. Guideline B is found \nagainst Applicant. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC)10(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport); and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or \nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. Applicant \ntraveled to Iran using his Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen in August 1999, \nduring trips in November 1999, September/October 2002, and August/September 2003. \nHe applied for an extension of his Iranian passport in August 2002.  While Iranian law \nmakes it difficult for U.S./Iranian dual citizens to travel to Iran without the use of an \nIranian passport, Applicant\u2019s possession and use of an Iranian passport after becoming \na U.S. citizen is considered an exercise of his rights of foreign citizenship and raises a \nsecurity concern under foreign preference.   \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Preference. The following Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions \n(FP MC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in \na foreign country) does not apply. While Applicant obtained his dual citizenship based \non his birth in Iran, he exercised his dual citizenship by applying for an extension of his \nIranian passport, and using his Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen in 1999. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies.  Applicant provided proof that his \nIranian passport expired on April 22, 2007. FP MC \u00b6 11(e) applies. He does not intend \nto renew his Iranian passport.   \n \nApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns. Guideline C is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Guideline B is a security concern \nthat affects Applicants through no fault of their own.  The government need not prove an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified information. \nEven good people can pose a security risk because of facts and circumstances not \nunder their control. An applicant with good character and personal integrity can pose a \nsecurity risk because the applicant has close relatives in a country that is hostile to the \nUnited States. (ISCR 01-26893, dated October 16, 2002, at 9-10.)  \n \nThe current nature of the Iranian government and the hostile relationship \nbetween Iran and the U.S. make it a substantial burden to mitigate the concerns raised \nunder foreign influence. Applicant\u2019s significant personal relationships and contacts \nwithin the U.S. do not outweigh the concerns raised by having relatives who are citizens \nand reside in Iran. Foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. Foreign \npreference concerns are mitigated because he no longer possesses a valid Iranian \npassport. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

ROSS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant was engaged in a serious criminal incident in 1991 and a minor one in 1996.\nHe was innocent of the charges brought against him in 2000.  The Applicant\u2019s incorrect answers on\n\n2\ntwo Government questionnaires were not made with the intent to deceive.  Considerable mitigation\nis shown.  Adverse inference is overcome.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 27, 2006, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on November 9, 2006, and a Notice\nof Hearing was issued on January 24, 2007.  The case was assigned to me on February 13, 2007.\nA hearing was held on February 15, 2007, at which the Government presented eight\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted three exhibits.\nThe transcript was received on February 27, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 33, single and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks to obtain a Secret-level DoD security clearance in connection with\nhis employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\nThe Applicant is the product of a broken home.  He was physically abused by his parents\nwhen young and, at the age of 13, their parental rights were terminated and he became a ward of the\nstate.  The Applicant was then in foster care until 18 years of age.  (Government Exhibit 1 at\nquestion 43, Transcript at 65-67, 93-94.)\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 at question 7, Government Exhibit 2 at question 12, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A\n1\nat 1.\n3\nDespite the best efforts of his social worker (Social Worker), who has known him for 20\nyears,  and various foster parents, the Applicant became involved with a gang in the city where he\n1\ngrew up.  On November 9, 1991, he was involved in an incident where one of his fellow gang\nmembers shot another member.  The Applicant had driven the shooter to the location where the other\nperson was shot.  He did not know that the shooter had a weapon until the incident took place.\nThe Applicant was subsequently charged with Attempted Murder.  According to the\nApplicant, the authorities knew that he was not the shooter but wanted the Applicant\u2019s cooperation\nagainst the shooter.  He did cooperate with the authorities.  As a result of his cooperation, the\nAttempted Murder charge was dropped and he plead guilty to Disorderly Conduct, a misdemeanor.\n(Transcript at 26-33.)  \nIn May 1992, the Applicant joined the U.S. Army.  His Army recruiter knew about this\nincident.  In fact, the Applicant had to obtain a waiver in order to enlist.  (Transcript at 33-34.)\nThe Applicant served in the Army for four years.  He was honorably discharged on April 30,\n1996.  On May 13, 1996, as a civilian, the Applicant received a citation from the Military Police at\nhis former duty station.  Along with several friends, the Applicant was involved in removing\nequipment from abandoned automobiles on the base.  Although the car was abandoned, technically\nthe act constituted theft.  The report is somewhat unclear, but it appears that he was charged with\nLarceny of Private Property and Damage to Private Property.  He completed a pre-trial diversion\nprogram, and on September 3, 1996, all charges were dismissed.  (Government Exhibit 5, Transcript\nat 37-43.)\nThe Applicant subsequently enlisted in the Coast Guard in February 1997.  His Coast Guard\nrecruiter knew about this incident.  (Transcript at 43, 81-82.)\nThe Applicant was honorably discharged from the Coast Guard in February 1999, and began\nworking as a civilian.  In August 2000 the Applicant was involved in a fight with the person he was\nsharing a house with.  The Applicant\u2019s credible testimonial evidence is that the other person attacked\nhim with a hammer and the Applicant, a former high school wrestler, defended himself aggressively.\nThe end result was that the other person called the police and the Applicant was arrested as the\naggressor.  Specifically, the other person said that the Applicant had attacked him with a hammer.\n(Transcript at 43-55.)\nThe Applicant was subsequently charged with Assault with Intent to Kill and Assault and\nBattery with a Dangerous Weapon.  He was acquitted of both charges after a jury trial.  (Government\nExhibit 3, Transcript at 56-58.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of his personal\nbackground during the clearance screening process.  The allegation contained in SOR 1.d. will be\nevaluated under this paragraph as well. \n\n4\nOn February 11, 1997, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he\nstated that he had never been charged with a felony offense.  (Government Exhibit 2, questions 23.c.)\nThis statement was a false answer to a material question pertaining to the Applicant's criminal\nhistory. \nThis questionnaire was filled out by the Applicant\u2019s Coast Guard recruiter.  The Applicant\ndid state that he signed it, but he had difficulty remembering the entire transaction.  He stated that\nhe did not believe the information about his 1991 felony charge needed to be disclosed again because\nthe Army had always known of it, and he had just revealed it again in 1995 when he first applied for,\nand was granted, a security clearance by the Army.  (Government Exhibit 2, question 26; Transcript\nat 78-81.)  It is noted that the Applicant listed his Social Worker on this exhibit as a person who\nknows him well, and as the person to contact for a statement of his actions during the time from 1989\nthrough 1992.  He also put down his Army supervisor on the same form.  Both of these people knew\nabout his felony arrest in 1991.  (Government Exhibit 2 at questions 11 and 12, Transcript at 97-98.)\nIn the same questionnaire, he further stated that, in the previous seven years, he had not been\narrested, charged with or convicted of any offense not listed elsewhere on the form.  (Government\nExhibit 2, question 23.f.)  This statement was a false answer to a material question pertaining to the\nApplicant's criminal history.\nRegarding his failure to mention the 1996 incident, the Applicant also had trouble\nremembering the reasoning for his actions ten years ago.  Based on his testimony, it appears that he\nhad a good faith belief that, since the charges had been dismissed, he \u201cdidn\u2019t believe there was a\nneed to disclose that type of information.\u201d  He emphasized the fact that his Coast Guard recruiter\nknew about the 1996 incident.  (Transcript at 82.)\nOn May 17, 2005, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated\nthat he had been charged with a felony offense in 1991 (SOR 1.a.).  He did not reveal his arrest and\nacquittal for Attempted Murder and Assault With Intent to Kill in 2000 (SOR 1.c.).  (Government\nExhibit 1, question 21.)  This statement was a false answer to a material question pertaining to the\nApplicant's criminal history. \nThe Applicant was, and is, tremendously incensed by the injustice of this charge.  He\nexplained his reasons for not putting revealing that incident on his questionnaire:\nI was found not guilty for this - - found not guilty and that\u2019s the reason why -\n- that\u2019s the reason why I had put that down because I - - I\u2019m not guilty.  I didn\u2019t do\nthese charges in the first place.  That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t put those down and felt that I\ndidn\u2019t have to disclose it.  I don\u2019t know any other answer to give you, but that\u2019s my\nanswer.  I honestly didn\u2019t feel there was a need to disclose that because I was found\nnot guilty.  (Transcript at 85-86.)\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant\u2019s acquittal in 2001 acted as a wake up call to him.  He moved to the state\nwhere he now lives and began going to college using his GI education benefits.  He received his\nAssociate of Science degree in 2004 and his Bachelor of Science degree in 2006.  (Applicant\u2019s\n\nThis person was not involved in the 1996 incident (SOR 1.b.).\n2\n5\nExhibit B.)  His grade point average throughout his schooling was 4.0 and he was the Valedictorian\nof his class for both degrees.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  His college advisor stated, \u201cTo say that [the\nApplicant] was an exceptional student is an understatement.  His school ethic and dedication were\nbeyond reproach.  It is rare to see an individual excel to his level.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 3.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s Social Worker, who has known him for 20 years, submitted a letter on his\nbehalf.  She describes him as a \u201cvery kind and compassionate person,\u201d and someone who is \u201chonest\nand often will say nothing if he fears the truth will hurt someone\u2019s feelings.\u201d  She goes on, \u201cThrough\nthe years I have watched this troubled, frightened youth become a smart, confident adult.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 1.)\nA former military colleague of the Applicant also wrote a letter of recommendation for him.\nThis individual continues to serve as a National Guardsman, as well as a Department of Defense\ncivilian.  He firmly recommends the Applicant for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at\n4.)2\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n\n6\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in criminal acts and falsification of Government forms that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has a criminal history (Guideline J); and that he made false material statements to\nDoD, in violation of a felony criminal statute (Guidelines E and J).\n\n7\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The\nApplicant has had to travel a hard road for a good part of his life.  He does not go out of his way to\ndiscuss it, nor does he use it as a shield.  The fact remains that he has successfully turned his life\naround.  This case must be viewed with an acknowledgment of, and an appreciation for, his\nbackground.\nTurning first to the Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct.  He does not contest the incidents in 1991\nand 1996.  His credible testimonial evidence shows a remorse for them, a knowledge of how these\nincidents occurred, and a determination not to have such events occur in the future.  There is little\nto no security significance in his 2000 felony arrest and acquittal.  This is especially so where the\nacquittal was not the result of a plea bargain, but rather a jury\u2019s conclusion based on a trial where\nall the evidence, both for and against the Applicant, was seen and evaluated.  As further discussed\nbelow, I find that he did not intend to deceive the Government when he filled out the two\nquestionnaires at issue.  Accordingly, it has been over ten years since the Applicant has been\ninvolved in any criminal acts which were his fault.\nUnder Guideline J, the following Disqualifying Conditions apply: 31.(a) A single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses; and 31.(c) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  However,\nthe following Mitigating Conditions also apply and, in this case, mandate a finding for the Applicant.\n32.(a) So much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 32.(c) Evidence that the person did not commit the\noffense; and 32.(d) There is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\nAllegations of falsification are serious.  The Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion in\nsuch cases.  Turning to the allegations of falsification of two Government questionnaires, I find that\nthese can also be mitigated.  The Applicant was unsure of the exact course of events in 1997 when\nhe enlisted in the Coast Guard.  What the Applicant was sure of is that he did not intend to deceive\nthe Government by his actions and, based on the particular circumstances of this case, I find this to\nbe true for the following reasons.  First, this was not the first application for a security clearance the\nApplicant had filled out.  The evidence is that he had applied in 1995 for a security clearance in the\nArmy, which was granted.  (Government Exhibit 2 at question 26.)  Second, his credible testimonial\nevidence is that his Army recruiter knew about the1991 felony arrest, and that he had to receive a\nwaiver to enter the Army.  Third, he further testified credibly that his Coast Guard recruiter knew\nabout the 1996 incident, which resulted in pre-trial diversion.  Fourth, he listed his Social Worker\nand former Army supervisor on the 1997 questionnaire as persons who had knowledge of his actions.\nThey certainly would have informed any investigators of the Applicant\u2019s criminal history.  The end\nresult is that the Government had multiple sources of knowledge about the Applicant\u2019s recent and\ndistant past in 1997.  As such, the Applicant did not have an intent to deceive the Government when\nthis questionnaire was filled out incorrectly.\nThe Applicant admits that, in hindsight, he should have listed the 2000 incident, which\nresulted in his acquittal, on the 2005 questionnaire.  The Applicant clearly resents this false charge\nthat he had to fight in court.  The fact that he was acquitted of the charge is important to him.  His\n\n8\nmotivation for not listing that incident, while wrong, was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\nOnce again, I specifically find that the Applicant did not have an intent to deceive the Government\nwhen this form was filled out incorrectly. \nIt is arguable that Disqualifying Condition 16.(a) applies to the facts of this case: Deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.  While none of the Mitigating Conditions apply on their face,\nas discussed in detail above, I do not find that the Applicant intended to deceive the Government and\nfind for him under this Guideline.\nThe Applicant was remarkably candid and open at the hearing concerning his past life, warts\nand all.  His is a remarkable success story, in that he is a young man who has overcome long odds,\nstopped himself from the downhill slide, and is well on the way to achieving success in his life.\nUsing the Whole Person Concept, application of the General Factors is appropriate and supports a\ndecision in the Applicant's favor.  The Applicant\u2019s poor conduct was in the distant past (factor (3));\nhe was young and immature at the time of the events (factor (4)); he shows considerable evidence\nof rehabilitation (factor (6)); there is virtually no potential for pressure, coercion or duress (factor\n(8)); and, under the circumstances of this case, the probability that the Applicant will return to the\npast he has worked so hard to leave is virtually nil (factor (9)). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of\nthe Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 37 years old, divorced from her second husband, with two teenaged children.\nShe works for a defense contractor in the health insurance business.  She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin 1997 after her first marriage ended.  She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2006 two years after her\nsecond marriage ended.  She has delinquent debts of at least $64,990 that she failed to disclose on\nher trustworthiness application, in addition to the filing of her 1997 bankruptcy petition.  She did not\nmitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct trustworthiness concerns.  Eligibility for\nan ADP I/II/III position is denied.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On October 30, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct)of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.  Applicant answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 22, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge.  The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2007.  On April 19, 2007, I convened a hearing\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\ntrustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits\nthat were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to specific SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 37 years old, divorced from her second husband, and the mother of two teenaged\nchildren.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a medical reviewer.  She has been employed\nin that job for over three years.  She divorced her second husband because he molested her children.\nShe filed a criminal complaint against him and he was convicted of the sexual offenses.  He was\nsentenced to two consecutive five-year terms.  He is on probation now and prohibited from having\ncontact with Applicant\u2019s children.  Applicant lives in a separate county from her former husband.\nTheir divorce was final in 2004 and had been pending during the criminal proceedings since June\n2001.  They married in 1998.  She married her first husband in 1989 and divorced him in 1995. (Tr.\n21-24, 27, 35; Exhibits 1 and 2)\nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 1997.  Her debts, totaling an undisclosed\namount, were discharged in bankruptcy in March 1998.  In November 2006, Applicant filed Chapter\n7 bankruptcy again.  She claims all the debts listed in the SOR, totaling $64,990.83, were included\nin the second bankruptcy.  No order of discharge in bankruptcy was submitted into evidence.  A\ncomparison of the debts listed in the SOR and those noted in the 2006 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, shows\nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1.g, 1.h - 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 1.r, 1.u, 1.w, 1.y, 1.bb, 1.dd, 1.ee, 1.gg - 1.jj, got notice of\nthe bankruptcy stay order, or were listed in the Schedule F of the Bankruptcy Petition.  The other\nSOR allegations are not specifically listed in Schedule F.  The 2006 bankruptcy lists 38 debts\ntotaling $78,597.33 in delinquent debts, including secured and unsecured debts.  The SOR tally is\n\n4\n$64,990.83 in delinquent debts.  Of those debts, two are for passing worthless checks to which\ncharges she pled guilty (1.h and 1.k), three are for telephone services, and three are for utility\nservices.  The remaining debts are for credit card purchases and medical services. (Tr. 27, 31, 36,\n61; Exhibits 3-5, B, Answer)\nApplicant earns $856 every two weeks.  From that amount, $261 is taken by court order for\nchild support.  Her children are now living with their father.  They have had drug and disciplinary\nproblems in school.  Applicant\u2019s monthly income is $1,160 and her monthly expenses are $1,300.\nWhen she received child support her monthly income was $2,400 and she could afford her apartment\nand a car while having custody of the children.  She has a budget and sought financial counseling.\nShe will have to lower her expenses by moving to a different apartment to keep within her budget.\nShe does not have credit cards and disavows any intent to obtain any in the future.  While married\nto her second husband their total income was about $120,000, when many of the debts listed in the\nSOR were incurred. (Tr. 32, 42, 45, 49, 57, 58; Exhibits )\nApplicant admitted all the debts listed in the SOR, except the following: 1.b. for a hospital\nbill of $1,874 that was supposed to be in the 1997 bankruptcy; 1.f. for $52 owed to a physician\nApplicant claims she never consulted;1.l. for $337 she does not recall but included it in the 2006\nbankruptcy; 1.ff.  for medical treatment in the amount of $350.92 which was incurred by her\nbrother\u2019s girlfriend pretending to be Applicant and which her brother is paying; and 1.jj. on which\nher wages are being garnished to satisfy the $879 judgment.  Also, Applicant\u2019s name was not on the\nmortgage her second husband had on the house he bought before their marriage, and on which the\nmortgagee foreclosed. (Tr. 36-44; Exhibit A)\nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF-85P) on December 21,\n2004, and re-signed it on March 28, 2005.  On neither form, in answer to Question 22 (Financial\nRecord), did she disclose any legal judgments against her or her 1997 bankruptcy, all of which\noccurred in the previous seven years.  Nor did she disclose on either form that she was more than 180\ndays delinquent on any loan or financial obligation.  She answered \u201cno\u201d to both parts of Question\n22.  She did have an outstanding 1999 judgment for $3,060.94 (SOR subparagraph 1.c), and two\njudgments in 2002, one for $8,063.30 (subparagraph 1.y) and $325.30 (subparagraph 1.cc).\nApplicant claims the debts were her former husband\u2019s obligations that got transferred to her when\nhe filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  She also claims she thought the second form signed in March 2005,\nwas merely to correct her middle initial.  She certified on her SF-85P that her answers were true,\ncomplete, and correct. (Tr. 51; Exhibits 1-5, B)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\n\n5\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\n\n6\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security\nconcern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F: Applicant\u2019s multiple delinquent debts total at least $64,990.  The Chapter 7\nbankruptcy currently pending shows debts of $78,597.33.  These debts go back to 1998, and were\nincurred after Applicant\u2019s first Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997.  The Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\nwhich apply from the Directive are as follows: Applicant\u2019s financial situation shows an inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts (Para. 19.a); indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a\nrealistic plan to pay the debt (Para. 19.b); a history of not meeting financial obligations (Para. 19.c);\ndeceptive or illegal financial practices such as check fraud to which she pled guilty(Para. 19.d); and\nconsistent spending beyond her means which is indicated by excessive indebtedness, with significant\nnegative cash flow and high debt to income ratio (Para. 19.e).  Applicant meets all these criteria\nevidenced by the financial facts alleged and admitted.\nThe molestation of her children by her second husband, their divorce and her moves out of\nstate to protect children may have aggravated some of her financial difficulties.  The magnitude and\nage of her debts, without supporting documentation or other evidence to show the debts were\nactually her former husband\u2019s debts, are her responsibility.  Applicant, after her first divorce, filed\nbankruptcy.  Now, after her second divorce, she files bankruptcy again, substantiating that these\nfinancial difficulties were not beyond her control.  While filing bankruptcy may be construed to be\na good-faith effort to resolve debts, Applicant has not shown that she is discharged in bankruptcy.\nShe appears to have filed the petition after the SOR was issued as a expedient way in which to\nmanage her finances by riding herself of substantial debt she voluntarily incurred.  Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent financial situation ,in which her expenses exceed her income demonstrate her problems\ncontinue and she may be in further financial difficulty in the future.  Based on all these facts, I\nconclude no Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply.\n \n\n7\nGuideline E: Applicant did not disclose on her SF-85P any financial difficulties in the past\nseven years.  Her 1997 Chapter 7 bankruptcy was within the seven year period required for\ndisclosure, but Applicant revealed nothing about it.  I do not believe her explanation why she failed\nto disclose them.  She repeated the financial problems she experienced in her first marriage in her\nsecond marriage.  The DC which applies is Para. 16.(a) involving deliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, or\ndetermine trustworthiness.\nGiven two opportunities to provide complete information on the Sf-85P, in 2004 and again\nin 2005, Applicant did not provide a true picture for the Government of her financial situation.  I\nconclude her explanation is not credible or persuasive. \nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination\u201d that the person is eligible for a trustworthiness decision. Directive\nE2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case,\nI have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  The magnitude\nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, the repeated pattern of them, and the subsequent bankruptcies, are\nserious actions.  She was an adult when she incurred the debts, and had full knowledge of what she\nwas doing.  Even with the molestation of her children as a factor, her lack of attention to her\nfinancial situation is of serious concern.  Her current income and expenses show there is a substantial\nlikelihood of repetition of this type of spending.  There is no evidence of  rehabilitation or significant\nchanges in her financial management demonstrating that similar problems will not recur in the\nfuture, given that they have occurred twice in her life.  The burden of proof is on Applicant to show\nthe MCs should apply to her.  She failed in that burden.  She has not established a track record of\nfinancial responsibility to assure the Government that similar problems will not recur in the future.\nTherefore, I conclude the financial considerations trustworthiness concern against Applicant.\nI also conclude the personal conduct trustworthiness concern against Applicant.  Lastly, the \u201cwhole\nperson concept\u201d I conclude against Applicant based on her history of over-spending and financial\nmismanagement.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nHer application for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\nPhilip S.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August16, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline C is not at issue in this appeal. \n1\nSee Directive \u00b6  E2.A2.2.1.  \u201cA security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family, including\n2\ncohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens\nof the United States or may be subject to duress.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 03-26176 at 5 (App. Bd.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 16, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mark W.

Applicant provides citations\nto other DOHA cases, to include cases by Hearing Office Judges, which he believes support his\nappeal.   Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant is a senior engineer for\na defense contractor.  His father, mother, two sisters, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens\nof Iran and either live in or visit Iran.  His parents are elderly, living in Iran about half the year and\nin the U.S. the other half.  Applicant provides some financial support for his parents.

In his analysis, the Judge noted record evidence favorable to\nApplicant, such as the high quality of his job performance, his financial and personal ties to the U.S.,\nand the fact that his Iranian relatives do not live in such a fashion as to draw the attention of their\ngovernment.  \nHe also noted, however, the number of Applicant\u2019s close family members who are citizens\nof Iran,  the fact that his contact with them is neither casual nor infrequent,  and the brutal nature of\n2\n3\n\n3\nthe Iranian regime.  He concluded that \u201cthere is a significant possibility\u201d that the Iranian government\ncould subject him to \u201cpressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d by means of those relatives.\nTherefore, he denied Applicant a clearance.

Since leaving active duty with the U.S. Navy in 1984, he has\nworked for a federal contractor. When he completed a security clearance application in 1993, he\ndisclosed three arrests, two of which related to the use of alcohol.

He mitigated the security concerns raised under the alcohol\nconsumption, criminal and personal conduct guidelines. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended, and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program  (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed\nreasons under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct)\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant. DOHA recommended\nthe case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted.\nOn October 17, 2006, Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR, but was subsequently notified\nthat it was insufficient to comply with the requirements under the Directive. On December 22, 2006,\nhe filed another Answer and elected to have a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 26,\n2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 8, 2007, setting the hearing for February 28, 2007.\nAt the hearing, the Government introduced Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 into evidence without objections.\nApplicant and his wife testified. The record was left open until March 16, 2007, to give Applicant an\nopportunity to submit documentary evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March\n12, 2007. No additional documents were submitted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 45 years old. He recently married his girlfriend of 22 years, who has lived with\nhim for many years. From June 1980 to June 1984, he was on active duty in the U. S. Navy. After\nleaving active duty, he went on inactive duty until January 1991, when he received an honorable\ndischarge. He was a 3  class petty officer at the time of the discharge (GX 2 at 2). Since June 1984,\nrd\nhe has worked as an electrician for a federal contractor where he is also a make-up supervisor (Tr.\n23). He has held a secret security clearance since August 1985 (GX 1 at 6).\nApplicant completed a National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) in August 1993 (GX 2). In it,\nhe disclosed that he was arrested in 1990, 1992 and 1993. In November 1990, he was arrested and\ncharged with Driving While Intoxicated (DUI) and Reckless Driving. Both charges were not\nprosecuted. In October 1992, he was arrested and charged with Operating a Motor Vehicle While\n\nParagraph 1.c of the SOR lists the date of the arrest as August 23, 1992.\n1\nParagraph 2.a of the SOR lists the date of the arrest as November 13, 1992.\n2\n3\nUnder the Influence of Alcohol. The matter was not prosecuted.  In March 1993, he was arrested and\n1\ncharged with Felony Destruction of Private Property. He made restitution and the charges were\ndismissed.  Applicant\u2019s wife helped him complete the NAQ.\n2\nWhen Applicant completed the January 2004 SCA, Applicant did not disclose the 1992 felony\narrest for the destruction of property under Question 21: Your Police Record-Felony Offenses, or the\n1990 and 1992 alcohol related arrests under Question 24. Your Police Record-Alcohol/Drug Offenses.\nHe admitted that he did not list those arrests, but denied that he deliberately attempted to deceive the\nGovernment (Tr. 24, 25). At the time, his wife was very sick and unable to help him fill out the form\n(Tr. 16, 20). He was confused by the questions and did not think he was required to disclose the three\ncharges because they were dismissed and not convictions (Tr. 19). His explanation was credible.\nIn September 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with another DUI after attending his\nsister-in-law\u2019s wedding (Tr. 27). He was given a breathalyzer test and his blood alcohol level was .11\n(Tr. 28). He pled guilty, was fined $250, and placed on a year\u2019s probation. His driver\u2019s license was\nsuspended for one year and he was required to attend driving school. The court also ordered him to\nparticipate in an alcohol safety program. He attended eight weeks of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings\nand stopped consuming alcohol for a year (Tr. 35-36). His wife attended a meeting with him (Tr.56).\nHe has not participated in any rehabilitative program since that time.\nAfter approximately a year of alcohol abstinence and completing the program, Applicant\nresumed consuming alcohol when he became distressed over his wife\u2019s illness (Tr. 38). He drank\noccasionally at home from that point to about six months ago when he stopped as his wife\u2019s medical\ncondition worsened (Tr. 38). He realized that drinking caused him many problems and that he was\nthe sole provider for the family (Tr. 24, 30). When he met with a government investigator in March\n2006, he told her that he drank \u201cabout a fifth of liquor over a week\u2019s time in the last five years.\u201d (Tr.\n29) However, that time period was before the September 2004 conviction (Tr. 31, 38). He denied that\nhe consistently consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication from 1986 until March 2006 (Tr. 25).\nCurrently, Applicant manages stress through physical training at his home gym several days\na week with a new set of friends (Tr 38). He no longer exercises with the friends with whom he\npreviously drank (Tr. 51). \nApplicant\u2019s wife generally handles all of the paperwork in the family. She helped her husband\ncomplete the NAQ in 1993, but was unable to assist him in January 2004 because of her illness (Tr.\n47). She understands how he became confused by the wording of the questions on the SCA (Tr. 48).\nShe confirmed that he stopped drinking about six months ago, changed friends, exercises regularly,\nand has taken more responsibility around the house, as she is unable to work (Tr. 51-57). She believes\nhe has matured since her illness (Tr. 58).\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n3\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n4\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\n6\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n7\nId.\n8\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information, sets forth criteria that must be evaluated when determining security\nclearance eligibility. Within those adjudicative guidelines are factors to consider in denying or\nrevoking an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and\nfactors to consider in granting an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Mitigating\nConditions). By recognizing that individual circumstances of each case are different, the guidelines\nprovide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to\nreach a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high degree\nof trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must include\nconsideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also consideration\nof any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise classified information.\nAny doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n3\nclearance is not necessarily a judgment about an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that\n4\nan applicant has not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing\na clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a rational connection between\n5\npast proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.6\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\ncorresponding burden of rebuttal shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\n7\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nclearance.\u201d  \n8\n\n5\nBased upon the allegations contained in the SOR and a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole, the following adjudicative guidelines are pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption: A security concern arises because excessive alcohol\nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control\nimpulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to\ncarelessness.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: A security concern arises when a history or pattern of\ncriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could\nindicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information, and raises a security\nconcern.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility and the application\nof the appropriate legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth\nin the SOR:\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nBased on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government established a\ndisqualification under Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1 (Alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting child or spouse\nabuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use). Applicant admitted he was arrested and\ncharged with criminal conduct in 1990, 1992 and 2004 for incidents involving the misuse of alcohol.\nThe Government having raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations. After reviewing the mitigating conditions under this guideline, in particular\nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.3 (Positive changes in behavior\nsupportive of sobriety), I concluded it applies. In addition to being remorseful about his past behavior,\nApplicant expressed an appreciation of the consequences associated with the abuse of alcohol and the\ncriminal justice system. He appears to be committed to his wife and accepts sole responsibility for\nsupporting the family in view of her medical problems. That evidence, along with his wife\u2019s\ntestimony of a noticeable change in him over the past six months, and a change in friends, comprises\nsufficient mitigation under this condition.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\n\n6\nBased on the evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions regarding the four criminal charges, the\nGovernment established a disqualification under Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC)\nE2. A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), as\nto \u00b6\u00b6 2. a and 2.b. \nIn refutation of those allegations, Applicant provided evidence to establish some mitigation\nunder Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was\nnot recent), and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation). Three\nof the charges are more than ten years old and either were dismissed or not prosecuted. As to the 2004\nconviction, Applicant successfully completed all court ordered terms and has not been involved in\nany subsequent incidents for more than two years. In addition to these facts and those stated above,\nhe has satisfactorily performed his job over the last ten years and has been a supervisor for two years,\nwhich constitutes evidence of successful rehabilitation.\nBased on the conclusion, stated below, that Applicant did not deliberately falsify his SCA, as\nrequired under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 2.c are concluded in his favor.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleged in Paragraph 3 that Applicant intentionally falsified his SCA by\nfailing to disclose the 1990 and 1992 arrests, which operates as a disqualification under Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E 2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status determines security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities). Although Applicant admitted that he failed to disclose the\ninformation, he denied that he did intentionally.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17,\n2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant credibly explained that he failed to disclose the three arrests because he was\nconfused by the questions and did not think he was required to list them because he was not convicted\nof the charges. He now realizes that he made a mistake. Regrettably, he did not have his wife to help\nhim interpret the questions as she had done when he completed the 1993 application and made full\ndisclosure. The Government conceded that his explanation was plausible and I conclude similarly.\nHence, the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b are found in his favor. \nWhole Person Analysis\n\n7\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, the\nadjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information\nabout the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.2. describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conduct an administrative\njudge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered Applicant\u2019s middle age, his fourteen years of military service, the length of time\nhe has worked for his current employer and his current supervisory role, as well as the fact that he has\nheld a security clearance since 1985 without any problems. I took into account his testimony about\nthe alcohol charges and his present concern about his wife\u2019s health. Although it may be prudent for\nhim to participate in an ongoing rehabilitation program as an additional method of managing stress,\nI do not believe similar criminal problems will recur in the future, given his awareness of the security\nclearance process and the impact additional incidents would have on his employment. Applicant\nmitigated those security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. Those\nconcerns raised under personal conduct are found in his favor. Accordingly, Guidelines G, J and E\nare concluded for him.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, who has a history of criminal behavior, falsified his answers to Questions 16 and\n\nSee Memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security, dated\n1\nNovember 19, 2004, Subject: Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (directing DOHA to utilize Defense Department\nDirective 5220.6 to resolve contractor cases forwarded to it for a trustworthiness determination, to include those cases\ninvolving ADP I, II, and III positions).\nSee Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005).\n2\n20 on his Public Trust Position Application (SF-85P) by failing to acknowledge and list his past\ncriminal offenses and a debt of approximately $5,271 that was over 180 days delinquent.  He failed\nto mitigate security concerns under Guidelines E and J.  Eligibility is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nIn May 2003, Applicant executed and signed an application for a position of public trust (SF-\n85P).  In September 2004, he executed and signed a second SF-85P application.  The Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) reviewed Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an automated data\nprocessing (ADP) position designated as an ADP I, II, or III position to support a contract with the\nDefense Department.  As a result of the review, the agency recommended Applicant\u2019s case be\nsubmitted to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant is eligible to occupy such a\nposition.\nActing under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on September 26, 2006.  \n1\nThe SOR details the factual basis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guidelines J and\nE of the Directive.\nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (revised adjudicative guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005.  The revised adjudicative guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department and promulgated, effective September 1, 2006.  They supercede\nor replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD\nRegulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other determinations where a SOR has\nbeen issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.    The revised adjudicative guidelines apply to this\n2\ncase because the SOR is dated September 26, 2006, and this is an ADP I, II, III  trustworthiness\ndetermination. A copy of the revised adjudicative guidelines was provided to Applicant along with\nthe SOR.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 17, 2006, and requested that his case be\ndetermined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on January 8, 2007.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1\nthrough 6.  By letter dated January 10, 2007, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with\ninstructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.\n\nGuideline J DC E2.A10.1.2.1 reads: \u201cAllegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\n3\nperson was formally charged.\u201d  Guideline J  DC E2.A10.1.2.2. reads: \u201cA single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d Guideline E DC E2.A5.1.2.2. reads: \u201cThe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility\nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nThe applicable DCs under the revised Guideline J adjudicative guideline are found at \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). The\n4\napplicable DC under revised adjudicative Guideline E is found at \u00b6 16(a).  Revised Guideline J \u00b631(a) reads as follows:\n\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d  Revised Guideline J \u00b6 31(c)   reads as follows: \u201callegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted.\u201d  Revised Guideline E \u00b6 16(a) reads as follows: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility\nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\n3\nApplicant received the file on January 17, 2007.  Applicant did not file any information within the\nrequired time period. On May 2, 2007, the case was assigned to me for a decision.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\n1.  The Government moved to amend SOR subparagraph 2.a. to delete the reference to\nsubparagraph 1.e.  In support of its motion, the Government noted that the incident referred to in\nsubparagraph 1.e. post-dates Applicant\u2019s execution of the SF-85P alleged in the paragraph and\ntherefore could not be the source of a falsification allegation. Applicant was given notice of the\nGovernment\u2019s motion to amend and did not object.  Accordingly, for good cause shown, the\nGovernment\u2019s motion to amend the SOR is granted.\n2. The Government\u2019s argument in the FORM incorrectly references Guideline J Disqualifying\nCondition (DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. and  DC E2.A10.1.2.2 and Guideline E DC E2.A5.1.2.2 . These\n3\ndisqualifying conditions were superceded by Guideline J and Guideline E revised adjudicative\nguidelines, effective September 1, 2006, which apply to this case because the SOR was issued\nSeptember 26, 2006.   The record reflects that Applicant was given a copy of the applicable revised\n4\nadjudicative guidelines and informed that they, and not the superceded guidelines, applied in his\ncase. He raised no objections or questions.  The wording and plain meaning of the relevant\nprovisions of the old and revised adjudicative guidelines are essentially the same.  Accordingly, I\nfind the Government\u2019s citations to the old adjudicative guidelines in the Argument section of the\nFORM arose from clerical mistake or oversight and caused Applicant no prejudice or harm.\nThroughout this decision, revised adjudicative guidelines J and E, effective in all trustworthiness\nadjudications in which a SOR was issued September 1, 2006, and thereafter, will be cited and\napplied.   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe amended SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct, and four allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal\n\n4\nConduct. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR. (Item 3.)  His admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact.\nApplicant is 40 years old, unmarried, and employed by a Defense contractor as a Claims\nAnalyst III.  He attended college for one year.  (Item 4.)\nThe Government alleged and Applicant admitted that on or about May 31, 1992, he was\narrested and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence (DUI), (2) DUI with a blood alcohol\ncontent of .10, (3) Speed Not Prudent to Avoid a Collision, and (4) No Proof of Insurance.\nApplicant admitted he pled guilty to Counts (1) and (4) and that Counts (2) and (3) were dismissed.\nThe Government alleged Applicant was sentenced to 3 years probation, one day of jail time, and\nrestitution of $2,237.29, ordered to complete a substance abuse screening program, but failed to\ncomply. The Government further alleged that a probation revocation hearing was scheduled for May\n31, 1993; that on May 31, 1994, a warrant was issued; that on July 30, 2003, the warrant was\nquashed, and Applicant was reordered to a substance abuse program. The Government further\nalleged Applicant failed to comply with the order; that a probation revocation hearing was set for\nOctober 23, 2003; that Applicant failed to appear for the hearing, a warrant was issued, and as of\nJanuary 2005, the warrant was still active.  (Item 1; Amended SOR \u00b6 1.a..) \nApplicant admitted he failed to comply with the order to complete a substance abuse\nprogram.  He neither admitted nor denied the Government\u2019s allegation that he was sentenced to 3\nyears probation, one day of jail time, and restitution of $2,237.29.  He neither admitted nor denied\nknowledge of the probation revocation hearing scheduled for May 31, 1993, that a  warrant was\nissued on May 31, 1994, that the warrant was quashed on July 31, 2003, and that he was again\nordered to a substance abuse program.  He denied knowledge of a probation revocation hearing set\nfor October 23, 2003, and admitted he failed to appear at the hearing.  He denied knowledge that a\nwarrant issued pursuant to his failure to appear was still active as of January 2005. (Item 3.)  The\nGovernment produced no evidence to support the SOR allegations that Applicant denied, nor did it\nproduce evidence to support the allegations that he neither admitted nor denied.  \nThe Government alleged, and Applicant admitted, that on or about June 21, 1993, he was\ncited for Indecent Exposure of the Genitals and that he pled No Contest to an amended charge of\nDisturbing the Peace.  The Government further alleged Applicant was sentenced to one year\nprobation and ordered to complete a substance abuse program.  Applicant admitted he failed to\ncomply with the sentence to complete a substance abuse program.  He denied knowledge of a\nprobation revocation hearing set for June 15, 1994, and acknowledged he failed to appear. The\nGovernment alleged, and Applicant neither admitted nor denied, that a warrant was subsequently\nissued on June 15, 1994.   The Government alleged that, as of January 2005, the case was still open.\nApplicant denied knowledge that the case was still open as of January 2005.  (Item 1; Amended SOR\n\u00b6 1.b.; Item 3.)  The Government produced no evidence to support the SOR allegations that\nApplicant denied, nor did it produce evidence to support the allegations that he neither admitted nor\ndenied.\nThe Government alleged, and Applicant admitted, that on about June 16, 1996, he was\narrested and charged with (1) DUI with a Prior and (2) DUI with a blood alcohol content of .10 or\nhigher. (Item 1; Amended SOR \u00b6 1.c.; Item 3.)\n\n5\nThe Government alleged, and Applicant admitted, that on about June 21, 1998, he was\narrested and charged with Failure to Appear/DUI,  posted bond, and was released. (Item 1; Amended\nSOR \u00b6 1.d.; Item 3.)\nThe Government alleged that on about July 6, 2003, Applicant was cited for (1) No Current\nRegistration and (2) No Valid Driver\u2019s License and was fined $635.  The Government further alleged\nthat, as of February 8, 2005, the case was still open and Applicant owed $601.24.  (Item 1; Amended\nSOR \u00b6 1.e.)  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the citations for No Current Registration\nand No Valid Driver\u2019s License.  He stated the charges arose when he drove an intoxicated friend\nhome in the friend\u2019s vehicle, and the friend did not have his vehicle registration in his car. Applicant\nadmitted he appeared before a judge.  He asserted he paid a fine for the citation of No Valid Driver\u2019s\nLicense and provided the court with a copy of his friend\u2019s vehicle registration.  (Item 3.) Applicant\nprovided no evidence to support his assertion that he paid a fine or supplied his friend\u2019s vehicle\nregistration to the court.  He denied awareness he still owed a fine or that the case was still open as\nof February 8, 2005. (Item 3.)  The Government produced no evidence to support the SOR\nallegations that Applicant denied.  \nApplicant completed and certified a SF-85P on May 23, 2003.  Question 16 on the SF-85P\nreads as follows: \u201c16. Your Police Record In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged\nwith, or convicted of any offense(s)? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.)\u201d Applicant\nresponded \u201cno\u201d to Question 16 and deliberately failed to list the information set forth in\nsubparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d. of the amended SOR.  (Item 1; Amended SOR \u00b6 2.a.; Item 3.) )\nOn September 8, 2004, Applicant executed and certified a second SF-85P.  He again\nresponded \u201cno\u201d to Question 16 and  failed to list the citation and fine he received on about July 6,\n2003, as alleged in \u00b6 1.e. of the SOR  Applicant asserted his omission was \u201cunknowing.\u201d(Item 1,\nAmended SOR \u00b6 2.b.; Item 3.)  \nOn the SF-85P executed by Applicant on September 8, 2004, there appeared a Question 20,\nwhich read as follows: \u201c20. Your Financial Record - 180-Day Delinquencies Are you now over\n180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or\nguaranteed by the Federal Government.)\u201d Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 20  failed to list a\ndebt to the U.S. Department of Education for a student loan of approximately $5,271.  Applicant\ncharacterized his omission as a mistake. (Item 1, Amended SOR \u00b6  2.c.; Item 3.) \nThe Government alleged that Applicant\u2019s July 6, 2003, citation and subsequent fine for No\nCurrent Registration and No Valid Driver\u2019s License, demonstrated disqualifying conduct under\nGuideline E. (Amended SOR \u00b6 2.d.)  Applicant admitted the citations and the levy of a fine by the\ncourt.  He asserted he had paid the fine and denied still owing money on the fine.  He also denied\nknowing the case was still open, and he asserted he had mailed the court a copy of his friend\u2019s\nvehicle registration to rebut the citation for No Current Registration. (Item 3.)  He provided no\nevidence to corroborate his statements that he had paid the fine and provided the court with a copy\nof his friend\u2019s vehicle registration.    \nAfter executing his SF-85P applications in May 2003 and September 2004, Applicant signed\nand dated the following certification:\n\nThese guidelines were amended and promulgated, effective September 1, 2006. \n5\n6\nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are\nmade in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful false\nstatement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or\nboth (See section 1001 of title 18, United States Code.)  (Item 4.)\nPOLICIES\nThe ADP adjudication process extends only to sensitive positions.  Positions designated as\nADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions; ADP III positions are not.  Regulation \u00b6 AP\n10.2.  By memorandum dated November 19, 2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security directed DOHA to extend the adjudicative process to ADP III\npositions as well.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  Regulation\n\u00b6 C6.1.1.1.  Appendix B of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.   DoD\n5\ncontractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.  Regulation\n\u00b6 C8.2.1.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Government\u2019s concern under the Criminal Conduct revised adjudicative guideline  is that\na history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  Two conditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses and DC 31(c):\nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted.\nApplicant admitted criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d.  He also\nadmitted two lesser offenses, traffic violations, alleged at \u00b6 1.e. of the SOR, for which he was fined\n$635.  While Applicant admitted allegation 1.e., his admission is not enough to establish criminal\nmisconduct under Guideline J.  He admitted he twice failed to comply with a sentence to complete\na substance abuse screening program.  (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.)  He denied knowledge of and failing to\nappear for probation revocation hearings in 1994 and 2003, and he denied knowledge of warrants\nissued in May and June 1994 and October 2003 ordering him into a substance abuse screening\nprogram. \nApplicant denied knowing he had been cited for failing to comply with the terms of his\nprobation, and the Government provided no evidence to support a conclusion that Applicant had\n\n7\nreceived notice of a probation revocation hearing in 1993 and a probation revocation hearing in\n1994. Applicant also denied knowledge that his failure to appear for a probation revocation hearing\nresulted in a warrant which was still active as of January 2005.  Applicant denied he still owed a fine\nfor two 2003 citations (No Current Registration and No Valid Driver\u2019s License), but he failed to\nprovide evidence to corroborate his denial.  I conclude that the Government failed to prove Applicant\nknew about his probation revocation hearings and their consequences.  However, Applicant\u2019s\nmultiple criminal offenses and his admissions of criminal conduct raise concerns under revised\nadjudicative Guideline J, \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).\nOnly two mitigating conditions under Guideline J might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s\ncase.  Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under Mitigating Condition (MC)\n32(a) if he provided credible evidence to show that so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Applicant\u2019s\nadmitted criminal activity spans a period of six years, from 1992 to 1998.  He provided no credible\nevidence to substantiate a conclusion that he has complied with court orders to participate in a\nsubstance abuse screening program.  His failure to comply with the court orders casts doubt on his\nreliability, trustworthiness, and reliability and his ability to follow laws, rules and regulations.\nAccordingly, I conclude MC 32(a) is inapplicable.  \nApplicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under MC 32(d) if he provided\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.  Applicant failed to show that\nsufficient time had passed to reasonably conclude his criminal activity had ceased and would not be\nrepeated in the future. I conclude he failed to provide evidence of successful rehabilitation.\nAccordingly, MC 32(d) does not apply. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. Guideline E, \u00b6 15.   \nUnder Guideline E, a security concern is raised by an individual\u2019s deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities. Guideline E, \u00b6 16(a). \nApplicant executed and signed public trust position applications in May 2003 and September\n2004.  After responding \u201cno\u201d to Question 16 on the SF-85P he executed in May 2003, Applicant\nfailed to list his arrest in about June 1996 for DUI with a Prior and DUI with a blood alcohol content\nof .10 or higher.  He also failed to list his arrest in June 1998 and charge of Failure for Appear/DUI,\nfor which he posted bond and was released.  After responding \u201cno\u201dto Question 16 on the SF-85P he\nexecuted in September 2004, Applicant failed to list his citation in July 2003 for (1) No Current\n\n8\nRegistration and (2) No Valid Driver\u2019s License.  After responding \u201cno\u201d to Question 20 on the SF-\n85P he executed in September 2004, Applicant also failed to list and identify an education debt of\n$5,271, which was more than 180 days delinquent.\nApplicant admitted he deliberately falsified his answer to Question 16 on the SF-85P he\nexecuted and signed in May 2003.  He characterized his falsification of his answer to question 16\non the SF-85P he executed in September 2004 as \u201cunknowing\u201dand provided no further explanation.\nHe characterized his falsification of his answer to Question 20 on the SF-85P he executed in\nSeptember 2004 as \u201cmistaken\u201d and provided no further explanation. \nThe Government established a prima facie case that Applicant falsified his answers to\nQuestions 16 and 20 on his September 2004 SF-85P.  The burden of proof thus shifted to Applicant\nto rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s allegations.  Applicant denied he deliberately falsified his\nanswers to the questions, but he provided no credible evidence in support of his denials.  \nOne Guideline E mitigating condition (MC) might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s conduct.\nPursuant to MC 17(a),  personal conduct security concerns might be mitigated if the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts. \nApplicant provided no credible evidence to mitigate his failure to list his arrests for criminal\nconduct in June 1996 and June 1998 and his citations in 2003.  Additionally, he provided no credible\nevidence for his failure to list his education debt that was over 180 days delinquent.  At the time he\ncompleted his SF-85P applications, Applicant was a mature adult and a high school graduate.\nAlthough he knew, or should have known, the importance of telling the truth to the Government, he\nhad reason to attempt to minimize his knowledge of his criminal conduct and his delinquent\neducation debt.  His denials that his falsifications were deliberate were not credible. He did not make\ngood-faith efforts to correct his omissions, concealment, or falsifications before being confronted\nwith the facts.  I conclude that MC 17(a) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nAdditionally, DOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s 2003 citations for (1) No Current Registration\nand (2) No Valid Driver\u2019s License, alleged under the Criminal Conduct guideline, also raised\nGuideline E security concerns. (See SOR \u00b6 1.e.)  A security concern under Guideline E is raised by\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations.  Such conduct can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  Guideline E, \u00b6 15. \nApplicant, who was not in possession of a valid driver\u2019s license, drove another person\u2019s\nvehicle, which had no current registration.  Applicant\u2019s admitted conduct demonstrated a disregard\nfor established rules and regulations related to the safe use of automobiles. While he asserted he\nbroke traffic safety rules to help an intoxicated friend, Applicant supplied no evidence to support his\nassertion.  I conclude Applicant\u2019s conduct raises a security concern under Guideline E, \u00b6 15, about\nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\nOne mitigating condition under Guideline E might apply to these facts.  Applicant\u2019s conduct\nmight be mitigated if the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\n\n9\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Guideline E, MC\n17(c).\nWhen viewed in light of Applicant\u2019s several other admitted criminal offenses, Applicant\u2019s\ncitations for (1) No Current Registration and (2) No Valid Driver\u2019s License are less serious.\nHowever, the conduct, which occurred in the recent past, reveals an unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations and is supported by Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct dating from 1992.\nApplicant supplied no credible evidence to support a conclusion that his rule-breaking conduct is\nunlikely to recur.  Accordingly, MC 17(c) is inapplicable. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nan administrative judge must thoroughly consider and review of all available reliable information\nabout the appellant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.\nDoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, describes this process of scrutiny and evaluation as \u201cthe\nwhole person concept.\u201d  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish a pattern of criminal conduct and\nfalsification that casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct spans a period of 12 years, and he offered no evidence of rehabilitation,\ncasting doubt on his trustworthiness.  Finally, Applicant deliberately misled the Government\nregarding his criminal conduct and his financial delinquencies.  These actions cast serious doubts\non his trustworthiness.\nIn ICR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec. 27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states that an\nadministrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust consider the record as\na whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\u201d  I have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated\nApplicant\u2019s conduct under the whole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that Applicant has\nnot mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by the allegations in the SOR, and he has not\ndemonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for an ADP\nI, II, or III position.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SO:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.: Guideline E.: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I, II, or\nIII position.

This action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1992, as amended. Applicant answered the SOR on January 16, 2007, admitting the allegations and\nrequesting a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 12, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March\n28, 2007, scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for April 18, 2007. During the hearing, I received six\ngovernment exhibits, two Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the Applicant\u2019s request,\nI left the record open through May 4, 2007 to allow him to submit additional exhibits. On May 3,\n2007, he submitted nine additional exhibits which I marked and received as Exhibits C through K.\nDOHA received the transcript on May 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old married man with five adult children. He is a U.S. Army veteran,\nserving from 1976 through his retirement in 1996. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in theology in\n1981, and is working toward another bachelor\u2019s degree in systems administration.  Currently, he\n1\nworks as a systems administrator.\nApplicant is highly respected at work and in his community. A coworker characterized him\nas reliable and hardworking.  The senior pastor at the church where he serves as an associate pastor\n2\ndescribed him as a man of \u201chigh morale [sic] standards.\u201d  \n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when he retired from the military in 1996. At that time,\nhe experienced trouble finding a well-paying job. His job situation stabilized in 1999 when he first\nbegan working as a systems administrator.

By early 2006, his monthly after-expense\nincome increased to approximately $1,500.5\nNevertheless, by that time, Applicant had accrued approximately $20,500 of delinquent debt.\nHe owes approximately $12,500 of this delinquent debt to a car dealer, as listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a, who had financed the purchase of a car Applicant owned at the time. At some time\nin 2005, Applicant took the car to a shop to get it repaired. The estimated repair costs were double\nwhat he could afford, and were more than he owed the creditor at the time.   Subsequently, he neither\n6\nfixed it, nor continued to make monthly car payments.\nApproximately five months later, the dealer repossessed the car and resold it.  The amount\n7\ndue represents the difference between Applicant\u2019s purchase price and the resale amount. Applicant\ntalked to the creditor a few times in 2006 in an attempt to reduce the amount of the delinquency. He\nwas unsuccessful. He intends to make payments toward its satisfaction by the end of 2007 after he\nhas satisfied the other delinquencies.  Recently, Applicant financed the purchase of a 2007-model\n8\ncar for $27,000. He pays $631 per month toward the satisfaction of the car note.\nSOR subparagraph 1.b is a delinquency Applicant owes a phone company for $279. He\nnegotiated a payoff in the amount of $139, and paid it in May 2007.9\nSubparagraph 1.c is a delinquency originating from a loan Applicant executed when he was\nin the military. During that time, payments were automatically deducted from his paycheck. This\nstopped after he retired, and he subsequently fell behind. By January 2002, he owed approximately\n$2,579. In April 2007, he successfully negotiated a settlement in the amount of $1,000, and satisfied\nit shortly thereafter.10\nOver the past year, Applicant has intermittently discussed resolving the remaining SOR\ndelinquencies with the respective creditors, but has been unable to structure any repayment\narrangements. He projects that he will complete the delinquency settlement process and satisfy them\nby the end of 2007. In October 2006, in response to interrogatories propounded by the government,\nApplicant stated that he planned on resolving all of his debts \u201cin the near future.\u201d11\nPOLICIES\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n12\n4\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n12\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant has struggled to manage his finances for more than ten years. By November 2006,\nhe had accrued approximately $20,500 of delinquent debt. Financial Considerations Disqualifying\n\nExhibit 3, Signed, Sworn Statement, dated May 2, 2002 at 5.\n13\n5\nCondition (FC DC) 19(a): Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, FC DC 19(c): a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which\nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income\nratio, and/or other financial analysis, apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 1996, and the majority of his delinquencies are still\nunpaid. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(a): the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, does\nnot apply.\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to a lapse in income he experienced shortly after\nleaving the military in 1996, and he attributes his inability to make more significant progress toward\ntheir satisfaction to his preoccupation with legal issues that arose following his father\u2019s death in late\n2005. As of May 2002, Applicant had approximately $800 of monthly income remaining after\nexpenses.  By February 2006, his monthly after-expense income had increased to $1,500. Later that\n13\nyear, he financed the purchase of a $27,000 automobile. His lingering financial problems stem more\nfrom problems with money management rather than cash flow problems or unanticipated family\nissues. FC MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does\nnot apply.\nApplicant received counseling in mid-2006. Also, he satisfied two of the SOR delinquencies,\nand has been negotiating with creditors to satisfy the remainder. FC MC 20(c): the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem, and FC MC 20(d): the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant is a conscientious employee who served the country as a member of the Army for\n20 years, and currently serves his community as an associate pastor at a neighborhood church. He\nhas had, however, lingering problems managing his finances. Although Applicant promised to begin\nsatisfying his delinquencies in October 2006, he did not begin until April 2007, approximately a\nweek after the hearing. His improved financial circumstances enhance the likelihood that he will be\nable to pay the remaining debts. This positive factor is diminished by his past procrastination.\nMoreover, his decision to finance the purchase of a $27,000 car while he still owes more than\n$12,000 for a repossessed vehicle leads me to question whether he has reformed his financial\nmanagement skills. Consequently, although Applicant\u2019s recent efforts at resolving his delinquencies\nconstitute a step in the right direction, it is too soon to conclude his financial situation no longer\nposes a security risk. Clearance is denied.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

After eight months of unemployment or part-time employment, he returned to work full-time.\nHe is the sole provider for his family. He has paid many of his smaller debts and has established\npayment plans on other debts, which he regularly pays. He has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns regarding his personal finances under Guideline F. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the\nSOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. On November 16, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He\nrequested a hearing. He submitted a supplemental notarized response on December 13, 2006.\nDOHA assigned this case to another administrative judge on January 16, 2007, and\ntransferred this case to me on April 25, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 17, 2007,\nwhich he timely received. I held a hearing on June 5, 2007, immediately following Applicant\u2019s return\nfrom an overseas work assignment. The government submitted 5 exhibits (GE), which were marked\nand admitted into evidence as GE 1-5, without objection. Applicant submitted 14 exhibits (App Ex),\nwhich were marked and admitted into evidence as App Ex A-N, without objection. Applicant\ntestified. I held the record open for Applicant to submit additional documentation, which he timely\ndid. He submitted 4 additional documents, which were marked and admitted as App Ex O-R, without\nobjection. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted subparagraphs 1.a. 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k, 1.p, and 1.q under Guideline F of the\nSOR. He neither admitted nor denied subparagraphs 1.c, 1.h., 1.s, 1.t, and 1.w, and asserted that\nsubparagraph 1.i. was the same as subparagraph 1.g. under Guideline F of the SOR.

The remaining allegations are deemed denied.  After a complete\n2\nreview of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant, a 37-year-old man, works as a technician and crew chief for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He has been employed with his company for almost five years. He filed an\napplication for a security clearance (SF-86) in May 2005.3\nApplicant married in 1996. He has an 11-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter. He\ngraduated from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1997 and anticipates receiving a\nmasters degree shortly. After college graduation, he worked steadily until April 2001, when his\nemployer laid him off due to a reduction in force. During the next eight months, he worked part-time.\nHe also received unemployment benefits. He obtained employment in December 2001 and has\nworked regularly since then.4\nIn 2001, his daughter required kidney surgery. His wife suffers from multiple medical\nproblems, including back problems and gall bladder problems, which prevent her from working. One\nyear ago, her back problems deteriorated significantly, requiring her to undergo surgery as did her\ngall bladder. After her surgery, she remained bedridden for sometime. His daughter required\nexpensive dental work last summer. In January 2006, his father-in-law died unexpectedly. In March\n2006, he purchased a larger home so that his mother-in-law could live with his family.5\nApplicant currently earns $44,000 a year, but anticipates that his salary will increase $15,000\nto $20,000 a year after he receives his masters degree. His monthly net pay is approximately $2,400.\nIn March 2007, he received approximately $485 in additional net pay and in May 2007, an additional\n$642 in net pay for overtime. His mother-in-law contributes $600 a month towards the family\nhousing costs. His job requires him to travel for significant periods of time, for which he receives\nper diem income to cover his out-of-town living expenses. Any excess per diem is used for\nhousehold expenses. His monthly expenses total approximately $3,500. He used this year\u2019s tax return\nto pay bills.6\nA review of Appellant\u2019s credit reports dated September 21, 2006, January 9, 2007, and the\nSOR shows 23 unpaid debts totaling $19,824.

He started his current\nemployment as a Technician I. He has been regularly promoted and is now a crew chief. His\nsupervisor would trust him with any available company project.9\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.10\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n11\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n12\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n13\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n14\nclearance decision.15\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n16\nId.\n17\nId.; Directive, revised AG \u00b6 2(b).\n18\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n19\n6\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n16\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n17\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n18\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n19\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individuals\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18.) Applicant has significant unpaid debt, some of\nwhich has remain unpaid for a number of years. Based on the evidence of record, DC \u00b6 19 (a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply to all allegations in the SOR, except 1.u and 1.v. In light of Applicant\u2019s denial of\nthese allegations, the government has not established its case because the identify of the creditor is\nnot shown in the credit reports. Thus, the Applicant has not way of knowing if he owes these debts.\nApplicant\u2019s employer laid him off from his job in April 2001. He did not obtain full-time\nemployment until 8 months later. In the same year, his young daughter required kidney surgery. In\naddition, his wife experienced continuing and ongoing medical problems, which prevented her from\nworking. Many of his unpaid bills are medical, and are the result of his wife\u2019s multiple medical\nproblems. His unemployment caused him to get behind in his bills some time ago. His wife\u2019s health\nand inability to work have contributed to his financial problems. MC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances applies. \nAlthough Applicant has never met with a financial counselor, he has contacted many of his\ncreditors. He negotiated settlement payments for some debts, paid other debts, and made\n\n7\narrangements to make monthly payments on several other debts. He started making the monthly\npayments he arranged in November 2006. As a result, some debts have been paid. He continues to\npay on others each month. He used his income tax return to pay some of his debts. Thus, MC \u00b6 20\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and MC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts apply. \nApplicant challenged the legitimacy of three debts in his response to the SOR. He\nacknowledged owing one debt, but did not recognized the other two debts. His challenge to these\ndebts in his response to the SOR is insufficient to trigger the application of MC \u00b6 20 (e) the\nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause\nof the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nApplicant is the sole financial provider for his family. Since his college graduation, he has\nworked steadily and regularly, with the exception of eight months in 2001. He lost his job in 2001\nas a result of a reduction in force. His job loss impacted his ability to meet his monthly financial\nobligations and to provide appropriate medical insurance for his family. Since returning to work full-\ntime, he has slowly improved his finances. His monthly bills are current. When his widowed mother-\nin-law came to live with his family, he needed to purchase a larger home as his home was too small.\nHis house payments increased. Even with the increased house payment, he has been able to slowly\nrepay some of his outstanding debts and make small monthly payments on other debts.\nApplicant anticipates that his income will increase after he receives his masters degree. His\nemployer respects his work abilities and has shown appreciation through regularly promotion over\na short period of time. He is a responsible individual. I have weighed the mitigating factors, the\nreasons for his debts, his current family situation, his efforts to repay his old debts on a tight budget,\nand his employer\u2019s confidence in him. I find that the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates\nthat he is a person of integrity, who is trustworthy. He would not act in a manner which would harm\nhis employer or the government. I conclude that he has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about\nhis finance. Accordingly, Guideline F is found in favor of Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-w: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant was never diagnosed as addicted to pornography. His belief that he was addicted arose through self-evaluation. 3 When Applicant attended college, his pornography viewing increased. The college had high speed internet connections which made it easier to access the pornography, especially the video files. Applicant believes he viewed pornography on a daily basis.

Applicant answered\nthe SOR in writing in an undated response, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge. The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 7,\n2007, scheduling the hearing for June 28, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. The Government offered two exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE)\n1 and 2, and admitted without objections. Applicant testified and offered one exhibit that was\nmarked Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on July 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is single with no children.\nHe holds a bachelor of science degree.2\nApplicant started viewing sexually explicit material, commonly referred to as pornography,\non the internet in about 1993, at the age of 13. While in high school, Appellant viewed pornography\nover the internet several times per week. By the time he turned 18, Applicant realized that his\nviewing pornography was probably an addiction. Applicant was never diagnosed as addicted to\npornography. His belief that he was addicted arose through self-evaluation.  \n3\nWhen Applicant attended college, his pornography viewing increased. The college had high\nspeed internet connections which made it easier to access the pornography, especially the video files.\nApplicant believes he viewed pornography on a daily basis. Applicant attended several colleges\nbefore he graduated. When he was not living at college, Applicant stayed at his parent\u2019s house. His\n\nGE 2 at 2.\n4\nTr. at 37-39, 50-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 7-8.\n5\nGE 2 at 3.\n6\nId.\n7\nTr. at 47-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 9-10.\n8\nTr. at 41-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 7.\n9\n4\nparents also had high speed internet. Applicant had a computer in his room, which made it easy to\nsatisfy his pornography habit.  \n4\nApplicant was employed by a company from 2000 to 2003. Applicant viewed sexually\nexplicit material while working for this company, using their computer. He stated he did this when\nhe was alone or when no one was in the area. On about ten occasions, Applicant stimulated his penis\nover his clothes with his hand, his arm, or by rubbing against his desk. He stated this would only last\na few seconds, and he never stimulated himself to ejaculation. He masturbated in the men\u2019s restroom\non about five occasions.  \n5\nApplicant stated that between about mid-2000 and 2003, his interests in pornography began\nto change. He had always been interested in the control aspect of sexually explicit videos. He began\nto seek out \u201cdominance\u201d videos, and specifically videos involving \u201crape\u201d scenes. He believes that\nmost of the rape videos were staged with actors and actresses. He believes he may have on one or\ntwo occasions viewed videos of actual rapes. He did not purposely attempt to find real rape scenes,\nas the thought of watching a real rape \u201cfreaks [him] out.\u201d  While searching the internet for\n6\npornography, Applicant inadvertently downloaded what appeared to be child pornography on two\noccasions.7\nApplicant accessed pornographic web sites through various means. He obtained passwords\nthrough a web site which provided free passwords to other sites. He also engaged in \u201cweb-spoofing,\u201d\nwhich is falsely mimicking one web site to gain access to another web site. Through these means,\nApplicant was able to access pornographic web sites which required a fee, without paying the fee.\nApplicant last used either of these methods in about February 2005.  \n8\nApplicant received counseling with several individuals between 2000 and 2003, for Attention\nDeficit Disorder (ADD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), his addiction to pornography, and\ncompulsive masturbation. Applicant feels the counseling did not help his pornography and\nmasturbation issues. Applicant and his counselor both agreed that pornography was wrong, but the\ncounselor did not believe there was anything inherently wrong with masturbation. Masturbation is\nagainst Applicant\u2019s religious beliefs, and he felt this fundamental difference in beliefs prevented the\ncounseling from succeeding in the areas of pornography and masturbation.  \n9\nApplicant worked for a friend who owned a tech company for about a month in May 2004.\n\nTr. at 39-40, 51-53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 5, 7.\n10\nTr. at 32-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 10-11.\n11\nTr. at 41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 7-8.\n12\nTr. at 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 4.\n13\nTr. at 42-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 8-9.\n14\nTr. at 52-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 6.\n15\n5\nApplicant was working late one evening at the company\u2019s one room office. No one else was working\nthat night. Applicant viewed pornography over the internet using his computer and the company\u2019s\nnetwork. He masturbated as he viewed the pornography. While he believed no one else was working\nthat night, Applicant admitted that if someone walked in, that he would have been in plain view.10\nIn about 2004, Applicant and his friend who owned the tech company, drove around\nsearching for businesses not adequately protecting their data. The friend had a laptop computer with\na wireless networking card. Applicant\u2019s friend operated the computer. The friend thought if he was\nable to access a business\u2019 data, then he could approach the business, show them that their network\nwas not secure, and attempt to generate business for his company. They found an open network at\na store, and looked inside the network and viewed credit card information. Applicant did not save\nthe information, nor did he release it or use it for any purpose. To the best of his knowledge, his\nfriend also did not save the data or do anything with it.11\nIn about mid-2005, Applicant masturbated while driving his car on a major freeway.\nApplicant stated he \u201cdid not ejaculate because [he] was concerned someone could see [him] and it\nwas unsafe.\u201d12\nApplicant was denied a Top Secret clearance by what is referred to as \u201cAnother Government\nAgency\u201d in about August 2005. Applicant believes the denial of his clearance was a catalyst for him\nto change his life, but he stated it was his religious beliefs which enabled him to change.13\nApplicant entered faith-based counseling for his pornography and masturbation in about\nOctober 2005. It started with individual meetings with his pastor, and grew into group meetings with\nthree other men with similar issues. The group conducted a 60-day course going through a religious-\nbased workbook, and ended in about January or February 2006. Applicant testified he viewed\npornography about once or twice during this period, and possibly once shortly after it ended.  \n14\nIn about July 2006, Applicant accessed web sites which contained pictures of partially\nclothed women on about five occasions. Applicant stated he unintentionally viewed a naked woman,\nand on another occasion, a naked man. Applicant was working for his current employer at the time,\nand accessed the web sites with a government computer. Applicant stated he felt he was heading\ndown the same path as before, and stopped accessing the sites.  \n15\nApplicant testified he has not viewed pornography, nor masturbated in an inappropriate place\nsince the incidents discussed above. Applicant believes through his counseling and renewed religious\n\nTr. at 56, 59-60; GE 2 at 4.\n16\nGE 2 at 12.\n17\nTr. at 49-50.\n18\nTr. at 35.\n19\nTr. at 34-36, 45-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 4.\n20\nAE A.\n21\n6\nbeliefs that he is cured of his self-described addiction to pornography and masturbation.  In his\n16\nstatement to an investigator on November 7, 2006, Applicant wrote:\nI do not have the intentions of viewing sexually explicit material in the workplace or\nmasturbate at any place of employment in the future; however, I cannot state\ndefinitively that I won\u2019t do these things again in the future. I cannot predict the\nfuture. It is like that I have no intention of getting in an accident while driving home,\nbut I can\u2019t control if in fact I get in an accident. I don\u2019t intend to do this activity at a\nworkplace in the future or anywhere. I don\u2019t want to and I can make the commitment\nthat to the best of my ability, I will not.17\nApplicant has informed many people, including family, friends, and associates about his\nissues with pornography and masturbation. Applicant testified that he could not be coerced or\nblackmailed by his actions because he is no longer addicted to pornography, and that if blackmailed,\nhe would reveal his actions as a way of sharing what God has accomplished.18\nWhile working at a defense contractor between September 2005 and September 2006,\nApplicant downloaded a video game to a government-owned computer. Applicant usually played\nthe game after work hours, but he also played it several times on company time. Applicant testified\nthat \u201c[i]t\u2019s generally company policy that during work hours, no, you don\u2019t do that.\u201d  No\n19\nindependent evidence was presented that this was against company policy. Applicant stated that he\nprovided technical support, and that probably 50% of his job was down time. He eventually removed\nthe video game from the computer.20\nApplicant submitted a letter from his assistant pastor. The pastor believes Applicant is\ntrustworthy, conscientious, and a man of his word. He believes Applicant has genuine regret over\npast decisions he made about pornography, but that Applicant \u201cdoes not carry guilt over his past\ndecisions, but has moved from guilt into genuine behavior change.\u201d21\nApplicant\u2019s called a witness on his behalf. The witness is the father of two young women that\nApplicant is friends with. Applicant shared with the witness that he had issues with pornography.\nThe witness took a mentor role with Applicant. He believes Applicant is very conscientious, with\n\nTr. at 19-28.\n22\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n23\nId. at 527.\n24\nExec.

The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n26\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n27\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n28\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n8\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional\ndisorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the individual to undue\ninfluence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nApplicant was obsessed with sexually explicit material, what is commonly referred to as\npornography, and masturbation. He regularly viewed pornography over the internet. He masturbated\nin inappropriate and public places. Based on all the evidence, Sexual Behavior Disqualifying\nCondition (SB DC) 13(b) (a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that\nthe person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder), SB DC 13(c)\n(sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress), and\nSB DC 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment)\napply in this case. \nApplicant sought counseling for his issues with pornography and masturbation. Seeking\ncounseling for these issues is a positive development. I do not find that Applicant\u2019s counseling\nsupports the application of any disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, and 1.j, are concluded for\nApplicant. \nI considered all the Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions (SB MC), and especially\nconsidered SB MC 14(b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such\nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), SB MC 14(c) (the behavior no longer serves as a\nbasis for coercion, exploitation, or duress), and SB MC 14(d) (the sexual behavior is strictly private,\nconsensual, and discreet).\nApplicant viewed pornography at work, and masturbated in inappropriate and public places.\nSB MC 14(d) does not apply. Applicant last masturbated in an inappropriate place about two years\nago. It has been about 18 months since he accessed pornographic web sites. Applicant received\nreligious-based counseling and now believes he is cured of his addiction. However, Applicant\naccessed web sites which contained pictures of partially clothed women on about five occasions after\nhis counseling, in about July 2006. I do not find that sufficient time has elapsed to support the\napplication of SB MC 14(b). Applicant has informed many people of his involvement with\npornography and masturbation. He testified that he could not be coerced or exploited because he\nwould be willing to reveal his past as a way of sharing what God has accomplished. Applicant has\nlessened the possibility of coercion, exploitation, or duress. SB MC 14(c) is at least partially\napplicable.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\n\n9\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant \u201cwas denied a Top Secret clearance by Another Government\nAgency in approximately September 2005.\u201d This is a true statement, but it is not an incident of\nquestionable conduct on Applicant\u2019s part. It reflects another agency\u2019s evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\nconduct. It raises no independent personal conduct concerns. SOR \u00b6 2.a is resolved in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor.\nApplicant downloaded a video game onto a government computer and played it after hours\nand during down periods at work. Applicant and his friend searched for and found an open network\nat a store, and looked inside the network and viewed credit card information. Applicant used\nquestionable means to access pornographic web sites without paying for them.\nThe above actions raise Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC)  16(c) (credible\nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information), PC DC 16(d) (credible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by\nitself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited\nto consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of propriety information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information; . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4) evidence\nof significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources), and PC DC 16(e)\n(personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may\naffect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . ).\nI have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) and I especially\nconsidered PC MC 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), PC MC 17(d) (the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), and PC MC\n17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress). \n\n10\nApplicant only played the video game on his own time or during down time at work. He\nremoved the video game from his government computer some time ago. The incident when\nApplicant and his friend accessed personal information was a one-time event. It was initiated by the\nfriend and there is no evidence the personal information was ever used. He has not used questionable\nmeans to access pornographic web sites without paying for them in more than two years. PC MC\n17(c), PC MC 17(d), and PC MC 17(e) are applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant developed a very unhealthy obsession with pornography and masturbation. This\nled to inappropriate actions at the workplace, and on the highway. His search for pornography and\n\u201crape\u201d videos resulted in inadvertently accessing child pornography, and what may have been an\nactual rape. Applicant\u2019s actions greatly increased his vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nand duress. Applicant\u2019s turning to religion to help him purge himself of these obsessions is\ncommendable. I am concerned by his failure in his statement to unequivocally commit that he would\nnot view pornography or masturbate in the workplace again. He equated accessing pornography and\nmasturbating at work to having a car accident. The analogy is incorrect. An accident is an\nunintentional event. Masturbating in the workplace is intentional conduct. \nApplicant appears to be on the right track. His witness and his pastor spoke very highly of\nhim. At this point it is still too early to tell if Applicant\u2019s obsession with pornography and\nmasturbation are the manifestations of a personality or emotional disorder, which will reveal itself\nagain. I am obligated to resolve my doubt in favor of protecting classified information.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct\nconcerns, but has not mitigated the security concerns based on his sexual behavior.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\n\n11\nParagraph 1.

As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 16, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. On December 20,\n2006, Applicant submitted an initial answer that was not considered responsive in that she failed to\nspecifically admit or deny SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 2.a,  or indicate whether she wanted a hearing.  By\n1\nletter dated January 18, 2007, Applicant was given ten days from receipt to provide her responses.\nOn January 23, 2007, Applicant answered \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 2.a and requested a decision based on the\nwritten record without a hearing.\nOn February 21, 2007, Applicant requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge,\nand the case was assigned to me on March 22, 2007. With the consent of the parties, I convened a\nhearing on May 8, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. The government presented one exhibit (Ex. 1),\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application, which was admitted without objection. Since Applicant\nelected to not testify on her behalf, Department Counsel called her as a witness. Applicant\u2019s case\nconsisted of one exhibit (Ex. A) and the testimonies of her sister, and a manager from her previous\njob. A transcript of the hearing was received on May 17, 2007. \nThe record was held open until May 22, 2007, for Applicant to submit a prognosis from a\ntherapist. Applicant timely submitted a one-page letter of discharge from a licensed mental health\ncounselor. The government had no objection and the document with its forwarding correspondence\nwas admitted as Exhibit B.\n\nDespite Applicant\u2019s admission to \u00b6 1.d, the evidence does not support that she received any treatment in early\n2\n2004. Applicant testified credibly that her treatment was all after she left the employ of the security services company\nin May 2004 (Tr. 90).\nApplicant testified she was not sure whether her present position requires her to maintain a security clearance,\n3\nalthough she understands that the company wants her to backup the facility security officer (Tr. 69-70). When Applicant\nwas offered her initial position with the company, she was informed that her employment was contingent on holding or\nbeing issued a DoD security clearance (Ex. A). Although she no longer holds the same position, there was no indication\nthat her employer had withdrawn its sponsorship of her clearance.\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant abused OxyContin with varying frequency\nto include up to three times daily, from about April 2004 to at least September 2004 (\u00b6 1.a), used and\npurchased cocaine from about 2000 to at least summer 2004 (\u00b6 1.b), used and purchased marijuana\nfrom about 1998 to at least summer 2004 (\u00b6 1.c), received inpatient treatment at a hospital for opiate\ndependence from about January 2004 to March 2004 (\u00b6 1.d),  received outpatient treatment at the\nsame facility from August 2004 to February 2005 for diagnosed adjustment disorder with anxiety\nand polysubstance dependence (\u00b6 1.e), and received treatment at an outpatient facility from March\n2004 to at least April 2006 (\u00b6 1.f). Under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately\nfalsified her May 2005 security clearance application (SF 86) by disclosing her illegal drug activity\nwith OxyContin only and not including her abuse of marijuana and cocaine (\u00b6 2.a).\nIn her answers to the SOR, and with respect to \u00b6 1.f at the hearing, Applicant admitted the\ndrug involvement and treatments as alleged,  but she denied any intentional falsification of her SF\n2\n86. After a thorough consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 24-year-old human resources generalist, who has worked for her employer, a\ndefense contractor, since May 2005. Initially hired as an administrative assistant, she was promoted\nat the end of her first year to the position of financial assistant. Effective July 2006, she assumed her\nhuman resources position where she is a payroll administrator. Applicant seeks a secret-level\nclearance for her duties.3\nApplicant has a history of drug abuse from about 1998 to summer 2004. She started using\nmarijuana as a high school freshman at age 15. She socialized with older students, including one who\nhad already graduated, because she wanted to be accepted. After about six months of intermittent\ninvolvement, she started smoking the drug a couple times per week. Seven to eight months after she\nfirst tried it, she began purchasing marijuana. Applicant knew her drug use was illegal and she\nworried about getting caught, but she chose to stay in contact with her same group of friends, and\nto use drugs with them, after she moved to another high school in November 1999.\nAt the beginning of her senior year of high school in Fall 2000, Applicant was offered\ncocaine by her friends. She decided to try it as everyone was using it, but she did not like the sense\nof heightened alertness that it caused. Four or five months later, she again accepted an offer from\nfriends to use cocaine, as she wanted to escape and not face reality. Applicant used cocaine thereafter\non occasion (\u201cprobably months apart from each other\u201d Tr. 79). She purchased cocaine a couple of\ntimes.\n\n4\nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant enrolled in a private college in August 2001\nbut left after only two months. She smoked marijuana a couple of times with other students on\ncampus during her brief stay.\nIn October 2001, she got a job as a receptionist for a security services company where her\nmother was employed. Since the company tested its employees for illegal drugs, Applicant scaled\ndown her drug involvement, although she continued to use marijuana and cocaine on occasion.\nApplicant also tried ecstacy once at age 19 or 20. Applicant did not allow her drug use to affect her\nwork, and she was given permit administration responsibilities. In January 2004, she was evaluated\nas an \u201cexemplary performer\u201d for her performance in 2003.\nIn April 2004, Applicant was given some OxyContin by her then boyfriend, whom she met\nat work. The OxyContin had not been prescribed for either Applicant or her boyfriend. Applicant\nenjoyed the effect of the drug and she used it again a couple of weeks later. After her fifth or sixth\nuse, she began ingesting the drug daily. Developing an addiction to OxyContin and not wanting to\nface her coworkers, Applicant decided to quit her job in May 2004. Unemployed until October 2004,\nApplicant abused primarily OxyContin up to multiple times daily that summer, although she also\nused cocaine at least once in August 2004. She depleted $6,000 to $7,000 of her savings because of\nher addiction to OxyContin.\nIn August 2004, Applicant checked herself into a hospital-affiliated outpatient treatment\nprogram. She was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with anxiety and with polysubstance\n(including opiate) dependence. For the first few weeks, she spent the day at the hospital where she\nwas prescribed withdrawal medication and was released to home at night. Applicant had a relapse\nwhile in the program, using OxyContin once in September 2004. Applicant continued the treatment\nprogram through February 2005.\nApplicant maintained her relationship with her boyfriend after she started rehabilitation\ndespite advice from her family and her counselors that it was not conducive to her recovery. She\ngave him chances to maintain a sober lifestyle, but he continued to check himself in and out of\nrehabilitation. After she ended the relationship in December 2004, he would not leave her alone. He\ngot physically abusive with her on one occasion, and in February 2005, she obtained a restraining\norder against him.\nIn about March 2005, Applicant began individual counseling with a licensed mental health\ncounselor (LMHC) who specializes in addictions. Applicant was referred to her by a psychiatrist.\nIn early May 2005, Applicant began working for her current employer as an administrative assistant\nat an annual salary of $33,000. Her employment was contingent or her holding or being issued a\nsecret clearance. In her offer letter, Applicant was informed she would have to submit  an SF 86 if\nshe did not have a current clearance.\nHer first day on the job, Applicant was asked to complete the SF 86. When she got to\nquestion 27 concerning any illegal drug use or misuse of prescription drugs since age 16 or within\nthe past seven years, Applicant had second thoughts about whether she wanted to complete the\napplication because of her drug abuse history. Told by the security officer that the information was\nconfidential to just the security officer, Applicant responded, \u201cYes\u201d to question 27 and listed use of\nOxyContin often from April 12, 2004 to August 2, 2004. She answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 19\n\n5\nconcerning any mental health consultation in the last seven years, and reported contact with the\npsychiatrist on August 10, 2004, and with the LMHC from August 13, 2004, to present. She did not\ninclude the hospital program by name, but indicated in response to question 43:\nAS STATED IN THE DRUG ABUSE SECTION I HAD A PROBLEM THAT\nLASTED ABOUT FOUR MONTHS WHICH I SOUGHT TREATMENT FOR AND\nCONTINUE TO. SINCE THEN I HAVE GONE THROUGH AN OUTPATIENT\nPROGRAM, GROUP SESSIONS THREE NIGHTS A WEEK FOR A MONTH\nAND AM NOW INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM AND SEE A LICENSED\nCOUNSELER [sic] EVERY OTHER WEEK. MY ADDICTION HAS BEEN\nUNDER CONTROL FOR SOME TIME NOW AND I PLAN TO KEEP IT THAT\nWAY. ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS CAN BE DIRECTED TO [LMHC\nname omitted] (COUNSELER) [sic] (HER INFO WAS LISTED IN ONE OF THE\nPREVIOUS MODULES.)\nApplicant\u2019s performance as an administrative assistant exceeded her employer\u2019s expectations.\nShe exhibited a great attitude, self-motivation, and willingness to help where needed. After her first\nyear on the job, Applicant was given a merit increase of 21.21% to $40,000 annually and promoted\nto financial assistant. Effective July 24, 2006, she was promoted to her present position at an annual\nsalary of $44,500.\nIn about November 2006, Applicant was discharged from her sessions with the LMHC. It\nwas a mutually agreed on termination. The LMHC assessed Applicant as psychiatrically stable and\nabstinent from all substances.\nApplicant has not used any illegal drug or abused OxyContin since her last use of OxyContin\nin September 2004. She does not intend to engage in illicit substance abuse in the future. As of May\n2007, Applicant was not receiving any counseling or attending meetings of Narcotics Anonymous\n(NA) or similar organization. She had been to NA in the past but feels confident enough in her\nrecovery at this point to where she does not feel she needs them. She would not hesitate to attend NA\nif she felt the need (\u201cBecause I feel that I\u2019m strong enough now, I know that they are there and I\nwouldn\u2019t hesitate to walk into one, should I need it, but I haven\u2019t felt that I needed one.\u201d Tr. 106).\nApplicant\u2019s family is supportive of her recovery. She is involved in a serious relationship\nwith someone who does not use illegal drugs. He is aware of her past drug use and that she has been\nin treatment. Sometime in Spring 2006, a distant friend of her boyfriend brought out some drugs in\nher presence during a gathering at her boyfriend\u2019s home. Her boyfriend took the initiative and asked\nthe person to leave. Applicant has not seen this person since then. She no longer socializes with\nknown drug users.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\n\n6\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H\u2014Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(AG \u00b6 24). Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs,\nmaterials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of\n1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens). (AG \u00b6 24(a)(1)). Just as abuse of marijuana or cocaine is considered drug abuse\nunder the Directive, so too is the use of a controlled drug such as OxyContin without a prescription\n(\u00b6 24(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction). \nDrug involvement disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 25(a) any drug abuse, and \u00b6 25(c) illegal\ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia, apply. Applicant used and purchased marijuana up to a couple\ntimes per week in high school and occasionally thereafter to sometime in summer 2004; used cocaine\non occasion from 2000 to a last use in August 2004, and purchased it at least twice; and abused\nOxyContin without a prescription to the point of addiction from April 2004 to September 2004,\ndepleting about $6,000 to $7,000 of her savings to support her habit. Although Applicant admits she\nwas diagnosed with opiate dependence in the hospital\u2019s outpatient treatment program, the\nqualifications of the clinician who rendered the diagnosis are not of record. The government\npresented no records from the hospital outpatient program or from the LMHC to confirm the\ndiagnosis. Applicant\u2019s admission is not sufficient in and of itself to apply  \u00b6 25(d), diagnosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug\nabuse or drug dependence, or  \u00b6 25(e), evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program.\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse of six years\u2019 duration and up to multiple times daily with respect to\nOxyContin in summer 2004 cannot reasonably be considered as happening so long ago or as so\ninfrequent, which is required under MC \u00b6 26(a), the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. However, Applicant is\ncredited with taking steps to resolve her drug problem starting in August 2004. While there is\nconflicting evidence as to the dates of her treatment, Applicant testified credibly that following about\nfour months of OxyContin abuse, she voluntarily entered a hospital\u2019s outpatient rehabilitation\nprogram. After a few weeks of intensive treatment where she received medication for withdrawal\nand was allowed home only to sleep, Applicant continued with group and individual counseling and\nsome NA sessions. In March 2005, she began a therapeutic relationship with a licensed mental health\ncounselor at the referral of a psychiatrist. Applicant continued her individual sessions until\nNovember 2006, when she was discharged psychiatrically stable and drug-free. This favorable\nprognosis by the LMHC does not carry the same weight as had it been rendered by the duly qualified\nmedical professional required under MC \u00b6 26(d), satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug\ntreatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without\nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. Under\nGuideline H, physicians, clinical psychologists, and psychiatrists are deemed duly qualified medical\nprofessionals.\nYet, her treatment was effective in bringing about a cessation of her drug abuse. As of May\n2007, she has 2 1/2 years of abstinence during which time she compiled a record of significant\naccomplishment at work. She no longer associates with those friends from high school with whom\nshe used marijuana, or with the boyfriend who introduced her to OxyContin and was her supplier\nof the drugs she abused in 2004. Nor is she likely to renew those connections when she is in a serious\nrelationship with a boyfriend who does not use any illegal drugs. When a distant friend of his pulled\nout an illegal drug at a social gathering, Applicant\u2019s boyfriend asked him to leave. Her family,\nincluding her sister who testified at her hearing, is also supportive of her ongoing sobriety. While\nan ongoing affiliation with NA or similar organization could provide additional guarantees about her\nrecovery, she testified credibly to a willingness to contact the LMHC or attend self-help meetings\nif she feels it necessary to maintain her sobriety. Peer pressure and the immature judgment of youth\nwere clearly factors in her drug use, and she has shown maturity, despite her still relatively young\nage, in taking the initiative to cope with her drug problem. Mitigating condition \u00b6 26(b), a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation, applies. \nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) Although Applicant disclosed her abuse\nof OxyContin in 2004 on her SF 86, she did not list her use of marijuana from 1998 to 2004 or of\ncocaine from 2000 to 2004 in response to the illegal drug inquiry. There is no question that Applicant\n\n8\nwas aware of her marijuana and cocaine abuse, but she has consistently denied any intentional\nconcealment. When she answered the SOR in December 2006, Applicant indicated that while she\nlisted only her OxyContin abuse, she requested in the comments section of the same application to\nspeak with someone in person so that she would have the opportunity to explain her drug use and\nprove how far she had come. She also provided DoD with the contact information for the individuals\nwho helped her. After she was asked to either admit or deny the alleged falsification of her SF 86,\nApplicant indicated on January 23, 2007:\nMy intention was never to falsify anything. I\u2019m not quite sure how to answer the\nabove (\u201cI admit\u201d or \u201cI deny\u201d). My intentions in answering question #27 the way I did\nwere entirely innocent. I listed my problem/dependency with oxy and asked that I\nspeak to someone in detail regarding my drug history. At that time I disclosed all\ninformation asked of me 100 % truthfully. I think it is pretty apparent that I did not\nintend to hide or falsify any information since I willingly listed all doctor\u2019s health\ncare facilities that I received treatment from. This information was given to them and\nretained in my medical file.\nA candid disclosure of her OxyContin abuse \u201coften\u201d from April to August 2004 does not relieve her\nof her obligation to report her less frequent but of longer duration involvement with marijuana and\ncocaine. However, a good faith belief that she had complied with her obligation would negate the\nwillful intent required under DC \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nAt her hearing, Applicant continued to maintain that she had written down in her comments\nthat if she could meet with someone in person, she would provide all the details (Tr. 109). A review\nof her SF 86 (Ex. 1) fails to confirm that she requested specifically to meet with an investigator.\nWhether she made a request in another document or verbally cannot be determined based on the\nrecord before me. Yet, I am persuaded Applicant did not intend to conceal her involvement with\nmarijuana and cocaine from the government. She indicated in the general remarks section of her SF\n86 that she had an addiction problem that lasted four months for which she was in treatment, and that\nany questions could be directed to her counselor. By August 2004, when she entered treatment for\nOxyContin abuse, she was not using marijuana and had used cocaine only one time that month, while\nshe was abusing OxyContin multiple times daily. Her OxyContin abuse was much more extensive\nat that point and immediate, thus understandably her focus. There is no evidence that Applicant ever\ndenied that she had been involved with illegal drugs such as cocaine or marijuana. Either Applicant\nherself or through admissions to her counselor is likely to have provided the details that led to the\nallegations of cocaine use and purchase in \u00b6 1.b and of marijuana use and purchase in \u00b6 1.c.  The\ngovernment did not allege, and there is no evidence to suggest, that Applicant lied to a government\ninvestigator. This is apparently also the first questionnaire that Applicant ever filled out and she was\nonly 22 years old at the time. Under the circumstances, her disclosure of only her OxyContin abuse\nwas not a knowing and willful misrepresentation.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\n9\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. AG \u00b6 2(a).  Applicant\ntried to escape her adolescent problems by turning to illegal drugs, primarily marijuana but also some\ncocaine. She allowed her boyfriend to turn her onto OxyContin, and she kept him in her life for\nmonths after she had started her own rehabilitation against the advice of her family and friends who\nsaw the threat to her own reform (\u00b6 2(a)(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct). Yet,\nshe has put the mistakes of her youth (\u00b6 2(a)(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct) behind her through her own efforts in seeking treatment, complying with her program, and\nchanging her environment and associates (\u00b6 2(a)(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes). Over the past two years, she has been promoted to positions\nof increasing responsibility with significant increases in her pay. There is no indication of any illegal\ndrug involvement since September 2004, while her work performance is consistent with maturation\nand an ability to safeguard classified information. There is little likelihood of her returning to her\ndrug abusing past (\u00b6 2(a)(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

On August 15,\n2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline E, and with respect to SOR paragraphs 1.a-1.u and\n1\n1.w-1.cc.  Those favorable findings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 22, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.\nRather, it contains new evidence, in the form of a statement from the Applicant and a document not\npreviously submitted by the Applicant.  This evidence indicates that Applicant has now resolved her\nsole outstanding debt, and attests to her good character and job performance.  The Board cannot\nconsider this new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party\nhas alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  It does not review cases de novo.  Applicant has not\nmade an allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple           \nMichael D.

Her debt problems resulted primarily from a leave without pay to care for her mother,\n\nExhibit (Ex.) 1 (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Standard Form (SF) 85P) is dated November 8, 2004,\n1\non the last page (\u201c8/18/04\u201d is crossed out the initials \u201cBPB\u201d appear nearby (R. 45)); Ex. 2 (SF 85P) is dated September\n17, 2002, on the last page. \nEx. 6 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 30, 2006).  The SOR is the source for all factual assertions\n2\nin the remainder of this paragraph.   \nEx. 7 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, notarized and sworn on October 12, 2006).  \n3\n2\nand unemployment resulting from her brain surgery. She received financial counseling and\nconsolidated most of her debts.  However, in 2006 she paid only $148 towards her SOR debts. There\nis insufficient evidence of financial progress towards elimination of her debts. Her erroneous\nstatements on two SF 85Ps were not made with an intent to deceive. She has not mitigated concerns\nabout financial considerations.  However, she has mitigated security concerns pertaining to her\npersonal conduct.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nThe Statement of Reasons (SOR) refers to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-\nR, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, and DoD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\n(Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\ndated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions of the Directive to resolve contractor\ncases involving trustworthiness determinations.  In this case, the pertinent disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive are the substantially the same.  Paragraph\nC8.2.1 of the Regulation provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply for contractor\npersonnel.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 17, 2002 and November 8, 2004, Applicant submitted Questionnaires for\nPublic Trust Positions (Standard Form (SF) 85P).   On August 15, 2006, DOHA issued a SOR to her,\n1\npursuant to the Directive and Regulation.   The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F\n2\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conditions).  The SOR detailed reasons why\nDOHA recommends that Applicant\u2019s case be submitted to an administrative judge for a\ndetermination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.\nIn a notarized, sworn answer, received at DOHA on October 16, 2006, Applicant responded\nto the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.   On October 31, 2006, the\n3\ncase was assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 30, 2006.  At the hearing I approved\nApplicant\u2019s request that I hold the record open so she could submit additional documentary evidence\n(R. 62). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (R.) on December 13, 2006, and I received it\non December 14, 2006.  Department Counsel had no objection to my consideration of the evidence\nApplicant provided, and I admitted her additional evidence (Ex. K) on January 3, 2007.    \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nThe source for all factual assertions in this paragraph is Ex. 7, supra n. 3.\n4\nEx. 1, supra n. 1, at 1 (date of birth); R. 6.\n5\nId., question 11 at 3 (employment).\n6\nId., question 16, at 6 (military service).\n7\nId., question 10, at 2 (education); R. 6.\n8\nId., questions 14 and 15, at 5 (marital status and relatives); R. 22.\n9\n3\nAs to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible\nfor the 29 debts listed on the SOR, but also indicated one SOR debt was a duplication.   Her\n4\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings\nof fact.\nApplicant is 44 years old.   For the last 13 years, she has been employed by a United States\n5\ngovernment contractor, and she is involved with processing sensitive medical records.    She has\n6\naccess to social security numbers and other private information (R. 6-7). She has no prior military\nservice.   She has a high school diploma.\n7\n8\nIn 2000 and 2001, her grandmother became ill, and Applicant took leave from her job to care\nfor her (R. 27, 35).  Her grandmother died in May of 2001 (R. 29).  The last couple months of her\ngrandmother\u2019s life, Applicant only worked a day or two per week (R. 29).  \nApplicant had back surgery in the late 1980s and again in the early 1990s (R. 33, 35).  She\nhad brain surgery in 2004 (R. 33).  She was unable to work from November 2004 to January 2005\n(R. 34).  At first she used up her sick leave (R. 34).  Then she received disability pay of 60 percent\nof her salary for four weeks ( R. 34).  However, there was a 2-3 week gap where she did not receive\nany income (R. 34).\nApplicant was married in 1980, and has two children (born in 1980 and 1986).   She assists\n9\nher children with college tuition (R. 27, 44).  For example, she provided her daughter $600 the last\nhalf of 2006.  Her husband is employed, but she does not know his income (R. 23).  For the 26 years\nof their marriage, he has kept his money in a separate account (R. 23, 24).  She pays the family bills,\nand he provides $400 to $500 per month to her (R. 23, 24).    Her husband\u2019s support is inconsistent.\nOver the years of their marriage, her husband was moved in and out of her residence (R. 27).  \nApplicant made payments on some of her delinquent accounts from 2000 to 2006 ( R. 28).\nHowever, few of her creditors were willing to accept small payments (R. 28).  She waited until\nNovember 2006 to seek credit counseling because she did not believe she had such bad credit until\nshe reviewed the credit reports (R. 41).  Her employer provided financial counseling services to her\nfor free (R. 41).  On November 2, 2006, and her credit counselor told her to contact her creditors (R.\n40, 53-56).  Her credit counselor made suggestions about how she could reduce her expenses (R. 54).\nThey also made plans about tracking expenses and setting up a budget (R. 54, 68).   She has begun\ncutting back her expenses, and her daughter has cut her expenses too (R. 68).\n\nShe did not make payments from 1999 to late 2006 because she believed this debt was paid (R. 25).  Applicant\n10\nprovided a letter dated November 6, 2006, from the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor requesting a partial payment of $78 (Ex. D).  A\nMoney Gram payment document for $78 is Ex. E.  She said the remainder would be paid in 30 days (R. 25).\nHer 1997 Chevy Blazer was repossessed (R. 29-30; Ex. 5).  She was unaware of details such as how much she\n11\npaid for it, and what it was sold for after it was repossessed (R. 30).  The creditor was willing to accept three large\npayments to take care of the delinquency, but they were unwilling to accept smaller, regular payments (R. 42).  \nApplicant said she dispute the debt, asserting that she terminated her contract for television services early\n12\n(R.31). She conceded a termination fee was in her contract (R. 31).  Applicant requested updated information on her\naccount, and the creditor informed her that the debt was $313 (Ex. K at 7).  \nIn a letter dated November 29, 2006, the creditor agreed to settle the debt of $4,691 for $3,565 with payments\n13\nof $40 per month, starting January 15, 2007 (Ex. C; R. 32).  Applicant\u2019s signature does not appear on the settlement\nagreement (Ex. C).  \nDuring her OPM interview on November 11, 2005, Applicant said she would attempt to resolve her medical\n14\ndebts.  In a letter dated November 23, 2006, the medical creditor offered to settle all of their medical bills for $2,051,\npayable $50 per month (R. 35-36; Ex. K at 11).  Applicant signed the settlement agreement (Ex. F).  A receipt shows4\nApplicant currently drives a 2003 Chevy Malibu (R. 43).  She made payments on it, and now\nthe lien is completely paid (R. 43).  The lien on her husband\u2019s 1989 Ford Ranger is also paid in full\n(R. 43). \nIn her response to the SOR, dated October 12, 2006, she stated, \u201cI am now in the process of\ncontacting each company on the [SOR] to make arrangements to satisfy all debt. . . . I now\nunderstand and agree I have neglected to satisfy the debt[,] but I will begin to correct the situation.\nI am responsible for all this debt. It is my hope that at the hearing I will be able to provide\ndocumentation showing I have satisfied some of the debt and that I am working on satisfying all of\nthe debt.\u201d\nThe following table provides the amount of each SOR debt and the its current status:\nSOR \u00b6\nAmount\n    in $\nDate Last\nAction on\nAccount\nType Account \nStatus\n1.a\n155\nMarch 1999 \nJewelry\nPartial payment made10\n1.b\n1,412\nJanuary 2000\nLoan\nDuplication of SOR \u00b6 1.f (R.\n32-33)\n1.c\n1,255\nMarch 2000\nCredit\nAmount of debt disputed (R.\n28-29)\n1.d\n11,805\nMay 2000\nCar repossession\nDelinquent debt11\n1.e\n134\nApril 2001\nCable\nDelinquent debt12\n1.f\n4,422\nMay 2001\nLoan\nDelinquent debt13\n1.g\n85\nAugust 2001\nMedical \nPayment plan14\n\na $50 payment on December 14, 2006 (Ex. K at 11).   Her next payment is due January 11, 2007 (Ex. K at 11).\nShe received a bill for $400, and paid $294, which she thought was the correct amount (R. 38-39; 47-50).  She\n15\ndid not provide a receipt showing this $294 payment.  This large cell phone bill resulted from calls her family made from\noutside their calling area (R. 49).  After she made the $294 payment, she did not receive any correspondence from\ncreditor (R. 38-39).  She recently learned over the telephone that the debt was $294, but further information would be\nprovided (R. 48).  Applicant requested information about account from creditor on December 13, 2006, using email (Ex.\nK at 6).  The financial services section responded that they did not show a balance owed, and instructed her to dispute\nthe debt with the credit reporting agency (Ex. K at 6).  \nShe acknowledged the accuracy of the $767 balance she owed to an investigator from the Office of Personnel\n16\nManagement (OPM) (Ex. 5).  At her hearing, she said she had made payments on this debt during the last three years\n(R. 58). I advised Applicant that it was important to the decision in her case that she make her first payment on her\nsatellite television debt (R. 59-61).  I left the record open to permit her additional time to provide evidence of her\npayment (R. 61-62).  On December 10, 2006, Applicant said that she learned the debt was $313 (Ex. K at 5, 7; R. 39-40),\nand asked for a settlement agreement. Id. Her memorandum of January 1, 2007, states the settlement agreement she\nreceived reflected a different debt amount (Ex. K at 5). She did not provide any evidence showing a payment or partial\npayment on her satellite television debt.   \nEx. B (Applicant\u2019s spending plan prepared with the assistance of her financial counselor in November 2006).\n17\nThis paragraph is derived from Applicant\u2019s 2006 PFS and R. 39-41, unless stated otherwise. \n5\n1.h\n78\nAugust 2001\nMedical \nPayment plan14\n1.i\n174\nMay 2002\nTelephone\nDelinquent debt\n1.j to 1.t\n1,601\nNovember 2002\nMedical\nPayment plan14\n1.u\n294\nDecember 2003\nCell phone\nDisputed debt15\n1.v\n762\nJuly 2004\nSatellite\ntelevision\nDelinquent debt16\n1.w\n60\nNovember 2004\nMedical\nPayment plan14\n1.x\n59\nJuly 2005\nMedical\nPayment plan14\n1.y\n110\nOctober 2005\nMedical\nPayment plan14\n1.z\n18\nNovember 2005\nMedical\nPayment plan14\n1.aa\n146\nNovember 2005\nMedical\nPayment plan14\n1.bb\n20\nFebruary 2006\nMedical\nPayment plan14\n1.cc\n69\nJanuary 2003\nFine for bad\ncheck\nPaid\u2013resulted from error in\nbalancing checkbook (R. 44)\nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS) prepared in early November 2006  indicated\nher monthly net pay after deducting ten percent for retirement is $3,127.   She listed monthly\n17\nhousehold expenses as follows:  rent ($351), groceries ($200), clothing ($75), utilities ($300), car\nexpenses ($100), taxes ($150), children\u2019s expenses ($500), insurance ($655), debt payments ($150),\nand miscellaneous ($285).  She did not list any other debt payments or other liabilities.  After\n\nHer November 28, 2005, PFS was part of her OPM interview.  It substantially differed from her 2006 PFS\n18\nin the areas of monthly gross pay ($2,997), net pay ($1,845), car payment ($260), gasoline ($240), and gifts/college\nexpenses ($150).  The OPM PFS did not include an explaination of the differential between her gross pay and her net\npay.  The net monthly remainder after deducting monthly expenses and other deductions was $13 per month.\nThe Security Clearance Application Standard Form (SF) 86 (September 1995 version) was not used in this\n19\ncase because the issue is Trustworthiness or Public Trust, rather than a security clearance.  It is noteworthy that the SF\n86 has two Questions concerning debts:  Question 38.  \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies - 180 days  In the last 7 years,\nhave you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and Question 39.  \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies - 90 days\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d  By asking the question two different ways, and seeking two\ndifferent types of information, there is less of an opportunity for mistakes.  SF 86 Question 39 apparently seeks\ninformation that is not included in Question 38. In any event, the use of the 7-year qualifier in Question 38 versus the\n\u201ccurrent\u201d qualifier in Question 39 is relevant because Applicant apparently applied a \u201ccurrent\u201d qualifier to her answer\nto Question 22b.        \nEx. 5 (summary of Applicant\u2019s oral statement to special investigator for the OPM Investigations Service on\n20\nNovember 28, 2005).\n6\ndeducting all expenses, she had a positive cash flow of $111 per month.  This monthly net pay did\nnot include her husband\u2019s salary (R. 66).  He provides about $400 to $500 per month to their\nhousehold (R. 67).  After paying all expenses she believed she has more than $111 left over each\nmonth, and perhaps as much as $300 or $400 per month (R. 67).  She did not explain why $655 is\nallocated for insurance payments.  Her November 28, 2005, PFS was somewhat different from the\nPFS she provided to her financial counselor in 2006.  \n18\nTwo character witnesses who have known Applicant for many years described her as\nintelligent, honest, trustworthy, inquisitive, diligent, respectful and having excellent leader qualities,\nespecially integrity (Ex. K at 3, 12).  Applicant provided three of her performance reviews, which\nshowed solid work performance on behalf of the government contractor (Ex. H, I and J).     \nPersonal Conduct\nQuestion 22b of her 2002 and 2004 SF 85Ps asks, \u201cYOUR FINANCIAL RECORD  Are\nyou now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?  Include loans or obligations\nfunded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.\u201d   Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges\n19\nthat this answer is false.  Her 2005 statement to an OPM investigator did not mention the\nfalsification issue (Ex. 5).   The following colloquy between Department Counsel and Applicant\n20\nprovides her explanation for answering, \u201cNo\u201d to Question 22b:\nQ.  Okay.  You were aware that you had accounts that had been placed for collection,\nweren\u2019t you?\nA.  I did not understand that question that way.  I answered it the way I thought it,\nyou know, should have been answered, but I didn\u2019t willfully not, you know, mis-\nanswer (sic) it.  I honestly didn\u2019t understand.  And I didn\u2019t understand, like, for\nexample, when the car was repossessed, that I actually still \u2013 actually still [was]\nunder the contract.  I didn\u2019t understand that.  I thought once they did that, that I was\nstill considered delinquent until (sic).  But I understand now that I\u2019m considered\ndelinquent until it shows a zero balance.  But I did not understand that, then.\n\n7\nQ. What did you think the notices from them after they sold it meant?\nA. That I owed them.  But I didn\u2019t know I was still considered delinquent.\nQ.  Were you \u2013 \nA.  I mean, I just misunderstood.  I just mis \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t have a fancy\nexplanation.  I just misunderstood.\nR. 46-47.  She reiterated that she \u201ctotally misunderstood that question\u201d (R. 63-64).  She mentally\nlimited the adjective, \u201cdelinquent\u201d in Question 22b to those debts and bills that she was \u201cactually\ncurrently paying\u201d (R. 64).  For example, at the time she answered Question 22b she was making car\npayments of $260 per month, and this debt was current and not delinquent (R. 64).  When her SF\n85P was prepared, no one was around to answer her questions.  However, she did  receive guidance\nfrom other contractor employees (R. 64).     \n \nI carefully observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor as she addressed the falsification of her SF 85Ps.\nI am convinced she answered, \u201cNo\u201d because she truly misunderstood what information the\ngovernment was seeking.  She mentally limited the inquiry to delinquent debts that she intended to\npay.  At her hearing she responded in a forthright, candid manner to the best of her ability.  After\nconsidering all the record evidence, I find that she was truthful about her intent, and her answer on\nQuestion 22b was an honest mistake, rather than a deliberate lie.\nPOLICIES \nIn the evaluation of an Applicant\u2019s security suitability for a public trust position, an\nadministrative judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC).   \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the\nRegulation.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision.\nTo be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Regulation.  \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties\nis that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are\nsuch that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.\u201d  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Regulation, Appendix\n8.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\n21\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n8\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in\nthe Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the Conclusions section below.\nSince the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final\ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position\nis \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn\nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.  The\n21\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to\napprove eligibility for a public trust position. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  If the government meets its initial\nburden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s\ncase.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No.\n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information\nis clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP\npositions.\nA person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The scope\nof an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are\nnot at issue in these proceedings. \n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n22\n9\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay her\ndebts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government\ninformation. Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government\u2019s concern regarding\nfinancial considerations, stating, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts\nor is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect\nsensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d\nand FC DC 3, \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d  The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.u became\ndelinquent between 1999 and December 2003.  The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v to 1.bb became delinquent\nbetween July 2004 and February 2006.  Twenty-one of her SOR debts have been delinquent for more\nthan three years.  Applicant established that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.cc was paid.  She began two\npayment plans for twenty SOR debts, and made her first payment on each account.  One debt was\na duplication.  The amounts of two SOR debts were disputed.  Five SOR debts are currently\ndelinquent, including one SOR debt that was not barred by the 3-year South Carolina statute of\nlimitations for debts.           \nFC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her failure to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that\nshe was unable to pay the debts, which then became delinquent and remained delinquent. The\ngovernment produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  The burden of disproving\na mitigating condition never shifts to the government.22\nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, \u201cthe behavior was\nnot recent;\u201d FC MC 2, \u201cit was an isolated incident;\u201d FC MC 3, \u201cconditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;\u201d FC MC 4, \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control;\u201d and FC MC 6, \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d   \n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd.\n23\nMay 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole. \nThe Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or\n24\notherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts.  The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019  However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  In ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999), the Appeal Board\nspecifically addressed application of the statute of limitations, stating a \u201cperson who decides not to honor his or her debts\nmay be able to avoid paying those debts until they are legally uncollectible because the statute of limitations has run.\nReliance on the running of a statute of limitations would be a legally permissible course of action.  However, it would\nnot demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s debts that would fall under the meaning of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 03-10880 (App. Bd. June 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 (App. Bd.\nMar. 27, 2003) (stating an applicant must do more than merely cite the statute of limitations to obtain the full benefit of\nFC MC 6). See also ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003) (\u201c[E]ven if a delinquent debt is legally\nunenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding\nan applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 98-0349 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 3, 1999) (even though an applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were not legally collectible because of the statute\nof limitations, that fact did not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the applicant\u2019s failure to resolve the\ndelinquent debts before the statute of limitations ran). Cf. ISCR Case No. 01-04425 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 17, 2002)\n(adverse Guideline F conclusions possible where applicant chose not to pay her delinquent debts, waited until her\ncreditors ceased trying to collect those delinquent debts, and they were eventually dropped from her credit report.).10\nThe Regulation does not define \u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what\nconstitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,  I\n23\nconclude FC MCs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple delinquent SOR debts.  \nFC MC 3 partially applies to all of her SOR debts because the debts became delinquent as\nthe result of her periodic unemployment, including her absence of work to support of mother who\nwas ill.  Her brain surgery incapacitated her from working from November 2004 to January 2005,\nand caused a significant loss of income and multiple medical debts.  These changes in family\ncircumstances are good examples of the unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3,\ncausing financial problems that may be \u201clargely beyond the person\u2019s control.\u201d  Applicant, however,\ndoes not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she has made insufficient financial progress since\nreturning to work in January 2005.  There is a paucity of evidence showing how she endeavored to\npay or resolve her SOR debts over the last two years, especially after her OPM interview on\nNovember 28, 2005, made her aware of the security significance of her financial problems. \nShe received financial counseling, and receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there\nare some indications that the problem is being resolved and she is gaining control of her financial\nsituation.  In regard to application of the statute of limitations, FC MC 6 does not apply because\nthere is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of\nher debts.   After receiving the SOR on August 15, 2006, she made an $78 payment resolving half\n24\nof the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and she made a $50 payment on the consolidated debt for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.h;\n\nIn ISCR Case No. 03-10380, 2006 Lexis 37, at *22 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n25\nApp. Bd. June 9, 2004), the Board stated:\n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving\nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind at the time the omission occurred. In that decision, the Board went on to state that\ngiven the record evidence in that case, it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude Department\nCounsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted\nto the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission. \n11\n1.j-1.t; and 1.w-1.bb.  These two payments are insufficient in magnitude to warrant application of\nFC MC 6.  Most importantly, her past conduct in generating and failing to resolve her delinquent\ndebts over the last seven years is most relevant to security concerns relating to financial\nconsiderations, and weighs against mitigating financial considerations.\nPersonal Conduct       \nUnder Guideline E, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncould indicate that [applicant] may not properly safeguard classified information.\u201d   \nTwo personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could potentially raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 2 applies where there has been \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  A security concern may result under PC DC\n3 when an applicant deliberately provides \u201cfalse or misleading information concerning relevant and\nmaterial matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official\nrepresentative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\u201d  \nFor PC DCs 2 and 3, Applicant gave a false answer to Questions 22b of her 2002 and 2004\nSF 85Ps.  The evidence of record, however, does not establish falsification of Question 22b by\nsubstantial evidence.  Although she admitted preparing her trustworthiness questionnaire, and\nanswering incorrectly, she did not fully understood the question.   At the time she completed the\n25\nSF 85P, she thought that the answer she provided was correct.  Her statements show confusion\nabout which debts were supposed to be disclosed.   \nA security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by substantial evidence of\npersonal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC).  Under PC MC 1, security concerns may be\nmitigated when the derogatory \u201cinformation was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination\nof judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.\u201d  The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are not\nestablished by substantial evidence.  The erroneous answer was a mistake, and was not made with\nintent to deceive. \n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n26\n12\nIn sum, I am satisfied that Applicant\u2019s erroneous answer to Question 22b was a mistake\ncaused by her misunderstanding of the question.  She honestly believed that the correct answer was,\n\u201cNo\u201d at the times she provided it.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix\n8, at 132. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations,\nand inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is\ncurrently 44 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her\nactions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely fashion were knowledgeable and\nvoluntary.  Her debt problems resulted from voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However, her\ninability to repay her debts resulted from her unemployment, her care for her mother, and her\nmedical problems.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and\nimproved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and the almost complete absence of new\ndelinquent, unpaid, non-medical debt over the last three years.  Moreover, changes in her financial\nhabits resulting from her financial counseling shows signs of financial improvement in the future.\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress should decrease in the future, providing\nshe applies the financial counseling she is receiving.  Moreover, Applicant was able to pay some\nnon-SOR debts, as demonstrated by payment of her car loan.  \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.u are not collectible because of the 3-year South Carolina\nstatute of limitations.  See S.C. Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530 (listing the statute of limitations for various\ndebts); Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C.\nCt. App. 2005) (explaining the societal value of application of the statute of limitations to\ndelinquent debts).  The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j-1.t, and 1.w to 1.bb are included as part\nof two new consolidated payment plans.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.cc is paid.  Greater awareness of\nfinancial responsibilities through financial counseling, and her recent steps to determine the scope\nof her debts and to consolidate many of them, should result in a trend of improved financial\ncircumstances.\nNevertheless, her total payments since August 15, 2006 on her delinquent SOR debts totaled\n$128.  There have not been any payments on the debt sin SOR \u00b6 1.v ($313) even though it is not\nbarred by the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations for debts.  There is an insufficient history\nthat she is financially responsible, and able to live within her means. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, all facts and circumstances, the mitigating and aggravating\nevidence weighing for and against her, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not\nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility and suitability is not supported by substantial\nevidence. I take this position based on the law, my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person\nfactors\u201d  and supporting evidence, as well as my application of the pertinent factors under the\n26\nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities.  For the reasons stated, I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for a public trust position. \n\n13\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.u: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.w to 1.cc:     For Applicant\n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.b: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\nMark W. Harvey\nAdministrative Judge\n",

While she has performed well in her\nposition for two years, she has only paid two debts out of ten.  She states she plans to pay the other\ndebts, but failed to develop a payment plan or challenge the debts with the remaining creditors.\nConsequently, she failed to mitigate the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F.  Eligibility for\ntrustworthiness is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to\ngrant the application  for a position of public trust under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the\n\"Directive\").    Consequently, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for\n1\nits decision and  alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) in paragraph\n1.  In her notarized Answer dated December 9, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand denied paragraph 1 but admitted all of the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.j., and\nrequested a hearing. \nOn January 26, 2007, Department Counsel noted the case was ready to proceed.  The matter\nwas assigned to another judge on February 2, 2007. Subsequently, a Notice of Hearing, issued on\nFebruary 22, 2007, set the matter for March 8, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works and\nlives.  The case was re-assigned to me on March 5, 2007, because of the unavailability of the\nprevious judge.  \nAt the hearing on March 8, 2007, Applicant waived her right to 15 days notice of the hearing,\nwhich was conducted as scheduled. (TR 7)  The government submitted six exhibits which were\nmarked and admitted into the record as Exhibits 1-6 without objection. (TR 16-18)  Applicant\nsubmitted three exhibits which were marked and admitted into the record as Exhibits A-C without\nobjection. (TR 19-20)   She testified on her own behalf. The record was held open for two weeks\nuntil March 22, 2007, to allow Applicant to submit further documents.  (TR 59-62; 69;  81)  She\nsubmitted additional documents by March 22, 2007, which were marked and admitted as Exhibits\nD through F on March 23, 2007, as Department Counsel stated she had no objection. The record\nclosed on March 23, 2007.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (TR.) on March 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted to all specific SOR allegations, but denied\nparagraph 1 under Guideline F. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a\nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings\n\n3\nof fact.\nApplicant, a 26-year-old woman seeking a position of public trust, has worked as an intake\nrepresentative claims associate for a Department of Defense contractor for two years since March\n2005. (Exhibit 1; Exhibit D)  \nApplicant has technical college training as a \u201cmedical biller\u201d which she received in May\n2004.  (Exhibit 1) \nFinancial Considerations\nShe has never married, but has a boyfriend and two children ages ten and eight whom she\nsupports without any child support from their fathers. (Exhibit 1; TR 15; 35; 68)  Applicant\nexplained that she has been on her own since she was 14 years old and moved in with her first\nboyfriend who was 16 and his family.  She later moved to another city at age 17 to live with her\ncurrent boyfriend when she was pregnant; she began to have financial problems at that time in 1999.\nShe learned that her father\u2019s insurance would not cover the birth of her son, and she was too young\nto apply for county assistance.  (TR 20-21; 34)  Her current boyfriend for nine years does not work;\nshe supports him as he has been unemployed for seven years.  (TR 36-37; 55; 64-67; 68) For\nexample, when he could not pay the gas bill, she had it switched to her name but had to pay off his\ndebt in December 2006 in order to have the account transferred.  (TR 46) She also recently chose\nto pay towards another credit card debt that took her focus off paying the debts itemized in the SOR.\n(Exhibit 4; TR 57-58)\nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated April 21, 2005, August 18, 2006, January 12,\n2007, her response to the Interrogatories, and her Answer to the SOR show 10 unpaid debts totaling\napproximately $10,000. (Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 6)  The current status of these debts is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT (date)\nAMOUNT\nCURRENT STATUS\n1.a\nCollection account for\ntowing in March 2004\n$     1,307.00\nUnpaid; in February 2007\nshe made arrangements to\npay $150 per month with\npost-dated checks.  In March\n2007 she paid this $1,662\ndebt in full and had a zero\nbalance.  (TR 23, 37-38, 44;\nExhibits A, E)\n1.b.\nCollection account for\ncable from 2005\n$       304.00\nUnpaid as she stated the\ncable company could not\nfind the account; however,\nthe debt is still reflected on\nher 2007 credit report.  She\nhas not asked that it be\nremoved.  (TR 27-28; 42-44)\n\n4\n1.c\nCollection account for\ndebt delinquent since\n2001\n$     71.00\nApplicant paid this account\nin February 2007. (Exhibit B;\nTR 24, 28; 44-45)\n1.d\nCollection account for\ncable from 2003\n$     491.00\nUnpaid as the cable company\ncould not find the account;\nhowever, the debt is still\nreflected on her 2007 credit\nreport and she has not asked\nthat it be removed.   (TR 28-\n29; 42-44)\n1.e\nCollection account for\nbroadband in 2001\n$       166.00\nUnpaid.  She explained she\nwas mistaken when she\nstated in her Answers to the\nInterrogatories that she had\n\u201cmade payment\narrangements\u201d for this debt. \n(Exhibit 2; TR 29)\n1.f\nCollection account from\nlibrary from 2002 \n$     292.00\nUnpaid; she has the books,\nbut has not returned them as\nshe was \u201cbeing lazy.\u201d (TR\n30)\n1.g\nCollection account from\n2000\n$ 3,530\nAccount was charged off in\nSeptember 2000; Applicant\nmade a phone call to the\nhospital to learn the status,\nbut the bill remains unpaid. \nThey advised she still owes\njust $731 and $407.50; but\nshe provided no\ndocumentation on how this\ndebt was reduced. (TR 22-\n24; 30-31, 47-51)\n1.h\nCollection account from\nfire department \n$ 593.00\nUnpaid; she does not know\nwhy she owes this money\nand has not investigated. \n(TR 31; 51-52)\n1.i\nCollection account for\ntelephone\n$2,939.00\nUnpaid for land line\ntelephone bill.  (TR 32)\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n2\n5\n1.j\nCollection account from\ntowing \n$ 550.00\nUnpaid; she believes this bill\nis a duplicate of 1.a.;\nhowever she conceded that it\nmight be another debt as she\nhad two different account\nnumbers and two bills. (TR\n33; 39-41)\nApplicant\u2019s  monthly pay is $2,100. (TR 25)  Her monthly expenses total  $2,099 including\n$685 for rent, $50 for electricity, $50 for gas, $59 for telephone, $400 for groceries; $160 for\ngasoline, $200 for car insurance; $60 for a credit card payment; $185 for a car payment, and $150\nfor one debt payment, $100 for clothing.  She has another credit card to cover dental expenses for\nher children where she owes $800 and is paying $25 per month.  (Exhibit C; TR 25-26; 37-38)  The\n2007 credit report showed another debt for $560; however, she disputed that debt.  (Exhibit 4; TR\n52-53)  She has been trying to pay her debts one at a time but they have her \u201cemotionally frustrated.\u201d\n(TR 54)  She intended to try to contest certain debts, but has not done so.  (TR 55)\nIn November 2006 after she received the SOR, Applicant called a credit counseling agency\nto help resolve her credit problems, but was advised she would be better of paying each debt on her\nown as that would help raise her credit score.  She has not explored bankruptcy or developed a plan\nto pay her remaining overdue bills.  (TR 26; 34; 56-57)  \nReferences and Evaluation\nApplicant submitted numerous references for her co-workers stating that she is a hard worker\nand gets along well with everyone at work.  She was also assessed as being honest and polite.   Her\nlead supervisor stated she holds Applicant in \u2018high regard as she is always polite, punctual and\npleasant.\u201d She is efficient and valued as an employee.   (Exhibit D)\nHer March 2007 evaluation documents stated that she achieved her goals which is a mid-\nrange evaluation.  (Exhibit F)\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n2\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n3\n Id.\n4\n Id.\n5\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n6\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n8\n6\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by\nknown sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n3\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\n4\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n5\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n6\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n7\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n8\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n9\n  AG \u00b6 20 (a)  the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\n10\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\n  AG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\n11\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\n7\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n9\nfor access to sensitive positions. (Exhibit 3)\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nAfter carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, I conclude the\ngovernment established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability or trustworthiness.  Based\non all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a) Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and 19(c) A history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to\nApplicant's case. Applicant has many unpaid, delinquent debts documented by her credit reports dated\nApril 21, 2005, August 18, 2006, January 12, 2007, her response to the Interrogatories, and her\nAnswer to the SOR.  The 10 debts alleged total approximately $10,000.  While she recently paid two\ncreditors, she has not made an effort or developed a plan to resolve the remaining eight debts.  While\nshe was advised by a credit counseling service to approach her debts on a one by one basis, she has\nsuch limited funds that she has made only limited progress.  In February 2007 she resolved only one\nsmall debt from 2001 (SOR 1.c.) and in March 2007 she paid one large debt for towing her car from\n2004 (SOR 1.a.).  Another debt for towing her car (1.j) remains unresolved as well as debts to a cable\ncompany, telephone companies, the hospital where her son was born, and even the library for unpaid\nfines and books which she concedes she was \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to return.  \nWhile I carefully considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (MC), I\nconclude MC   20(a)  does not apply as her financial problems have persisted and are not limited to\n10\na period \u201clong ago.\u201d  Neither are they \u201cinfrequent.\u201d  She still carries a significant amount of\noutstanding delinquent debts for a variety of bills incurred over several years. Applicant has only paid\none small debt and one larger debt out of the ten she acknowledged.  \nNeither does 20 (c)  apply.  Although Applicant contacted a credit counseling agency to help\n11\nresolve her credit problems after she got the SOR, she did not work out any arrangements with this\nagency to either challenge or resolve the debts listed on her credit report. While her plan is to pay a\nbill one by one, she does not have a timetable or a plan for how she will do so to resolve these\nsignificant delinquent debts which she admits have persisted since 1999.  \n\n  AG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\n12\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.   \nThe Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or\n13\notherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019\n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). In ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999), the Appeal Board\nspecifically addressed application of the statute of limitations, stating a \u201cperson who decides not to honor his or her debts\nmay be able to avoid paying those debts until they are legally uncollectible because the statute of limitations has run.\nReliance on the running of a statute of limitations would be a legally permissible course of action. However, it would\nnot demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s debts that would fall under the meaning of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 03-10880 (App. Bd. June 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 (App. Bd.\nMar. 27, 2003) (stating an applicant must do more than merely cite the statute of limitations to obtain the full benefit of\nFC MC 6). See also ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003) (\u201c[E]ven if a delinquent debt is legally\nunenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding\nan applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 98-0349 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 3, 1999) (even though an applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were not legally collectible because of the statute\nof limitations, that fact did not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the applicant\u2019s failure to resolve the\ndelinquent debts before the statute of limitations ran). Cf. ISCR Case No. 01-04425 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 17, 2002)\n(adverse Guideline F conclusions possible where applicant chose not to pay her delinquent debts, waited until her\ncreditors ceased trying to collect those delinquent debts, and they were eventually dropped from her credit report.).\n8\nShe did show that under MC 20(b)  there were conditions that resulted in financial problems\n12\nthat were largely beyond her control.  She had substantial responsibilities as a young woman when\nshe became a mother to two children as a teenager.  To her credit she has supported both children\nwithout any child support.  On the other hand, she has also chosen to support her boyfriend, who is\nthe father of her son and whom she has known for nine years, even though he has been unemployed\nfor seven years, so he has not worked to provide any income or support for his son.  Indeed, she\ntestified that one reason she could not pay the debts alleged in the SOR was that she had to pay one\nof his debts.  That conduct does not seem reasonable under the circumstances as there is no evidence\nthat he has a disability or any other reason for not working to contribute to the family income. \nFinally, the Applicant has only begun to take the first steps on the path to show a good-faith\neffort to resolve these debts as only two out of ten have been paid.  So 20.d., the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, is applicable only in part to\ntwo allegations, 1.a. and 1.c. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the financial\nconsiderations concern or evidence of a good faith effort to repay debt. She entered into a payment\nplan with one creditor in February 2005 with post-dated checks and then documented she paid off the\ndebt in March 2007, but did not explain how she found those resources on her limited income.\nOverall she failed to establish that she has changed her financial practices and now makes timely all\nher payments.   \n13\nNeither did she not establish that she had challenged any of the remaining debts even though\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n14\n9\nshe was not certain about the status of some of the debts, such as to a county fire department.  Neither\ndid she provide any evidence she returned the overdue books to the library as she had testified she\nplanned to do to mitigate concerns over a large library debt.  While some debts might be barred by\na state statute of limitations, she provided no evidence that any of them fell within that statute.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant's\ntrustworthiness. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial\nobligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raises serious trustworthiness concerns.\nShe is 26 years old and now sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct. Although in\na relationship for nine years, she has chosen to assume full responsibility for all household living\nexpenses for  her and his debts.. Given her limited income, she had to make choices about how to use\nher limited resources. She does pay her living expenses; however, she did not establish she pays those\ndebts  timely.  While in 2006 she sought help to resolve her debt through credit counseling, she did\nnot pursue that  avenue. Neither has she demonstrated that she has a budget and lives within it.  She\nfailed to provide strong evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and self-discipline in\nregards to her finances. While she has been steadily employed for the last two years and is favorably\nregarded at work, that positive record is insufficient to establish a case in mitigating in light of her\nslowness or inability to resolve the majority of her long-standing debts. \nIn sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is probable given her limited resources.  Financial\nconcerns remain as Applicant has only stated an intent to resolve her delinquent debts, but  failed to\ndevelop or present a timetable for a payment plan.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person,   I conclude she\n14\nhas failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive:\nSOR1 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) on \nJune 12, 2005. On May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns \nunder the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct adjudicative guidelines. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nPersonnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n1 \n \nApril 7, 2009\n\n2 \n \n \nOn June 20, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing.

(Item 4; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant is a high school graduate. She has been married since 1991 and \nemployed as a pharmacy technician since 1991. Applicant\u2019s husband works as a \ncarpenter. He is an alcoholic. Applicant and her husband have been separated and \nreconciled many times during their marriage. In March 2008, Applicant reported that her \nhusband had injured his hand at work in July 2007.  As a result, he was unemployed \nand collecting Workman\u2019s Compensation. The injury required three surgeries.  (Item 4; \nItem 5; Item 6.)  \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. In March 2003, Applicant and \nher husband petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. They agreed to make \npayments of $400 per month to the bankruptcy trustee. They made approximately three \npayments before concluding they could not afford to continue. The Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy was dismissed before confirmation. (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Item 6; Item 7.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that she owed approximately \n$189,346 in delinquent debt to 21 creditors. Twelve of the debts are delinquencies \narising between 2000 and 2003.  Three additional debts were placed in collection status \nin 2001, 2005, and 2006. Two additional debts were place in charged-off status in 2001 \nand 2002. Moreover, Applicant is responsible for two judgments, entered against her in \n2001 and 2002, a home foreclosure in 2002, and a state tax lien, filed in January 2006. \n(Item 1.) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nIn an interview with an authorized investigator, Applicant said her husband \nhandled the family\u2019s finances and was responsible for paying their bills.  She attributed \nthe foreclosure and her many financial delinquencies to her husband\u2019s alcoholism, \nunstable work habits, and financial irresponsibility. She stated that her husband \nneglected to timely file their state and federal income taxes, which resulted in tax liens. \nShe provided a copy of her earning statement for December 2007 showing a bi-weekly \nwage garnishment of $105 in favor of the federal government for unpaid federal taxes.  \n(Item 1; Item 5 at 12; Item 6 at 4.)  \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated she had an agreement \nwith the Internal Revenue Service to satisfy delinquent federal taxes. In her answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated that she planned to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection at \nsome unspecified time.  (Item 2; Item 5.)   \n \n \nApplicant executed a SF-85P on June 12, 2005. In response to Question 22a on \nthe SF-85P, she reported her 2003 Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing.  Question 22b on the \nSF-85P reads: \u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial \nobligation? Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal \nGovernment.\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 22b. The SOR alleged that \nApplicant deliberately falsified the SF-85P by failing to report 18 financial delinquencies, \nwhich remained unresolved as of January 7, 2008. (Item 4.) \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR Applicant stated that she did not understand Question \n22b.  She stated that she thought the question referred to monthly household bills.  \n(Item 2.) \n \n \nIn an interview with an authorized investigator in July 2007, Applicant reported \nthat her net monthly income was $2,389 and her husband\u2019s net monthly income was $2, \n320, for a total net monthly household income of $4,709.  She listed her monthly fixed \nexpenses as follows: rent: $1,015; groceries: $643; clothing: $100; utilities: $308; car \nexpenses: $229; medical expenses: $25; and miscellaneous expenses: $250. She \nreported one monthly household debt, an automobile loan of $1,000.  She stated she \npaid $250 a month on the auto loan. She reported as assets two vehicles valued at \n$2,000.  Her monthly remainder was $1,899. (Item 6 at 6.) \n  \nNothing in the record suggests that Applicant has pursued or received financial \ncredit counseling. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \n\n4 \n \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated considerable delinquent debt and \nwas unable or unwilling to pay her financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the \ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ Applicant=s financial delinquencies arose in about 2000 and 2001. In 2002, \nher home went into foreclosure, and she continued to accumulate debt. In 2006, a tax \nlien was filed against her by her state of residence. As of January 7, 2008, Applicant \nhad failed to pay or settle the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. \n \n  While Applicant\u2019s financially delinquent behavior began several years ago, it \ncontinues unresolved at the present time, is likely to recur, and casts doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  Accordingly, I conclude that AG \n\u00b620(a) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose in 2000 and 2001 and have continued for the past \neight years. Her husband, a carpenter, is an alcoholic and has been frequently \nunemployed, most recently after an injury to his hand in 2007. He has been \nirresponsible in handling the family finances. During a substantial part of the time she \nhad financial delinquencies, Applicant was steadily employed. While her husband\u2019s \nalcoholism, unemployment, and financial irresponsibility might have been beyond \n\n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s control, she offered no explanation for her failure to contact her creditors \nand to resolve or settle her financial delinquencies over a period of many years. I \nconclude that she failed to act responsibly in identifying and resolving her substantial \ndebts. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies only in part as a factor for consideration in this \ncase.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling. Even though \nshe had a monthly net remainder, she failed to use those resources to pay her \ndelinquent debt. Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 20 (c) does not apply to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. Because she has not made good-faith efforts to pay or resolve her \ndelinquent debts, AG \u00b620 (d) does not apply to the facts of her case.  AG 20(e) is also \ninapplicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and signed her SF-85P in June 2005, she responded \n\u201cno\u201d to a question asking if she was 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial \nobligation. The SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s response to the financial question on her \nSF-85P showed she had deliberately falsified material facts by failing to admit and \ndisclose numerous delinquent debts.  Applicant stated she misunderstood the question \nand thought it related to her monthly household obligations.  \n \nThis information raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), which reads as \nfollows: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d  AG \u00b617(a).     \n \n\n7 \n \nApplicant did not make good-faith efforts to correct the omissions before being \nconfronted with the facts. She denied her answer constituted deliberate falsification, and \nshe offered no explanation for her failure to acknowledge or report on her SF-85P long-\nstanding financial delinquencies that totaled over $189,000. \n \nApplicant was aware of her financial problems in 2003 when she and her \nhusband filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. She was also aware of their inability \nafter about four months to pay $400 each month to the bankruptcy trustee, resulting in \nthe dismissal of their Chapter 13 petition in September 2003. Based on her on-going \nfinancial problems, she knew of her delinquent debts when she executed her SF-85P in \nJune 2005. I conclude that her falsification in response to Question 20b was deliberate.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s husband is an alcoholic, \nfrequently unemployed, and irresponsible with money. Applicant has lived with this \nsituation for many years. She has been steadily employed since 1991. However, \ndespite her own steady income and a monthly remainder, she failed to budget her \nresources to satisfy her many delinquent debts, which now total over $189,000.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt is substantial and on-going. She has not sought \nfinancial counseling, and she provided no evidence that she understood the \nseriousness of her financial vulnerability or how to repair it. She provided no evidence \nthat she knew how to avoid financial difficulties in the future.  She provided no evidence \nthat she had taken any action to pay even the smallest of her delinquent debts. \n \nApplicant may find it beneficial to seek professional financial counseling and legal \nadvice about resolving her debts and acquiring financial stability in the near term.  She \n\n8 \n \ncan reapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this decision becomes \nfinal.  If she wishes, she can produce new evidence that addresses the Government\u2019s \ncurrent security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n                      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.v:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which includes a delinquent student loan. She\ndid not present sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial considerations concern. Eligibility is\ndenied. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) reviewed Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\noccupy an information systems position designated as an ADP I, II, or III position to support a\ncontract with the Defense Department. As a result of the review, the agency recommended\nApplicant\u2019s case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether Applicant is\neligible to occupy such a position. Acting under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on August 28,\n2006. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014detailed the factual basis for\nthe action and alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations.\nApplicant  answered the SOR on November 20, 2006, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me January 16, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling\nthe case for March 6, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript March 28, 2006. \nI left the record open until March 16, 2007, to allow Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentary evidence. She did so, and those matters were forwarded to me by department counsel\nwho voiced no objections to the post-hearing exhibits, which are admitted as follows: (1) Exhibit\nC\u2013Applicant\u2019s e-mail, dated March 15, 2007; (2) Exhibit D\u2013credit card statements from 1999\u20132000;\n(3) Exhibit E\u2013department store credit card statements from 1999\u20132000; (4) Exhibit F\u2013charge card\nstatements from 2000-2001; (5) Exhibit G\u2013college student loan account statements; (6) Exhibit\nH\u2013employee awards, recognitions, and an evaluation; (7) Exhibit I\u2013auto credit letter and lien release;\nand (8) Exhibit J\u2013federal student loan documents. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent indebtedness alleged in\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. I make the\nfollowing findings of fact set forth below in numbered paragraphs. \n1.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old customer-service representative for a company that provides\nhealth-care services to the Defense Department. She has worked for this company since March 2005.\nShe started as an appointment specialist and was promoted to her current position. The performance\nof her work duties has been good (Exhibit H). She currently earns $10.54 per hour. She married in\nSeptember 2004, but has been separated for about the last two years. She is uncertain of her\nhusband\u2019s whereabouts. She has no children. She lives with her mother and they share living\nexpenses. In conjunction with her employment, she completed a public-trust position application in\nApril 2005 (Exhibit 1). \n\n3\n2.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, as evidenced by delinquent debts reflected in\ncredit reports (Exhibits 2 and 3). The SOR alleges that she has ten delinquent debts for more than\n$16,000 in total. In summary, Applicant does not dispute that the debts are hers, she agrees that she\nowes the debts, and that they are currently unpaid (R. 26). Each debt is briefly discussed below.\n3.\nSOR subparagraph 1.a concerns a $89 collection account. This debt stems from a bank\nchecking account. This debt is unpaid.\n4.\nSOR subparagraph 1.b concerns a $84 collection account. This debt stems from a bank\nchecking account. It is unpaid. \n5.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c concerns a $945 collection account. This debt stems from a telephone\naccount. It is unpaid.\n6.\nSOR subparagraph 1.d concerns a $1,117 charged-off account. This debt stems from a credit\ncard account. Applicant believes this debt is a combination of two accounts from the same credit\ncard company (R. 31\u201332). It is unpaid. \n7.\nSOR subparagraph 1.e concerns a $462 collection account. This debt stems from a\ndepartment store credit card. Applicant made payments on this account in the past (Exhibit E). It is\nunpaid.\n8.\nSOR subparagraph 1.f is a $1,383 collection account. This debt stems from a charge card\naccount. Applicant made payments on this account in the past (Exhibit F). It is unpaid.\n9.\nSOR subparagraph 1.g is a $5,100 collection account. Applicant is uncertain of the origin of\nthis debt (R. 34\u201335). It is unpaid.\n10.\nSOR subparagraph 1.h is a $353 collection account. This debt stems from a utility or\nelectrical bill. It is unpaid.  \n11.\nSOR subparagraph 1.i is a $1,794 collection account. This debt stems from a credit card\naccount. Applicant made payments on this account in the past (Exhibit D). It is unpaid. \n12.\nSOR subparagraph 1.j is a $5,514 collection account. This debt stems from a student loan\nApplicant obtained from an educational institution. It was placed for collection in about July 2002\n(Exhibit 2 at 2). Applicant presented several documents on this student loan account (Exhibit G). As\nof November 1, 2002, she owed a total of $5,582 with a payment of $242.28 due (Exhibit G at 1).\nBy 2005, the balance had increased to more than $6,000 and she was making  $50 payments on the\naccount to a collection agency (Exhibit G at 2\u20135). By February 2006, the collection agency was\nattempting to collect the balance of $6,388 in full (Exhibit G at 7). Documents from two other\ncollection agencies indicate the balance had increased to about $10,000 or more by August 2006\n(Exhibit G at 8\u201310). But the documents refer to different balances due and different file and account\nnumbers. Therefore, I do not rely on this information, and find that Applicant owed approximately\n$6,388 on this student loan as of February 2006. It remains delinquent and Applicant is not making\npayments on this loan.\n\n See Memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security,\n1\ndated November 19, 2004, Subject: Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases. \n ADP Case No. 03-21205, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 289 (App. Bd. Dec. 23, 2005).\n2\n4\n13.\nIn addition to the student loan in subparagraph 1.j, Applicant has obtained federal  student\nloans in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2006 (Exhibit J at 3). The loans from 1994, 1995, 1996,\n1997, and 1999 do not have outstanding balances. The two loans from 2006 have outstanding\nbalances. One loan from 2006 has a balance of $1,650, and payments are set to begin in June 2007\n(Exhibit A). The other loan from 2006, which appears to be a consolidation loan, has a total balance\nof about $20,978 (Exhibit B). Applicant made an installment payment in September 2006 for $34.15.\nThe payment was on time and in full. She was scheduled to make another installment payment of\n$172.49 on March 17, 2007. This loan is in good standing as there is no amount past due and late\nfees have not been assessed to date.\n14.\nIn addition to the debts discussed above, Applicant has paid other financial obligations. For\nexample, she took a car loan for $8,640 in 2000 and paid it off in full as of October 2005 (Exhibit\nI). She now has another car and is making loan payments of $274 per month, and the loan is current.\nShe is current with her car insurance and she also pays for her mother\u2019s car insurance. She does not\nhave a checking account or savings account. She cashes her check at pay day and pays her bills with\nmoney orders or cash.  \n15.\nOther than making payments on student loans and her current living expenses, Applicant does\nnot believe it is feasible for her to make payments on the debts in the SOR (R. 25). She intends to\npursue bankruptcy and has saved about $1,100 for legal fees so she can start the process. She\nunderstands that the bankruptcy attorney has recommended that she pursue a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\n(50\u201351). She would like to divorce her husband, but does not currently have the money to pay for\nit. Applicant traces her financial problems to 1999 when her parents separated and eventually\ndivorced. Applicant detailed the various troubles and chain-of-events in her response to the SOR and\nthose matters are incorporated herein by reference. Due to these circumstances, Applicant has\nstruggled with her finances for many years. She acknowledged her responsibility for her debts and\nshe has been forthcoming with her employer about her financial problems. \nPOLICIES\nThis case involves an adjudication of Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP position, not\nan adjudication of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. There is some uncertainty\nregarding the rules that apply to ADP cases. In 2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security directed DOHA to utilize Defense Department Directive 5220.6\nto resolve contractor cases forwarded to it for a trustworthiness determination, to include those cases\ninvolving ADP I, II, and III positions.  But in 2005, the DOHA Appeal Board stated that in deciding\n1\nADP cases, we follow the procedures contained in the Directive, and we apply the adjudicative\nguidelines contained in Department of Defense Regulation 5200-2.R, dated January 1987.   Both the\n2\nDirective and the Regulation set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nassociated with each guideline. Concerning any differences between the Directive and the\nRegulation, I note that the provisions of each under Guideline F are substantially the same.\n\n5\nTherefore, I elect not to decide this legal issue because any differences in the guidelines would not\nhave a material effect on the outcome of the case. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F, a concern typically exists for two different types of\nsituations\u2014significant unpaid debts or unexplained affluence. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding sensitive\ninformation.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a concern is raised by significant unpaid debts\nand a history of not meeting financial obligations, of which there is ample evidence. Indeed,\nApplicant does not dispute that she has more than $16,000 in delinquent debt, to include a student\nloan. These circumstances raise a bonafide concern about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to occupy an\ninformation systems position designated as an ADP I, II, or III position. \nI reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) under the guideline and conclude she receives\nsome credit in mitigation. Each MC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014the behavior was not recent\u2014does not apply. Her financial problems are\nongoing and not in the distant past.   \nThe second MC\u2014it was an isolated incident\u2014does not apply. The record evidence shows\nmultiple unpaid debts, establishing a pattern of Applicant not meeting her financial obligations.   \nThe third MC\u2014the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014applies in her favor. As detailed in her response to the SOR, her parents\u2019 separation and\ndivorce that resulted in her helping her mother, her father\u2019s health problem, and her separation are\nall circumstances largely beyond her control that had a negative effect on her overall financial\nsituation.  \nThe fourth MC\u2014the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u2014does not apply.\nApplicant has not received counseling from a trained financial or credit counselor, nor are there signs\nthat her financial problems are resolved or under control. \nThe fifth MC\u2014the affluence resulted from a legal source\u2014is not applicable here.\nThe sixth MC\u2014the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u2014does not apply. All the debts in the SOR remain delinquent and\noutstanding. Although she has made efforts to pay her financial obligations in the past (for example,\nthe car loan in 2005), her efforts, when viewed in light of all the facts and circumstances, are not\nsufficient to qualify within the meaning of the MC. Her efforts, while laudable, are not enough to\nshow a substantial improvement to her overall financial situation. \n\n6\nI have also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept. Applicant is 31 years\nold and mature enough to make prudent decisions about her personal finances. She has a history of\nfinancial problems that includes circumstances largely beyond her control that contributed to her\nfinancial problems. Concerning the indebtedness in the SOR, she concedes that it is not feasible for\nher to make payments. She is pursuing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to obtain relief from her consumer\ndebt (students loans can not be discharged in bankruptcy), but she has just been able to save the\nmoney for the legal fees and is yet to file a case in bankruptcy court. The delinquent student loan in\nSOR subparagraph 1.j is most troubling because it is an obligation that should have a high priority\nfor Applicant to repay. In addition, Applicant has two other student loans. Payments on these loans\nwill stretch her limited means even thinner, which suggests that her financial problems are likely to\ncontinue or recur. \nAfter weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude Applicant has not\novercome the trustworthiness concern. She has shown that she is a good and decent person who is\ntrying to do the right thing. But her history of financial problems, coupled with her precarious current\nfinancial situation, militate against a favorable decision. Although I believe she is serious about\nresolving her financial problems, she has not, at this time, provided sufficient information to mitigate\nthe financial considerations concern. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not established that it\nis in the interests of national security to grant her eligibility for an ADP I, II, or III position.   \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR Paragraph 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013j:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I, II, or III position.\nEligibility is denied.   \nMichael H.

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThis 49 -year-old software engineer committed three crimes (two drug-related, in 1994\nand 2004 and one for spousal abuse in 1994.  He also knowing omitted any mention of the\n\n2\n1994 drug arrest in his 2003/2004 security clearance application, in violation of 10 U.S.C.\n1001, a felony.  Mitigation has not been adequately established.  Clearance is  denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The\nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nrequired under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, denied or revoked.\nOn November 2, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nand elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me December 15, 2006. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 8,\n2007. The hearing was conducted on February 16, 2007.  The Government introduced  nine\nexhibits (GX) 1-9 and one timely submitted post hearing exhibit (GX 10).  Applicant testified\nand introduced 16 exhibits (AX) A - P).  The transcript was received at DOHA on February\n27, 2007.   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The February 24, 2005\nSOR contains four (4) allegations under Guideline J and two (2) allegations under Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct).  Applicant admits the basic fact of allegations 1.a.- 1,d, but adds\nexplanations.  Only the specific admissions are accepted as such and deemed to be findings\nof fact.  He denies allegation 2.a.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional\nFINDINGS OF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n1.a. - Applicant was arrested on or about June 2, 1994, in State A, and charged with\nbeing \u201cUnder the Influence of a Controlled Substance.\u201d  His criminal proceedings were\nsuspended for one year and he was granted diversion.  When he had successfully completed\nthe diversion program, the charge against him was dismissed.  Applicant explains the\nproblem as arising during a \u201cparticularly bitter divorce\u201d (Response). \n\n3\n1.b. - Applicant was arrested on or about September 29, 1994, in State A, and charged\nwith (1) Inflict Injury/Spouse; (2) Inflict Corporal Injury; and (3) Battery.  The criminal\nproceedings were suspended for one year, he was granted diversion, and he was required to\nperform 20 hours of volunteer service.  Applicant views his wife as the instigator of the\nsituation leading to his arrest.\n1.c. - Applicant was arrested on or about July 27, 2004, in State A, and charged with\nPossession of a Controlled Narcotic Substance (Cocaine/Base Rock).  He was observed by\nundercover officers buying rock cocaine. The criminal proceedings were suspended for six\nmonths, he was granted drug diversion, ordered to participate in substance abuse classes for\nsix months, to participate in random drug testing, and to pay a $500 fee.  He was also issued\na Restraining Order to stay away from the drug dealer. On or about February 3, 2005, the\ncharge was dismissed.  Applicant admits the incident and he has \u201cno excuse for [his] actions\u201d\n(Id.).     \n1.d. - The falsification alleged in 2.b., below, constitutes a violation of 18 U.S.C.\n1001, a felony.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n2.a. - Applicant falsified material facts on his security clearance application (SF 86),\ndated July 30, 2003, and resigned by him on July 2, 2004, his response to the following\nquestion: \u201c24. Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses  For this item, report\ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise\nstricken from the court record.  [The only exception is not applicable under the facts of this\ncase].  Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or\ndrugs,\u201d to which he answered \u201cNo,\u201d and intentionally failed to disclose his 1994 drug use,\nas alleged in 1.a., above. \nPOLICIES\n \nEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination\nbased upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate: (1) Nature and\nseriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) Frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (3) Age of the applicant. (4) Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences involved; (5) Absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) Probability that\nthe circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive\n5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the\nultimate question of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an\nindividual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in\n\n4\nspecific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific\nallegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the\nGovernment has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the\nStatement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden\nof persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within\nspecific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive\n5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a 49-year-old software engineer. \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nThe three criminal offenses that led to his arrest occurred in June and September 1994\nand lastly, in July 2004.  The June 1994 arrest (SOR 1.a.) involved Applicant\u2019s use of a\nControlled Substance (GX 3 and GX 4).  The case was dismissed after Applicant successfully\ncompleted a diversion program (GX 4).  This arrest is now some 13 years old.  The July 2004\narrest involved his purchase of rock cocaine, which was admitted by Applicant and observed\nby undercover police officers (Response, GX 3).  The circumstance of the 2004  arrest  is\ndiscussed by Applicant in considerable detail in his sworn statement (GX 2).  This arrest\nshows incredibly poor judgment on his part in buying drugs from a person he did not know\non behalf of individuals he did not know (Tr at 41-44). \nOther adverse factors relating to the 2004 arrest are (1) it came after he first signed\nthe security clearance application in 2003; (2) there is now evidence of Applicant\u2019s using\nillegal drugs, \u201cfrom high school to 1989\" (\u201crarely, because he was in the military at the\ntime\u201d), including attending the U.S. Air Force Academy from 1975-1979) (Tr at 35), and\nagain in 1993-1994 (about a gram a week), while he working for his present employer, a\ndefense contractor (GX 1).  In the context of the entire record, it is impossible to conclude\nthat the incidents cited in the SOR are the only times Applicant has possessed, used, and/or\npurchased illegal drugs.  In addition, the 1994 arrest occurred when Applicant possessed a\nDoD  security clearance (Tr at 36-38).  \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s documentation.  One letter, from a \u201crecovery\ncenter\u201d dated April 4,1995, cites his successful completion of the program and his discharge\non November 14, 1994.  The letter expresses the Center\u2019s hope that Applicant would learn\nfrom his mistake and avoid involvement with illegal drugs in the future (AX A).  It is clear\n\n5\nhe did not do so.  The record makes it impossible to conclude with any level of confidence\nthat Applicant\u2019s drug involvement is unlikely to happen again. To the contrary, I conclude\nthat Applicant\u2019s drug use/involvement remains current.\nThe second 1994 arrest (SOR 1.b.) involved spousal abuse (AX DAX E, AX F, AX\nG).  While Applicant claims the charges were false, and contrived by his angry wife (Tr at\n56-59), the arrest is supported by the police report citing \u201cred marks\u201d on the wife\u2019s arms, and\nno apparent injury to Applicant (GX 6 and AX B), and is not refuted by contrary evidenc.\nI have also carefully considered Applicant\u2019s letters of recommendation (AX H - AX\nJ) and work evaluations (AX K and AX P).  It is obvious that he is viewed as an asset to his\ncompany, but none of the documents address or mitigate the concerns expressed in the SOR.\nThe Concern: A history of criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. \nDisqualifying Conditions: (1) any criminal activity, regardless of whether the\nindividual was actually charged; and (2) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nMitigating Conditions: None that are established by the record.  \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nApplicant admits he knew about the September 1994 arrest, but did not report it (Tr\nat 62-64).  His explanation is basically that his attorney told him that he could properly say\nthat he had never been convicted since he had successfully completed a diversion program.\nHowever, the  language of Question 24 was explicitly designed to cover this situation: \u201cFor\nthis item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed\nor otherwise stricken from the court record.  The single exception [involving a Federal drug\nstatute, is clearly not applicable  in this case].\u201d  Applicant read this question and answered\n\u201cNo\u201d without any explanation.  In his testimony, he did not provide any basis for concluding\nthat he had innocently misconstrued or misinterpreted the operative language of Question\n24.  His explanation lacks any support in the record and is simply not credible.        \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nDisqualifying Condition: (2). The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire [SF 86], personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nMitigating Conditions: None that are supported by the record; e.g., (2). The\nfalsification  remains recent, and the individual did not subsequently provide correct\ninformation voluntarily; or  (3). The individual did not make a prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect  the falsifications before being confronted with the facts.\n\n6\nOverall, the record evidence establishes that Applicant committed the crimes alleged\nin the SOR and that he knew and had reason to know that his answer to Question 24 was\nfalse. Looking at Applicant in the context of the whole person concept, he has simply not\ncome close to overcoming the evidence supporting the Government\u2019s concerns, as stated in\nthe SOR.  It is basic to the security clearance adjudication process that the ultimate burden\nof proof is on the Applicant  to demonstrate that he is eligible to possess a security clearance,\nas he did in the past.  The record compels the conclusion that he has simply not demonstrated\nhe currently possesses the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone\nseeking access to the nation\u2019s secrets.\n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive\nare hereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.\n            \nAgainst the Applicant\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

As required by Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Jan.\n1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 14, 2006.\nIt detailed the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 30, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 18, 2007. With the consent\nof the parties, I convened a hearing on March 20, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP\nI/II/III position. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 32 years old and has worked as a health care finder for a medical contractor for\nthe federal government for approximately 18 months. He married in 1999, and has been separated\nfrom his wife since April 2004. He has one biological child and a stepchild. He pays child support\nof $396 a month through garnishment. Applicant completed the 10  grade and then earned his\nth\nGeneral Equivalency Diploma. He has approximately two years of college credits. \nApplicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he owed all of the debts listed.  He wanted\n1\nto wait until he consolidated his debts before he started making any payments.  He stated that the\n2\ndebts were those of his wife and his mother and he was the joint account holder. He stated none of\nthe debts were actually incurred by him. However, he also stated that he did receive letters from\ncreditors, many for debts that had been forwarded to collection companies, requesting payment on\nthe debts and offering settlement agreements. He was not sure about the offers and did not know\nwhether they were legitimate so he did not respond or contact them.  He did not know who some of\n3\nthe creditors were, but made no attempt to respond to their letters or contact them on his own.4\nApplicant stated the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c was an account in his name that he let his mother use\nand he thought she was paying the account. He has not received reimbursement from his mother to\nresolve the debt.  The account in SOR \u00b6 1.f, is for a vehicle he and his wife purchased jointly. When\n5\n\nTr. 43-46.\n6\nTr. 46-47.\n7\nTr. 42.\n8\nTr. 39\n9\nTr. 38.\n10\nTr. 22-25; Answer; A copy of the service agreement was provided. Applicant stated the date on the agreement\n11\nis incorrect and should reflect January 5, 2007, and not 2006.\nTr. 50.\n12\nId.; No documentation was provided to verify if letters were sent and to which creditors.\n13\nTr. 51-52.\n14\nTr. 52-60.\n15\n4\nthey separated, she was to make the payments.  She defaulted on the debt and the vehicle was\n6\nrepossessed. He stated he did not know she was not making the payments. However, he did\nacknowledge that he was aware the vehicle was repossessed, but stated it was not until sometime\nlater.  \n7\nThe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e is for medical services that Applicant stated should have been\npaid by his insurance. He has not followed up with the insurance company to resolve this debt.  The\n8\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was for telephone services that was sent to collection in August 2000. Applicant\nstated this was his wife\u2019s debt.  This debt went to collection while Applicant was still living with his\n9\nwife and he concurs that the account was in his name. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d and 1.g are all\ncredit card debts. Applicant has not made any payments on any of his debts.  \n10\nIn January 2007 Applicant entered an agreement with a credit counseling service to\nconsolidate his debt.  Prior to then he had not taken any action on his delinquent debts.  He owes\n11\n12\ncredit counseling service a fee to start the service. He expects he will complete payment to the\nservice later in the month. He has not completed paying the fee. He stated the service has sent letters\nto creditors in an attempt to verify the debts and potentially seek a settlement.  No documentation\n13\nwas presented to confirm that any action by the service has been taken. Applicant has not contacted\nany of the creditors on his own because he was hoping to consolidate his debt. This has not yet been\naccomplished. \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on October 10,\n2005. In response to Question 22b which inquired whether he was now 180 days delinquent on any\nloan or financial obligation, he answered \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a in his answer. At his\nhearing, he first admitted he was aware of his delinquent debts.  Later he contradicted his answer\n14\nand stated he was unaware he had any debts over 180 days delinquent when he filled out the SF\n85P.  Applicant stated all the debts were his wife\u2019s or his mother\u2019s and he believed they had been\n15\n\nTr. 57-60.\n16\nTr. 59.\n17\nTr. 92.\n18\nGE 4 p. 3.\n19\nTr. 91.\n20\nTr. 65-66.\n21\nTr. 66-68.\n22\n5\nmaking all the payments so he did not believe he had any delinquent debt.  Applicant admitted to\n16\nreceiving offers from collection companies regarding delinquent debt, but stated he did not know\n\u201cwhether to trust them or not.\u201d  Applicant later testified \u201cThere was doubt in my mind, but I wasn\u2019t\n17\nguaranteed for a fact\u201d that when he filled out his public trust questionnaire that he had debts over 180\ndays. Later, again he testified he did not know he had debts over 180 days delinquent because his\nwife and mother were using his credit and he thought they were paying the bills.  I find Applicant\u2019s\n18\ntestimony inconsistent, unbelievable and not credible. He stated the debts were held jointly and at\nleast some of the debts went to collection while he was still living with his wife. He had joint\naccounts with his spouse, he allowed his mother to use his credit card, and he was aware a jointly\nheld vehicle had been repossessed. Claiming he did not trust letters received from collection agencies\nis not reasonable when he knew he had joints accounts and did nothing at the time to find out if these\nwere viable claims. It is not reasonable to believe he was totally unaware of any of his delinquent\ndebt or that he was not responsible for debts in his name. I find Applicant intentionally and\ndeliberately failed to list his delinquent debts. \nIn answers to interrogatories Applicant acknowledged he has minimal money left after paying\nexpenses and child support payments to resolve his debts.  Applicant stated \u201cas the man\u201d he would\n19\nput his name on accounts.  He also stated that if the debt was in his name he would take the\n20\ninitiative to resolve it. He did not provide any documentation to show debts were not in his name.\nApplicant stated he believed the Office of Personnel Management Investigator was going to provide\nhim advice on how to repay his debts and fix his credit. He was not told by the investigator that he\nwas a financial advisor, but instead told him the purpose of the interview.  It was merely Applicant\u2019s\n21\nimpression that the interviewer was trying to help him.22\nPOLICIES\n\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n23\nRegulation \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n24\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n25\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n26\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n27\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n28\nRegulation Appendix 8 at 132.\n29\n6\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out in the Regulation are used to make ADP trustworthiness\ndeterminations. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures\ncontained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.23\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n24\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n25\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions\n26\nof the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II, and including ADP III\npositions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and\nSecurity) dated November 19, 2004. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases. \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d27\nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the adjudicative procedures contained in\nthe Directive.28\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Each eligibility\n29\ndetermination  must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Regulation.\nSpecifically these are: the nature, extend, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of\nparticipation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition\nor factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd.

The government\n30\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n31\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n32\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n33\ndecision.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\n34\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n35\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n36\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n37\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n38\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F-Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\n\n8\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19 (a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19 (c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has delinquent debts starting in 1999 that he failed to pay.\nHe admitted he owes the debts and it remains delinquent.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20 (b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control), FC MC 20 (d) (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), FC MC 20 (e) (the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue).\nThe numerous debts remain unpaid so they are recent and not infrequent. Therefore, FC MC\n20 (a) does not apply. Applicant had credit cards and accounts that he held jointly with his wife. He\nis equally responsible for the debts that he cosigned for as a joint owner. He ignored the debts despite\nreceiving notices from creditors and collection agencies. On one hand he wants to say he was unaware\nthat the debts were delinquent, yet he was receiving notices as to their delinquency and claiming he\ndid not trust the notices. He and his wife are separated now, but were not separated when most of the\ndebt was incurred and later sent to collection. He did not act responsibly in contacting his wife,\nmother or the companies to inquire as to their validity. Instead he ignored the debts. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems are not the result of conditions that were beyond his control. He had ample\nopportunity to contact the creditors, at least as early as he became aware that the accounts went to\ncollection. His explanation that he did not trust the letters would only be plausible if he actually\ncontacted the companies that sent to the letters to confirm the information. I find FC MC 20 (b) does\nnot apply. \nApplicant recently contacted a credit counseling company to help consolidate his delinquent\ndebts. This action was taken  after he received the SOR. He is still making payments on the contract\nto this company to begin action, however, to date no actual plan has been initiated or payments made.\nAt this point it is too early to determine if Applicant has fulfilled his contractual commitment with\nthe agency or has made consistent payments toward his debt. I find although Applicant has entered\nan agreement it is premature to find there is clear indication that his problems are being resolved.\nTherefore, I find FC MC 20 (c) does not apply. At this juncture, Applicant has not made a good faith\neffort to resolve his debt. He has merely acknowledged his obligations. Hence, FC MC 20 (d) does\n\n9\nnot apply. His effort to contact a credit counseling agency came after he received the SOR and no\npayments have yet been made. Applicant admitted the debts in the SOR. He admitted he was the joint\nowner on the debts. He is equally responsible for the debts with his wife. He did not provide any\nevidence to show why he should not be held responsible. He admits he was \u201cthe man\u201d and put his\nname on the accounts. There is no evidence of fraud or deception, but rather a lack of responsibility\nin monitoring what he put his name on and his obligations with regard to it. I find FC MC 20 (e) does\nnot apply. \nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16 (a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies. Applicant intentionally failed to list his\ndelinquent debts on his public trust questionnaire. His explanations for failing to do so were not\nbelievable. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent testimony leads me to believe he was aware that he had\ndelinquent debts that were over 180 days. He knew he had joint accounts for credit cards with his wife\nand a vehicle that they owned jointly was repossessed. He gave his mother his credit card to use, but\nnever followed up on her paying the bill. It is obvious that he knew he had the debts, but felt he\nshould not have to pay for them even though he was the joint owner, because his wife incurred the\ncharges. However, he never provided anything to show that she was the only one with access to the\naccount or made charges. Applicant took on the obligation to repay debts that he held jointly. No\nevidence was presented to show the expenses incurred were exclusively his wife\u2019s or that he took his\nname off the account or that he never used the credit card. \nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC ) and especially\nconsidered PC MC 17 (a) (the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and PC MC 17 (e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation\nor duress). I find neither apply. Applicant did not promptly provide the correct information on his\nsecurity clearance. I find his testimony for his failure to answer the question on the trustworthiness\nquestionnaire was not believable and not credible. Applicant did not provide any evidence or\nreassurance that he has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation or duress. Despite the evidence presented, Applicant continued to deny he was aware\nhe had any delinquent debts over 180 days even when at least two of the debts were placed for\ncollection in 1999, 2000, and 2003, and the fact that he was receiving settlement offers from creditors.\nThe Whole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\n\n10\nI considered all of the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating the case. Applicant is\na young man who has significant debt. Most of the debt was incurred while he was living with his\nwife. He was the joint owner on credit cards and other accounts, but failed to follow-up on their\nstatus. He recently contracted with a credit counseling agency to consolidate his debt, but this\noccurred subsequently to receiving the SOR. He has not made any payments on his delinquent debts.\nApplicant was not credible in claiming he did not know he had delinquent debt. Therefore, I am\npersuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position. Accordingly, Guidelines F and E\nare decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position. Eligibility\nis denied.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn September 28, 2006 DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response to the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on October 27, 2006.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on December 7,\n2006.  A hearing was conducted on January 2, 2007. At the hearing, the Government offered seven\n(7) exhibits (Government\u2019s Exhibits (GX) 1-7).  Applicant testified and offered four (4) exhibits\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A-D).  Applicant also timely submitted seven (7)) post hearing exhibits\n(AX E1-E7).  The transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA on January 10, 2007.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The SOR contains four (4)\nallegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted\nallegations 1.a and 1.b., and denied 1.c. and 1.d.  All admissions are incorporated herein as Findings\nof Fact.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n1.a. - On or about September 17, 1976, Applicant was the subject of a Special Court Martial\nfor violating Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  He was found guilty and\nsentenced to a reduction in grade to Airman Basic, confined to hard labor for one month, and\nforfeited $150 per month for six months.\n\n3\n1.b. - On or about August 1982, in State A, Applicant was charged with battery.  As a result\nof this charge, he was required to attend anger management classes, after which the case was\ndismissed.\n1.c. - On or about January 30, 1994, a complaint for sexual battery was filed against\nApplicant.  Formal charges were not filed.\n1.d. - On or about October 21, 2002, in State A, Applicant was charged with Threaten\nCrime/Intimidate/Terrorize.  In about December 2003, he was allowed to plead guilty to\nMisdemeanor Stalking in about December 2003.  He was sentenced to 60- days in jail, placed on five\nyears probation, required to attend a violent offender treatment program, prohibited from any contact\nwith his ex-wife.  Applicant\u2019s personal weapons, seized by the police on October 21, 2002, were\nreturned to him by court order on December 23, 2002, citing the lack of evidence that such a return\nwould \u201cresult in endangerment to [Applicant] or others\u201d (AX E5).  \nPOLICIES\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nthe conduct, to include (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; knowing participation; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nthe voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on\npage 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching\nmy overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\n4\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a 50-year-old system engineer for a defense contractor.   \n1.a. - In 1975, at age 19, Applicant entered the Air Force and was granted a security clearance\n(Tr at 23).  In 1976, he responded to pressure from his \u201ctrainer,\u201d and agreed to a scheme to make\n\u201csome quick money,\u201d by making purchases at a local military exchange and then reselling the\nmerchandise (including a stereo) for a profit to non-authorized individuals (Tr at 20-23).  Applicant\nknew it \u201cwas illegal\u201d (Tr at 21).  When he left the Air Force after six years, he was given an\nHonorable Discharge and a Commendation Medal (Tr at 22).  Because of the youth and immaturity\nof Applicant at the time and the passage of some 30 years without similar misconduct, I conclude\nthis matter is no longer of security significance.\n1.b. - In 1982, he was married to a woman with whom he had a rocky relationship, including\narguments and some violence on both sides.  Applicant claims his wife attacked him with a butcher\nknife and cast iron skillet and he responded by hitting her (Tr at 24). She had some bruises on her\nbody and he did not, so he was arrested.  He attended anger management classes, and the charges\nwere ultimately dismissed (Id.). \n1.c. - In 1994, Applicant and his wife attended a Super Bowl party at a friend\u2019s house.  There\nwere some hard feelings between Applicant and his wife and another couple.  The next day,\nApplicant learned the other woman had complained that Applicant had touched her breasts and filed\na criminal complaint (GX 3).  Applicant reported the charges to his company, which submitted an\nAdverse Information Report (GX 7).  He denies any inappropriate contact with the woman (GX 3\nand Tr at 25).  There is no record of any formal charges being filed. \n1.d. - On or about October 21, 2002, Applicant was charged with Threaten Crime/Intimidate/\nTerrorize.  The record show this incident involves the woman to whom he was married from 1989\nto 1997.  Applicant claims that beginning in 1992, after birth of their second child, A, his wife\nsuffered from post partum depression and showed a change in personality, including verbally and\nphysically abusing him (GX 2).  He further claims that in about 1997, his wife was arrested for biting\nhim and made statements he construed as being threatening.  In 2002, she complained that Applicant\nhad placed three bullets in her mailbox. (GX 2 at 2).  Applicant claims that his daughter A told him\nwhat his wife had done (Ibid.), a claim his daughter corroborates (AX E7).  Applicant stated that he\nwas shown his daughter\u2019s diary before trial and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges to avoid any\nemotional damage to her by asking her to testify against her mother (Id. at 4).  Applicant claims he\naccepted the punishment imposed by the court to avoid having his daughter forced to testify that her\nmother had lied.  Applicant remains on  probation until December 2008.  Considering the unusual\nnature of the evidence, I have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s testimony, the court documents, and\ndocuments submitted by the daughter, which have been admitted into evidence (AX A, AX D, and\nAX E7). \nApplicant has clearly had a sometimes troubled past, mostly  in the context of his relationship\nwith his wives.  As to the two most recent incidents, 2002 and 2004, both involve his second (now\nex) wife and must be considered in the context of the failure of the marriage and the fight over\ncustody of their child (then 13 and now about 16).  That charges were made is clear, but it is not so\n\n5\nclear that the incidents actually occurred as alleged by the ex-wife.  In this context, I conclude that\nthe documents from Applicant\u2019s daughter are authentic, relevant and material.  These documents,\nalong with others and Applicant\u2019s testimony, suggest that most of Applicant\u2019s problems were\nsituational (occurring during bad marriages) and are not reflected in the bulk of his 50 -year life span.\nIn the last 25 years, Applicant\u2019s legal problems have both involved his ex-wife.  In the 1994\nincident, no formal charges were filed and Applicant\u2019s explanations, in the context of his marital\nproblems, are not countered by any other substantive evidence. His explanations are found to be\ncredible enough to overcome the conclusions urged by the Government, i.e., that Applicant\ncommitted a criminal act.\nAs to the 2002 matter, it is a fact that Applicant remains on probation until 2008.  However,\nthe bulk of the record, specifically (1) the circumstances of the alleged misconduct, (2) the lack of\nother recent problems, and (3) the otherwise praiseworthy life he has documented, make a strong\ncase that Applicant can be relied upon to work with and protect classified information and material.\nI note particularly his Air Force records (AX E2), and the letters and certificates of appreciation for\nhis long service in support of the national defense (AX E3, AX E4, and AX E6).  I have carefully\nconsidered the recent letter from his now 16 year old daughter (AX E7), and conclude that it supports\nhis version of the events surrounding 2002 events and his decision to plead guilty to Misdemeanor\nStalking.\nThe Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nDisqualifying Conditions: (1). Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged; and (2). A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nMitigating Conditions (MC): (1). Most of the criminal behavior was not recent; MC (2)\napplies in part, in that the pressures leading up to the conduct are no longer present in that person's\nlife; (5) The factors leading to the violation(s) are not likely to recur; and (6). The overall record\nindicates clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. \nIn summary, considering Applicant under the whole person concept, the totality of the\nevidence suggests that the problems shown by Applicant\u2019s past conduct are not likely to recur and\nthat he can be relied upon to safeguard classified information and material.   \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nFor the Applicant\n\n6\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. at 96; GE 1; GE 2 at 26-27, 33-34.\n2\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On November 3, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 7, 2006 and November 22, 2006, and elected\nto have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on March 6, 2006, scheduling the hearing for March 27, 2007. The\nhearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) on April 11, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE\nApplicant requested that his personal representative also testify as a witness. Department\nCounsel did not object. The personal representative testified before the Applicant testified.\nThe Government offered two exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and\n2. There was no objection to GE 1, and it was admitted. GE 2 is the report of investigation (ROI),\nconducted for Applicant\u2019s background investigation. Applicant was advised of his right under \u00b6\nE3.1.20 of the Directive to object to its admission. Applicant initially objected, but then decided to\nwaive his objection. Absent an objection, GE 2 was admitted. Applicant testified and offered nine\nexhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, and admitted without objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a high school graduate.\nHe has been divorced since 2002, and has no children.2\nApplicant came from a harsh background. Members of his family were involved in drugs and\ncriminal activity, and Applicant was abused. He started drinking and using drugs at a young age. He\nwas introduced to marijuana and cocaine by his mother, grandmother, aunt, and cousin. Applicant\n\nTr. at 46-47, 64-66, 73; GE 2 at 2.\n3\nTr. at 73-74; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 40.\n4\nTr. at 99, 103.\n5\nTr. at 35, 74-78; GE 2 at 6, 38-39.\n6\nTr. at 79.\n7\nTr. at 85.\n8\n4\nhad disciplinary issues in high school, but after devoting himself to football and track, he had no\nproblems for his last two years in school. Applicant\u2019s mother and half-sister have spent time in jail.\nApplicant has a good relationship with his younger brother, but has little dealings with his other\nfamily members.  \n3\nApplicant was arrested in 1995, for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), possession\nof cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia. He pled guilty to the DUI. He was ordered to pay\na fine of $600, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year, and he was required to complete\ntreatment with an alcohol safety program. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for an additional six\nmonths for his possession of a controlled substance.4\nApplicant continued to drink alcohol and use cocaine after his arrest. In about 1998, he\nstopped using cocaine, and has not used illegal drugs since. He has not been arrested since his 1995\narrest.5\nApplicant attended alcohol treatment for about seven days in 2002. His girlfriend did not\napprove of his drinking. Applicant sought counseling at least in part because of his girlfriend. He\nrequested his supervisor at work to help him get admitted, and was admitted as part of his Employee\nAssistance Plan. The treatment was four days of inpatient treatment and three days of outpatient\ntreatment. There is indication in the record that Applicant may have been diagnosed as alcohol\ndependent.  Applicant was unclear if he was ever diagnosed as alcohol dependent.\n6\nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Do you recall Dr. [----] diagnosing you as alcohol\ndependent?\nAPPLICANT:  Yes, I remember him saying that you\u2019re probably alcohol dependent.\nADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE:  Wait a minute. Say that again. What did he tell you?\nAPPLICANT: I think he said he presumably felt that I was probably alcohol\ndependent. He didn\u2019t diagnostically say that I was.  I can\u2019t remember off the top of\nmy head.7\nApplicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous for several months after he left treatment, but\nthen stopped and did not return.8\n\nTr. at 75, 83-85; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n9\nTr. at 35-37, 40-42, 47-48, 56-59; GE 2 at 15-17.\n10\nGE 2 at 10-12.\n11\nGE 2.\n12\nTr. at 35-36, 70-71, 75.\n13\n5\nApplicant\u2019s current alcohol consumption is a 12 or 22 ounce beer three or four nights a week,\nand occasionally one or two shots. Applicant believes he has only been drunk, or \u201coverindulging\u201d\non possibly two occasions since he left rehabilitation.  \n9\nThe supervisor that took Applicant to his treatment testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant\nlived with this witness for a few months in 2004. He knows of Applicant\u2019s background, and is aware\nthat Applicant still drinks alcohol, but he has only observed Applicant drink in moderation. He and\nApplicant would occasionally have a drink together, generally one or two beers, usually at the\nwitness\u2019 house while watching a sporting event. The last occasion was about two months ago. Their\nlack of contact is due to their extended work schedules. He has never seen Applicant drunk. He\ncontacted Applicant on several occasions in the middle of the night for work issues, and they met\nat work. He never observed any indications of alcohol impairment on any of the occasions.  \n10\nApplicant lived with his girlfriend for several years. She was interviewed by an investigator\nin 2006. She stated Applicant drank a beer every day, and believed he probably drank more on the\nweekends while watching football. She stated that Applicant had not been intoxicated since he\nattended treatment.11\nA number of other people, including Applicant\u2019s ex-wife, neighbors, friends, and co-workers\nwere also interviewed for Applicant\u2019s background investigation. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife was aware of\nApplicant\u2019s drug and alcohol history, but stated that drugs and alcohol did not lead to their break up.\nShe had no contact with Applicant in more than four years. No one else reported any incidents of\nApplicant being intoxicated or drunk.12\nApplicant currently works two jobs. He works full time at the defense contractor. He wakes\nup between 1:45 and 2:00 A.M., drives to a nearby town, and delivers newspapers. He finishes\nbetween 4:40 and 5:00 A.M., goes home and gets a couple hours sleep. He wakes up between 8:00\nand 8:30 A.M., and gets ready to go to work. His shift officially starts at 10:00 A.M. He arrives at\nwork between 9:00 and 10:00, and works until about 6:00 P.M. It takes about 30 to 45 minutes to\ndrive home. He is usually home by 7:00 P.M. He relaxes for a while. On some nights he will have\na 12 or 22-ounce beer. He falls asleep between 9:30 and 10:00 P.M.13\nApplicant has worked a number of jobs over the past several years, usually working two and\nsometimes three jobs. He worked for a limousine service as a driver on a part-time basis from about\n2002 to 2004. Applicant went to pick up his check on one occasion in 2004. He and several other\ndrivers did not receive checks. When he asked why he did not receive a check, Applicant was told\nit was because of damage to one of the cars. Applicant was upset because he did not believe he\ndamaged a car. He was working at a full time job, and one other part-time job, and did not continue\n\nTr. at 100-102; GE 1 at 15; GE 2 at 3, 21-23.\n14\nTr. at 86-92; GE 2 at 4.\n15\nGE 1 at 27.\n16\nId. at 27-28.\n17\nId. at 15.\n18\nId. at 29-30.\n19\n6\ndriving for the company. The supervisor at the limousine service had positive things to say about\nApplicant to the background investigator. He stated that Applicant had one conflict with a\ndispatcher, but stated that was not an uncommon occurrence in their business. He could not recall\nwhy Applicant left, but was sure he did not leave on bad terms, and was eligible for rehire.14\nIn late 2004 to early 2005, Applicant obtained a temporary job through a staffing agency.\nApplicant was employed by the staffing agency, but worked under contract for another company. He\nworked for about 60 days. The company considered hiring him to a full time position. The temporary\njob served as the trial basis for his hiring by the company. As part of the hiring process, the company\nconducted a background check. The background check revealed Applicant\u2019s 1995 arrest for DUI and\npossession of a controlled substance, and the company decided not to hire him. His temporary\ncontract for the company ended at that time.15\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), on\nAugust 25, 2005. Section 22 asked:\nHas any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years?\n1.\nFired from a job.\n2. \nQuit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired.\n3.\nLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct.\n4. \nLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory\nperformance.\n5.\nLeft a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.16\nApplicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and listed that he \u201c[l]eft a job by mutual agreement following allegations\nof misconduct,\u201d in 2002, for \u201cmisuse of email which by them it was called code of\nethics.\u201d Applicant did not list his employment with the limousine service in this section, but he did\n17\nlist it under Section 11, which asked for his employment activities.  He did not list his employment\n18\nwith the staffing agency, or the company he was contracted to by the staffing agency, under any\nsection. Applicant listed his DUI and possession of controlled substance arrest and his alcohol\ntreatment under other pertinent sections.19\n\nGE 2 at 1-8.\n20\nAE B, C, D.\n21\nAE C at 4.\n22\nAE A, F.\n23\nTr. at 38, 61.\n24\nTr. at 71-72.\n25\nDepartment of the Navy v.

He has received awards, and his performance evaluations have been excellent.21\nUnder \u201cAbsenteeism/Tardiness, one evaluation reported that he, \u201cis always in the office early, works\nweekends with vendors as to not inconvenience employees, and responds back to the building for\nemergencies.\u201d  Letters on his behalf describe him as hard-working, loyal, trustworthy,\n22\nconscientious, and thorough.  His witness believes Applicant is a good, honest person that he would\n23\ntrust to take care of his family if something happened to him.  Applicant also coaches football.\n24\n25\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n26\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n27\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n28\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n29\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n30\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n31\n8\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n31\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nThe potential Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) in this case are AC\nDC 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), AC DC 22(c)\n(habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), AC DC 22(d) (diagnosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of\nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence), and AC DC 22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program).\nAC DC 22(a) is applicable to Applicant\u2019s 1995 arrest and subsequent conviction for DUI.\nApplicant\u2019s currently consumes alcohol three to four days per week. This could be considered\nhabitual. However, there is no evidence that during this regular consumption, Applicant drinks to\nthe point of impaired judgment. I do not find AC DC 22(c). \nAC DC 22(d) requires a diagnosis of alcohol dependence or abuse by a duly qualified\nmedical professional. The evidence that Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent came from\nan ROI of the records from Applicant\u2019s alcohol treatment. It is impossible to tell how long the actual\nrecords are, but the ROI was one and a half pages. The ROI shows: \n\nGE 2 at 38.\n32\nThe previous version, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV),\n33\nwas copyrighted in 1994. I take administrative notice of the DSM-IV and the DSM-IV-TR.\nDSM-IV-TR at 213. It is also 303.90 in the DSM-IV. See page 195.\n34\nDSM-IV-TR at 3-4.\n35\nThe Appeal Board has held that an admission to the SOR does not necessarily end the discussion. See ISCR\n36\nCase No. 02-21087 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2005). \n9\nDIAGNOSIS \n303.91 - ALCOHOL DEPEND[E]NCE\nTREATMENT PRESCRIBED\nNOT SHOWN\nTREATMENT LOCATION SAME AS ABOVE\nPROGNOSIS\nNOT SHOWN\nHIS PHYSICIAN AT [****] WAS [----], MD.32\n\u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive holds an \u201cROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided\nit is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d There was no authenticating\nwitness, but Applicant did not object to its admission. Nonetheless there are problematic aspects of\nthe ROI. A diagnosis was listed, but the ROI did not state who made the diagnosis. An M.D. was\nlisted as Applicant\u2019s physician, but the ROI did not state that this doctor made the diagnosis. The\ndiagnosis was presumably made utilizing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental\nDisorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), copyrighted 2000.  The ROI lists alcohol\n33\ndependence as \u201c303.91.\u201d Alcohol dependence in the DSM-IV-TR is \u201c303.90.\u201d  The DSM-IV-TR\n34\nalso provides for a provisional diagnosis, which \u201ccan be used when there is a strong presumption that\nthe full criteria will be met for a disorder, but not enough information is available to make a firm\ndiagnosis.\u201d The diagnostic uncertainty can be indicated by recording \u201c(Provisional)\u201d following the\ndiagnosis.  I have also observed on other medical records, the use of the term, \u201cDiagnostic\n35\nImpression,\u201d when a complete diagnosis was not made. Without the treatment records, or an\nauthenticating witness, I am unable to ascertain with what degree of accuracy the treatment records\nwere transcribed. The incorrect transcription, \u201c303.91,\u201d leads me to believe that it was transcribed\nwrong by the investigator, or was written in the medical records either incorrectly, or by someone\nnot totally familiar with the DSM-IV-TR. None of these options provide me with any confidence of\nthe accuracy of the ROI, or the diagnosis. I considered that Applicant admitted to SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.c and\n1.d, which include that he received treatment \u201cfor a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Dependent.\u201d 36\nI also considered that at the hearing, Applicant denied knowing if he was diagnosed as alcohol\ndependent. I find that the Government has not met their initial burden of proving a diagnosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol\nabuse or alcohol dependence. I also do not find an evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\n\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03472 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2007). \n37\n10\nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram. I therefore do not find AC DC 22(d), AC DC 22(e), or AC DC 22(f) applicable.\nThere are three potential Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC DC) in this case,\nAC DC 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AC DC 23(b) (the individual acknowledges\nhis or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser)), and AC DC 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or\noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear\nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program).\nApplicant\u2019s DUI arrest was more than 11 years ago. He has not had any alcohol related\nincidents since. Other then his self-referral to an alcohol treatment program, there is nothing in the\nrecord that indicates Applicant currently has a problem with alcohol. While Applicant still consumes\nalcohol, all evidence points to responsible use. AC DC 23(a) is applicable. Applicant has established\na clear and established pattern of modified consumption and responsible use. AC DC 23(b) and AC\nDC 23(d) are partially applicable.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his e-QIP by not listing that his\nemployment with the limousine service ended under unfavorable circumstances, and by not listing\nthat he was terminated from the company that the staffing agency contracted him to after he failed\ntheir background check. \nAs discussed above, it is very questionable whether Applicant left the limousine service\n\u201cunder unfavorable circumstances.\u201d He simply stopped driving for the company. Applicant never\nactually worked for the company alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.(2). He worked for the staffing agency. I do\nnot find that he was terminated by the company, nor by the staffing agency. Even if it is assumed the\nanswers were incorrect, that is not dispositive of the issue of Applicant\u2019s falsification, since the mere\nproof of an omission or an incorrect answer, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission or incorrect response occurred.37\n\n11\nI observed Applicant during his testimony, and assessed his demeanor and credibility. I also\nconsidered that Applicant listed the employment with the limousine service elsewhere on the e-QIP.\nApplicant listed other information that was far more adverse than this information. He listed his DUI\nand possession of controlled substance arrest, his alcohol treatment, and his termination from a third\ncompany following allegations of misconduct. I do not find that Applicant intentionally provided\ninaccurate or incomplete answers on his e-QIP. It does not make sense that Applicant would attempt\nto hide that he was not hired by a company because he did not pass their background check, yet\nreveal that same criminal record on the e-QIP. No Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is\napplicable. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \nApplicant grew up in a hostile and dysfunctional family environment that included abuse,\ndrugs, alcohol, and criminal activities. He was introduced to drugs at an early age by family\nmembers, including those who should have been authority figures such as his mother, grandmother,\nand aunt. He turned to drugs and alcohol resulting in his arrest for DUI and possession of a\ncontrolled substance in 1995. He has not been arrested since then, and has not used illegal drugs\nsince at least 1998. When he thought that his drinking was becoming a problem, and upon suggestion\nby his girlfriend, Applicant entered an alcohol treatment program. Applicant currently drinks\nmoderately three to four days per week. I considered not only Applicant\u2019s testimony, but also the\ntestimony of his witness, and the interviews of people in the ROI, including Applicant\u2019s ex-\ngirlfriend. Applicant works long hours and two jobs. There was no indication in his background\ninvestigation that there is a current alcohol problem, or that alcohol has impacted Applicant\u2019s job\nperformance or attendance. I also considered the very favorable character evidence.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non his alcohol consumption and personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nEdward W. Loughran\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 16, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\n\nApplicant includes two character reference letters as attachments to his brief.  The Board may not consider new\n1\nevidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Accordingly, we may not consider Applicant\u2019s attachments, and they do\nnot demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\n2\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On May\n3, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased; whether the\nJudge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge was biased, essentially based upon the fact that the Judge\ndid not find Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence sufficient to mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was\nbiased or unfair.  Rather, the issue is whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in\na manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness and impartiality of the Judge.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2007).  Lack of partiality is not\ndemonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached unfavorable conclusions.\nId.  Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error,\nstanding alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudice.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  \nApplicant has not met the heavy burden of persuasion noted above, in that he fails to identify\nanything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to question\nthe fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).\n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge should have concluded, as a matter of law, that the\nsecurity concerns raised by his multiple falsifications were mitigated by Applicant\u2019s favorable\nevidence, particularly the fact that: (a) Applicant had admitted to his multiple falsifications and had\nsubsequently provided the correct information, and (b) Applicant had held a security clearance for\nnearly 30 years without a security violation, infraction, or incident.  As part of his argument,\nApplicant notes that the text of the Judge\u2019s decision did not mention his years of dedicated service\nand his outstanding job performance.   Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\n1\nerred. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless\nhe specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08806 at 2 (App. Bd. May 8, 2007).\nMoreover, the Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 05-03143 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\n\nThe record in this case was limited.  Applicant elected to have the case decided on the written record, and then\n2\nfiled a two page statement in response to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM).  The government\u2019s FORM\nconsisted of only four documents\u2014Applicant\u2019s two security clearance applications, the SOR, and Applicant\u2019s answer\nto the SOR.  There were no statements from independent witnesses, and the Judge did not have an opportunity to assess\nthe credibility of Applicant\u2019s statements in the context of a hearing.  The Judge based his decision in part on \u201c. . . the fact\nthat applicant offered no positive evidence concerning his character, honesty, and integrity from people who know him\nwell (e.g., family, friends, coworkers, supervisors) . . .\u201d Decision at 3.\n3\nThe absence of security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance\ndecision.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See\nISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007) citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239\n(D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An applicant with good or exemplary job\nperformance may engage in conduct that has negative security implications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples\nof off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of security concern to the government and mandate\na whole-person analysis to determine an applicant's security eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is\nnot confined to the workplace.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004). \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s two falsifications had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nThe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s two falsifications were not necessarily overcome\nby Applicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App.\nBd. Jan. 22, 2004).  In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant\nagainst the recency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.   He reasonably explained\n2\nwhy the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005). \n\n4\nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuidelines E and J is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a., through 1.d., under Guideline C and two allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b. and 1.c., and he denied the other allegations. The admissions are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: Applicant is a 26 year old employee of a defense contractor. He is not married. He received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science in 2004 from a United States university. Applicant was born Iran in 1979, and he moved to the United States in 1996. Both of his parents were born in Iran and also moved to the United States. Applicant became a United States 3 citizen in 2004.

He failed to renounce his Iranian citizenship\nor surrender his Iranian passport to the proper Iranian authorities, after indicating a willingness to\ndo so. Mitigation has not been shown. This tustworthiness determination is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that Applicant is\neligible for assignment to a sensitive position and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge\nto make a determination on this issue.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, notarized on February 20, 2007, Applicant responded to the\nSOR allegations (RSOR)and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.\nOn March 26, 2007, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision, but it was reassigned to this Administrative Judge on March\n28, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on June 1, 2007, and the hearing was\nconducted in San Jose California on June 13, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through\n4) and one witness was called. Applicant offered no documentary exhibits at the hearing but offered\nhis own testimony. The record was held open to allow Applicant to offer documentation concerning\nthe case, specifically showing that he had renounced his Iranian citizenship and returned his Iranian\npassport, but no documents were received. The transcript (Tr) was received on July 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains four allegations, 1.a., through  1.d., under Guideline C and two allegations,\n2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b. and 1.c., and he denied\nthe other allegations. The admissions are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: \nApplicant is a 26 year old employee of a defense contractor. He is not married. He received\na Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science in 2004 from a United States university. \nApplicant was born Iran in 1979, and he moved to the United States in 1996. Both of his\nparents were born in Iran and also moved to the United States. Applicant became a United States\n\n3\ncitizen in 2004. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a trustworthiness\ndetermination  because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country\nover the United States.\nApplicant applied for and was issued an Iranian passport on April 28, 2000. He traveled to\nIran from June 2000 until September 2000, and he used his Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran.\nHis Iranian passport expired on April 29, 2005. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator on April 11, 2006, he told\nthe investigator that he did not want to renounce his Iranian citizenship or relinquish his Iranian\npassport, because he wanted to retain the opportunity to return to Iran, and because his parents\nowned a home in Iran. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he was now willing to renounce his Iranian\ncitizenship, and relinquish his Iranian passport to the proper Iranian authorities (Tr at 62). The record\nwas held open for two weeks after the hearing to allow Applicant the opportunity to send to the\nproper Iranian authorities a letter indicating his renunciation of his Iranian citizenship and return of\nhis Iranian passport.  Applicant failed to submit any post hearing documents.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation\nwho are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. \nApplicant's grandmother had been a citizen and resident of  Iran. She has now moved to the\nUnited States. His other grandmother also moved to the U.S. after living in Iran. Applicant now has\nno relatives living in Iran.\nApplicant also has a boyhood friend who is a citizen and resident of Iran.  Applicant\u2019s friend\nteaches English at an Iranian institution. He last communicated with his friend one and one half years\nago. Generally, he speaks with him two times a year.\nApplicant traveled to Iran in 2000, as discussed above, to visit his grandmothers and his\nfriend. \nCurrent Status of Iran\nSince Applicant\u2019s friend is a citizen and resident of Iran, and since Applicant retained his\nIranian citizenship and passport, it is relevant to examine the status and the nature of the country.\nCurrently, Iran is considered one of the most dangerous adversaries to the interests of the United\nStates. The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since April 7, 1980, following the\nNovember 1979 Iranian student occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran and the hostage\n\n4\ntaking of 52 Americans, which was supported by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran\u2019s leader at the\ntime.\nThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are not limited\nto the following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of mass destruction, (2) its\nsponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its intervention into the internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its\naggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and (5) its human rights violation\nagainst its own people. As a result of these concerns, the U.S. prohibits most trade with Iran.\n \nPOLICIES\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \"The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\" DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for a trustworthiness determination.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" \n\n5\nThe Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with\nrespect to Guidelines C and B:\n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nGuideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicates a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States. Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship\nand surrender his expired Iranian passport must be considered adversely to Applicant and it raises\nserious Foreign Preference (Guideline C) concerns. \nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 10. (a) applies because Applicant has exercised rights and\nprivileges of foreign citizenship, by his failure to renounce his Iranian citizenship after indicating\na willingness to do so, and his retention of his Iranian passport. I find that no Mitigating Condition\n(MC) applies in this case under Guideline C, because while Applicant did state a willingness to\nrenounce his Iranian citizenship, and he was given the opportunity, but he did not do so. Therefore,\nI have determined that his stated intention to renounce his Iranian citizenship was not made in good\nfaith. Also while Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport is not current, as long as he has retained his Iranian\ncitizenship, and he has not surrendered his Iranian passport, there is nothing to prevent him from\nrenewing his Iranian passport.\n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation,\nare not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record,\nthe Government has initially established a reason to deny Applicant a access to sensitive information\nbecause of foreign influence. Since Applicant\u2019s grandmother now resides in the United States, I do\nnot find her to be a current concern. However, his boyhood friend is a citizen and resident of Iran,\na country which, as discussed above,  is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States,\nApplicant has a very heavy burden of showing that this friend does not pose a security risk. ISCR\nCase No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002). \nThe Iranian citizenship and residency of Applicant's close friend creates the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of sensitive information because it makes\nApplicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties\nraises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001\n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). This, Applicant has done. \n\n6\n  The evidence of existence of a friend, who is a  citizen and resident of Iran, comes within\nDC 7. (a), contact with a friend who is a citizen and resident of a foreign country that creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, pressure or coercion. However, I find that MC 8. (c) applies\nbecause the contact and communication between Applicant and his friend is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on the issue of Foreign Influence, I conclude\nthat the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings are hereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1. a.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.\nMartin H.

Because of poor decision-making about business finances and management,\ntax liability issues related to the business arose, and ultimately became Applicant\u2019s responsibility.\nFor a number of years, Applicant worked with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to resolve her tax\nproblems. She continues with her efforts to resolve her tax problems, even though the IRS declared\nher unpaid taxes as \u201cuncollectible\u201d. She had mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about financial\nconsiderations. Eligibility is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 18, 2004, Applicant submitted a signed application for a position of public trust,\nan ADP I/II/III position (SF-85P), which she again signed on February 17, 2005. The Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On December 11, 2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of\n1\nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative\ncomplaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to\nan administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a position of trust should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked. On January 10, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to\nthe allegations. She requested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to another administrative judge on February 8, 2007, and transferred\nthe case to me on March 8, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 16, 2007. I conducted\nthe hearing on April 10, 2007. The government submitted five exhibits (GE), which were marked and\nadmitted into the record as GE 1-5 without objection. Applicant submitted four exhibits (App Ex),\nwhich were marked and admitted as App Ex A-D without objection. Applicant testified on her own\nbehalf. I held the record open for the submission of additional documentation by the Applicant, which\nshe did. She submitted 9 additional documents, which were marked and admitted as App Ex E-M\nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits all the SOR allegations under Guideline F, but denies\nthe overall concern.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and\n2\ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s Application for a Position of Trust, dated August 18, 2004) at 1, 3, 5; Tr. at 17-18.\n3\nTr. at 20-21.\n4\nThe record contains no information as to the nature and type of unpaid tax problems the logging business\n5\ndeveloped. The unpaid taxes may relate to taxes a business must pay for its income or employee withholding taxes.\nI note that because the logging business operated as a sole proprietorship, the business income would be treated\n6\nas personal income for the owner for tax purposes.\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 2, 3; Tr. at 16-18, 39.\n7\nGE 4 (Credit report, dated June 18, 2003); GE 5 (Credit report, dated June 12, 2006); GE 6 (Credit report,\n8\ndated February 5, 2007)\n3\nApplicant, a 40-year-old woman employed as a manager by a Department of Defense\ncontractor, seeks a position of public trust. She married in 1990 and has no children.3\nIn 1991, at age 25 and without any business experience, Applicant became involved in the\noperations of a logging business with her stepfather. Rather than incorporating the business, they ran\nit as a sole proprietorship. Thus, when necessary, she purchased equipment, office supplies, business\nmaterials, and other items needed to run the business with her personal credit card.  As a result of\n4\npoor management and business decision making, unpaid taxes of an unknown type became an issue\nfor the business.  Although the business paid monies to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), it lacked\n5\nsufficient funds to pay the full amount of taxes owed. Because this business operated as a sole\nproprietorship, her personal income included income earned from the business, and its tax problems\nbecame her tax problems.  The record contains no evidence that she failed to file her personal income\n6\ntaxes in any given year.\nIn 1994, Applicant started working full-time at a bank, while continuing to work part-time in\nthe logging business, as the book and records keeper. In 1995, she began attending college. She\ngraduated in May 1998, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in accounting. In October 1998, she accepted\nan employment offer with her current employer. In 2000 or 2001, she and her stepfather ceased\noperating the logging business.7\nBased on her credit reports dated June 18, 2003, June 12, 2006, and February 5, 2007, the IRS\nfiled the following tax liens after assessing Applicant\u2019s additional tax liability:8\nSOR \u00b6\nLIEN DATE\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS\nnone\nJanuary 1996\n$  4,918.00\nReleased May 2002\n1.a\nFebruary 1996\n$  4,918.00\nCollection possibly barred by\nthe federal statute of limitations\n1.b\nMay 1996\n$  9,073.00\nCollection possibly barred by\nthe federal statute of limitations\n1.b\nMay 1996 (same as\nabove)\n$  9,073.00\nCollection possibly barred by\nthe federal statute of limitations\n\nId.\n9\n4\n1.h\nMarch 1999\n$  7,971.00\nUnpaid\n1.h\nMarch 1999 (same as\nabove)\n$  7,971.00\nUnpaid\n1.i\nMarch 1999\n$18,694.00\nUnpaid\n1.j\nMay 1999\n$  1,942.00\nUnpaid\n1.k\nDecember 1999\n$ 4,756.00\nUnpaid\n1.n\nJanuary 2003\n$ 7,213.00\nUnpaid\n1.o\nJanuary 2003\n$ 4,290.00\nUnpaid\n1.p\nDecember 2003\n$ 1,759.00\nUnpaid\nLikewise, Applicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that the state Department of Revenue also filed\nthe following tax liens against Applicant for the tax deficiencies created as a result of the operation\nof the logging business:9\nSOR \u00b6\nLIEN DATE\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS\n1.c\nJune 1996\n$   835.00\nUnpaid (Possibly barred from\ncollection by the Statute of\nLimitations)\n1.d\nOctober 1996\n$1,313.00\nUnpaid (Possibly barred from\ncollection by the Statute of\nLimitations)\n1.e\nDecember1996\n$   247.00\nUnpaid (Possibly barred from\ncollection by the Statute of\nLimitations)\n1.f\nFebruary 1998\n$   548.00\nUnpaid\nnone\nNovember 1998\n$1,144.00\nReleased August 2004\n1.g\nJanuary 1999\n$4,314.00\nUnpaid\n1.l\nJuly 2000\n$2,838.00\nUnpaid\n1.m\nSeptember 2000\n$3,675.00\nUnpaid\nThe actual tax years in question are not shown on the credit reports; Applicant, however,\nbelieves most of the liens cover tax years in the late 1990s and all are related to the logging business.\n\nGE 2 (Applicant\u2019s signed statement, dated July 18, 2005) at1, 3-4; GE 4, supra note 8; GX 5, supra note 8;\n10\nGE 6, supra note 8; Tr. at 21.\nGE 2, supra note 10, at 1, 3-4; GE 5, supra note 8, at 1; App Ex A (Letter, dated April 9, 2007); App Ex L\n11\n(Copies of tax payments made by the business); Response to SOR, supra note 2.\nApp Ex M (Applicant statement, faxed on May 21, 2007); Tr. at 51, 59.\n12\nApp Ex B (Form 433-D); App Ex C (Form 433-A); GE 2, supra note 10, at 24-31.\n13\nThe IRS mailed this letter 30 days after Applicant walked into its office on March 9, 2007. App Ex A, supra\n14\nnote 11.\nGE 5, supra note 8, at 1; App Ex J (Notification from state on 2003 and 2004 tax refund); App Ex H (State\n15\ntax return for 2005); App Ex I (State tax return for 2006); Tr. at 24-25.\n5\nThe unpaid federal taxes total approximately, $60,600 and the unpaid state taxes total approximately\n$14,000.10\nWhile in operation and after she understood her responsibility to do so, the business made tax\npayments to the IRS, but the payments were insufficient to satisfy the actual tax liability. Until 2002,\nApplicant regularly met with an IRS representative to discuss a resolution of her tax issues. In 2002,\nshe paid one federal tax lien, which has been released by the IRS. She believes that in 2002, she paid\na second lien in the amount of $9,073 and that all liens for the year 1996 are paid or beyond the\nstatutory time line to collect, but has not provided verifying documentation. Subsequently, she made\noffers for a compromise settlement and payment by installment agreement, which the IRS rejected.\nThe IRS currently considers her unpaid taxes as \u201cuncollectible\u201d.  Thus, the IRS has not sought to\n11\nenforce its lien through court proceedings or by a levy proceeding, such as garnishing her wages to\ncollect her back taxes, or taking her yearly tax refunds as an offset against her unpaid tax debt. In the\npast, Applicant and her husband tried to refinance their house to help pay her tax liability, but could\nnot obtain financing because of the tax liens. This problem continues.12\nIn August 2006, Applicant completed IRS form 433-D (Installment Agreement) and Form\n433-A (Collection Information Statement for Wage Earners and Self-Employed Individuals) and\nsubmitted it to the IRS. She again made an offer of compromise, and alternately, offered to repay her\nfederal tax liens at the rate of $500 a month.  The IRS has not acted on her most recent offer for\n13\nrepayment through an installment agreement, indicating in a letter dated April 9, 2007 that it needed\nthirty days to consider a complete financial statement.  \n14\nThe state Department of Revenue applies her and her husband\u2019s yearly tax refund to her\noutstanding tax liens. For 2003, her refund totaled $530; for 2004, it totaled $246; for 2005, it totaled\n$624; and for 2006, it totaled $917. These payments reduced her tax liability by approximately\n$2,300, and should lead to the release of several small state tax liens listed in her credit reports. She\nhas no other payment arrangement with the state; however, the state will continue to take her tax\nrefunds until her debt is paid. The most recent credit report reflects that in 2004, one state tax lien had\nbeen paid and released.15\n\nApp Ex E (Applicant\u2019s compensation records for March and April 2007); Applicant Exhibit C (IRS Form 433-\n16\nA, dated August 14, 2006) at 6; App Ex F (Applicant\u2019s 2006 federal tax return); Tr. at 43-47.\nApp Ex E, supra note 16. Based on Applicant\u2019s income and expense analysis in IRS Form 433-A, her\n17\nhusband\u2019s gross income is $2,024 a month. Their combined monthly withholdings are $1,150. Since her compensation\nrecords reflect $829 a month for her monthly tax withholdings, her husband\u2019s monthly tax withholdings total $321.

Her\n16\nnet monthly income totals $2,660 and her husband\u2019s net monthly income is estimated at $1,700 for\na net monthly income of $4,360.  Based on record evidence and hearing testimony, her estimated\n17\nmonthly expenses are $3,700. Her husband owns two rental houses. She estimates the monthly\nincome from these properties to be $650, which is higher than the monthly income of $590 in 2006.\nThe monthly expenses for these properties totaled approximately $813 in 2006. At the current rental\nincome level, they must provide approximately $165 in additional funds each month for the operation\nof these properties. She and her husband have looked at several options in an effort to resolve her tax\nissues, but none of the possible options, such as selling the car or rental houses, would produce\nincome to pay her tax liabilities.18\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor praises her work skills, responsibilities, and work ethic. He rated her\na 4.5, a very high performance rating. He advises that she has not had any corrective actions during\nher employment and that she is respected and trusted by co-workers, beneficiaries, and providers. He\nspecifically noted that her performance review includes a section of responsibility, which is defined\nas 1) demonstrates accountability for actions; 2) acts in the best interest of the company; and 3) acts\nin a complaint and ethical manner; and that she is consistently rated at the 4 or 5 level in this section,\nthe two highest performance ratings.  The record contains no evidence which indicates that Applicant\n19\nhas resorted to illegal activity as a means to resolve her financial difficulties.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against a trustworthiness determination is not outcome determinative, the\nrevised AG should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In\naddition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these\nare: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\n\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b62(a)(1)-(9).\n20\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n21\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., December 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n22\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The\n21\ngovernment has the burden of proving controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify\nthe applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The burden of proof is\n22\nsomething less than a preponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the\n23\nburden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome\nthe case against him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n24\nfavorable clearance decision.  Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be\n25\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative\nguidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n26\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n27\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n28\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n29\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. Any\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n30\nfor access to sensitive positions.\n\n8\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit reports reflect many liens\nfiled by the federal government and state government for unpaid taxes, which applicant acknowledged.\nShe incurred these tax liabilities when she worked with her stepfather in a very small sole\nproprietorship business. Because of the age of these debts, their delinquent status, and the amount of\nthe debt, Applicant showed an inability or unwillingness to pay her debts. Based on the evidence of\nrecord, the government established the applicability of DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nMC \u00b6 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment may be raised in this case. Because the tax liens involve several\nyears of unpaid taxes in the 1990s, Applicant\u2019s failure to pay taxes was not infrequent although long\nago. Her tax liability issues arose from her involvement in a business which was never incorporated,\nbut run as a sole proprietorship, a business format which would leave her legally liable for the debts\nof the business. The business closed six or seven years ago. Since this time, she has not attempted to\noperate another business; rather, she works for a company. In addition, she has not incurred any\nadditional tax problems unrelated to the business operation. \nMC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances has no\napplicability because an individual has the responsibility to assure that when operating a business,\nsufficient funds exist to pay taxes. Poor business management is not a condition beyond an\nindividual\u2019s control.\nApplicant never met with a financial counselor and significant back taxes are due. Thus, MC\n\u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control has no applicability.\nMC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts may apply. Applicant\u2019s tax issues are significant. She has not ignored her problem nor\ndid she fail to file her taxes. Rather, her tax liabilities arose because she and stepfather did not properly\nmanage the logging business and its related tax liabilities. For several years, she worked with the IRS\non paying the taxes. After closing the business, she continued to actively work on resolving her tax\n\nMC \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and (f) are not applicable in this case.\n31\n9\nliability. She offered a compromise settlement of her debt, which the IRS rejected. Nine months ago,\nshe again offered the IRS a compromise settlement of her debt and/or payment through an installment\nplan. After months of no response, she visited her local IRS office to find out about her case. Thirty\ndays later, the IRS wrote a letter acknowledging her request for an installment agreement and requested\ntime to review a complete financial statement. She has not ignored or refused to acknowledge her tax\nliability issues. She has made a good faith effort to resolve her problems with the IRS, but is currently\nhampered by the slowness of the IRS. Her old, unpaid state taxes are being repaid slowly through the\nstate\u2019s application of her yearly refunds to her debts. Because of the tax liens, she cannot obtain\nfinancing to pay her tax debt in full.31\nAs a general rule, the IRS must prepare and file an assessment of income tax it believes due\nwithin three years after the return is filed. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a). Once an assessment is complete,\nit has 60 days to give notice and a demand for payment of the tax due to the person liable. See 26\nU.S.C. \u00a7 6303(a). Once the notice and demand are made, a lien in favor of the United States\nautomatically arises. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321. The IRS must file a levy or institute court proceedings\nwithin 10 years after the tax assessment to collect the tax lien. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602(a)(1); United\nStates v. Galletti, 541 U.S. 114, 119 (2004). The running of the statute of limitations is tolled during\na bankruptcy proceeding, see United States v. Doe, 438 F.Supp.2d (S.D. Ohio 2006), by agreements\n(made before Dec. 20, 2000), see United States v. Ryals, 480 F.3d 1101, 1106(11th Cir. 2007), or\nwhile an offer in compromise (made on or after Dec. 31, 1999) is pending. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6404(a)\nprovides for abatement of an assessment when it is uncollectible. The state law also generally follows\nthe 3-year and 10-year statute of limitations used by the IRS. See Code \u00a7 12-54-85.\nAlthough Applicant believes that her 1996 liens are beyond the collection period, she indicated\nthat she made earlier offers in compromise, which were rejected by the IRS. Because the file lacks\nmore specific information about the earlier offers of compromise, all of her unpaid taxes may still be\ncollectible. She did make an offer of compromise in August 2006, which is currently being considered\neven though the IRS has considered her outstanding taxes uncollectible. At this time, the status of her\nfederal tax liability remains unresolved. Her unpaid state taxes are slowly being repaid.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nBecause the IRS has determined that Applicant\u2019 unpaid taxes are \u201cuncollectible\u201d, her potential\nvulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is\u201cfinancially overextended\u201d has been\neliminated. This determination does not negate her past conduct in not paying her outstanding taxes.\nApplicant\u2019s tax problems arose as a result of her naivete about running a business and her reliance on\n\n10\nher stepfather. She became involved in a logging business with her stepfather when she was young and\ninexperienced. She assumed responsibilities for business expenses, including tax liability, in an\nunincorporated business without realizing the nature and extent of the problems which would become\nher personal responsibility. She lacked proper business operational skills when she became involved\nin the logging business, and received little guidance on good business practices from her stepfather.\nThus, these factors contributed to her lack of understanding of the business\u2019s tax issues. She did not\nfail to file her taxes nor did the business fail to provide tax money to the IRS; rather, it appears that\nthe business lacked sufficient funds to pay the full amount of its tax bill. Ultimately, the liability for\nthe unpaid taxes became hers because the business was a sole proprietorship. Slowly, she realized the\nextent of her problems caused by the business and developed a working relationship with the IRS in\nan effort to resolve her tax problems. She continues to work towards a resolution of the federal tax\nissues even though the IRS has declared her unpaid taxes uncollectible. She has not avoided her tax\nliability problems nor has she ignored them. Due to the slowness of working through the IRS system\nand the impossibility of obtaining financing to immediately resolve her tax liability, this issue remains\nunresolved. While she has not taken a more aggressive approach to resolving her state tax issues, the\nissues are being slowly resolved. \nShe manages her regular monthly expenses and remains current on her debt payments. Her\nsupervisor praises her work skills, including her ethics and commitment to working in the company\u2019s\nbest interest. He considers her an asset, reliable, and trustworthy. I have weighed the mitigating factors\nagainst the seriousness of her unpaid tax liability. I have concluded that under the specific\ncircumstances of this case, she would not act in a manner which would harm her employer or the\ngovernment. There is little likelihood she would violate the privacy rights she must protect in order\nto resolve her tax problems. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns pertaining to financial\nconsiderations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-p:\n  For Applicant\nDECISION\n\n11\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Edmunds, Esquire, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nThe Applicant\u2019s last incident involving criminal behavior occurred in 1995, more than 12\nyears ago.  The last four incidents of criminal behavior, in 1985, 1986, 1991 and 1995, all involved\nthe Applicant\u2019s wife, who suffers from alcohol abuse and depression.  Often, he was on the receiving\nend of the spousal abuse.  \u201cThere is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation\u201d on the part of both\nthe Applicant and his spouse, as evidenced by seven letters of recommendation, and his spouse\u2019s\nadmission.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 28, 2006, however, the Government was\nnot \u201cReady to Proceed\u201d with this case until April 9, 2007.\nThe case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge, but was reassigned to the\nundersigned on May 8, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day, and the case was heard\non June 20, 2007.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from\nthe Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence, and who called a witness to testify on his\nbehalf.  The transcript (TR) was received on July 18, 2007.  The issue raised here is whether the\nApplicant's admitted past criminal activity militates against the granting of a security clearance.  [The\nApplicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations, except for subparagraph 1.f.,\nin that he categorically denies that any criminal incident occurred in 2005.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 54 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor,\nwhich seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n1.a.  The Applicant was arrested in July of 1971, and subsequently charged with Possession\nof Narcotic - Marijuana (TR at page 27 line 11 to page 28 line 18).  Although this charge was\nultimately dismissed, the Applicant admits the marijuana possession, when he was 19 years of age\n(Id).\n\n3\nThe Applicant was married to his current spouse in 1983 (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at\npage 2).  She suffers from alcohol abuse and depression (TR at page 47 line 21 to page 48 line 22,\nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) R).\n1.b.  The Applicant was arrested in September of 1985, and subsequently charged with a\nBattery, in an incident involving his spouse (TR at page 28 line 23 to page 29 line 12, and GX 6 at\npage 4).  This charge was ultimately dismissed (Id).\n1.c.  The Applicant was arrested in November of 1986, and subsequently charged with Inflict\nCorporal Injury to Spouse/Co-Habitant (Felony) (TR at page 29 line 13 to page 31 line 7, and GXs\n2 and 5).  This charge was not prosecuted due to \u201cLack of Corpus,\u201d as both spouses showed signs\nof Corporal Injury (GX 5 at page 12).\n1.d.  The Applicant was arrested in September of 1991, and again subsequently charged with\nInflict Corporal Injury to Spouse/Co-Habitant (Felony) (TR at page 31 lines 8~21, and GXs 2 and\n4).  This charge was ultimately dismissed (Id).\n1.e.  The Applicant was detained in June of 1995, and subsequently charged with Spousal\nAbuse (TR at page 32 line 20 to page 33 line 7, at page 49 line 18 to page 51 line 13 and GX 3).\nThis charge was ultimately dismissed (Id).  After this last incident, the Applicant\u2019s spouse sought\nprofessional help to combat her depression (TR at page 49 line 18 to page 51 line 13, and AppX R).\n1.f.  The Applicant categorically denies that any criminal incident occurred in 2005 (TR at\npage 33 lines 8~19, at page 34 lines 13~22, and at page 45 line 22 to page 46 line 10).  The\nGovernment has offered no evidence showing that any incident occurred.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\n\n4\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline J (criminal conduct), which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance\nholder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has\ndemonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there exists the possibility that an applicant may\ndemonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant\u2019s admitted past Criminal Conduct is evidenced by four arrests occurring in\n1971, 1985, 1986 and 1991; and a detention occurring in 1995.  The first and second disqualifying\nconditions under Criminal Conduct are therefore applicable, as there are \u201c[a]llegations or admissions\nof criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cmultiple lesser offenses\u201d present.

As of the date of his hearing, he had 12 accounts, owing approximately $22,300, that\nhave been delinquent for many years. His evidence is insufficient to show he has a track record of\nfinancial responsibility. Furthermore, he deliberately falsified his security clearance application.\nClearance is denied. \n\n  (*) Concerning his last name change, Applicant explained his mother changed his last name when he was three\n1\nyears old and he used that name for many years. He changed his last name back to his father\u2019s last name when he became\nan adult.\n  GE 1 (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated November 1, 2005.\n2\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as amended,\n3\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992) (Directive), as amended.\n  AE 2 was submitted post-hearing. I left the record open to allow Applicant time to submit additional\n4\ninformation. AE 2 includes a government memorandum indicating Department Counsel did not object to the exhibit.\n  On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) (USDI) published a memorandum\n5\ndirecting application of the revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive in which a statement of reasons has not been issued by September 1, 2006. (emphasis added)\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 1, 2005, Applicant  submitted a security clearance application.  On August\n1\n2\n17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available\nto the Government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information and\nrecommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a security determination.  On\n3\nSeptember 3, 2006, November 2, 2006 (notarized), and December 4, 2006 (notarized), Applicant\nsubmitted answers to the SOR and requested a hearing.\nOn February 15, 2007, the government moved to amend the SOR and provided Applicant\nwith 30 days to object to the government\u2019s motion and to answer the SOR. The amended SOR added\none Guideline E allegation, and alleged additional security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations). Applicant answered the amended SOR on March 18, 2007. He did not object to the\ngovernment\u2019s motion to amend the SOR in his answer to the SOR, or at the hearing. I granted the\nmotion.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 1, 2007. On March 27, 2007, I convened a hearing\nat which the government presented four exhibits, marked GE 1-4, to support the SOR. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf, and presented two exhibits, marked AE 1-2,  which were admitted\n4\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 11, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUE\nBecause Applicant\u2019s SOR was issued prior to the effective date of the revised adjudicative\nguidelines, I applied the provisions of the Directive (old Guidelines) to Applicant\u2019s case.5\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n4\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations except those contained in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.d, with\nexplanations. I considered SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.d, denied, because he denied doing so with the deliberate\nintent to mislead the government. His admissions and explanations are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the evidence, I make\nthe following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old security guard working for a defense contractor. He graduated\nfrom high school in June 1989. He has no military service. Applicant has never been married. He\nhas a 15-year-old daughter for whom he provides support. He has worked for his current employer,\nand has held an interim security clearance at the secret level since February 2004.\nIn his November 2005 security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question\n23a (asking whether he had ever been charged with of convicted or any felony offense); question 23d\n(asking whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or\ndrugs); question 23f (asking whether in the last seven years he had been arrested for, charged with,\nof convicted of any offense otherwise not disclosed); question 28a (asking whether in the last seven\nyears he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debt); and question 28b (asking whether he was\ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debt). \nThe subsequent background investigation revealed that between 1980 and 2004, he had been\narrested and charged with the offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a through 1.f. Concerning the allegation\nin \u00b6 1.a, Applicant explained that in 1980, he served as a lookout for a friend who was stealing a\ncar\u2019s license tags. He was charged with theft over $500, a felony, and theft over $300. He was found\nguilty of a lesser offense and sentenced to serve community service. (Tr. 72-73) He was\napproximately 20 years old at the time of the offense.\nIn 1981, Applicant and a friend were arrested while in possession of stolen property.\nApplicant was charged with receiving stolen property. (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b) Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.c,\nhe explained he was moving his household goods in a pick up truck when he was stopped by the\npolice. During the ensuing search of his person and vehicle, the policemen found a pellet pistol, the\nremains of a marijuana cigarette, and a knife. He was charged with carrying a pistol without a\nlicense, a violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, and carrying a dangerous weapon\n(knife). Applicant testified he pled guilty to the weapon and knife charges and was sentenced to serve\nsix months of supervised probation. (Tr. 79-80)\nRegarding the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d, he explained that, while drunk, he confused his car\nwith another person\u2019s car and was arrested while attempting to change a tire. He was using his own\njack and iron head to change the tire. He was charged with possession of burglary tools and\nattempted larceny. The charges were latter dismissed. (Tr. 80-81) In 1994, Applicant was stopped\nby the police and the ensuing search revealed a \u201cdime bag of weed\u201d (marijuana) he had purchased\nthrough a friend for his own use. He was charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. (SOR\n\u00b6 1.e) He was sentenced to perform 40 hours of community service. (Tr. 83-85) Applicant testified\nthat when he was 32 to 33 years old, he smoked marijuana at least every other day. He stopped using\nmarijuana in 1995. (Tr. 86) In 2004, Applicant was involved in an altercation with his then\ngirlfriend, and was charged with simple assault. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) The charge was later dismissed.\n\n  GE 2 (Credit report, dated January 2007), and GE 3 (Credit report, dated December 2005).\n6\n5\nThe background investigation also revealed Applicant has 12 delinquent/charged off debts,\nowing approximately $22,300. The debts became delinquent and were assigned to collection between\nFebruary 2002 and May 2005.  Applicant admitted these were his debts. He presented little or no\n6\nevidence to explain why the alleged debts became delinquent, what efforts, if any, he has taken to\npay, settle, or resolve the debts, whether he has been making payment on other debts, or whether he\nhas taken any measures to avoid future financial problems.\nApplicant has been consistently employed as a security guard for the last 10 years. In October\n2006, he began working a second job as a security guard seeking a better paying job. In February\n2006, he was interviewed by a government background investigator, and was confronted about his\ndelinquent obligations. Applicant took no action to pay, settle, or resolve his delinquencies from\nFebruary 2006 to the day of his hearing. He claimed he has no money left at the end of the month\nand could not afford paying his old delinquent debts and his current debts and living expenses. (Tr.\n101, 120) When asked why/how he had accumulated so many small debts, Applicant explained he\nwas lazy and did not pay his debts on time. (Tr. 113) He testified he has been using whatever money\nhe has left over at the end of the month to fix his apartment, and to purchase new furniture and other\ngoods. (Tr. 121)\nApplicant has a 15 year-old-daughter. He started making court ordered child support\npayments for his daughter around 2002 when she was age 10. According to Applicant\u2019s state\u2019s Child\nSupport Services obligation summary, dated March 14, 2007, he is $19,369 in arrearage.\nDuring his 2006 interview, Applicant was also confronted with some of his past criminal\nbehavior. He admitted to the investigator that he was charged with assault in 2004 and possession\nof burglary tools in 1993. Applicant was then asked whether he had been arrested, charged with, or\nconvicted of any other offenses. He told the investigator \u201cNo,\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose the\nincidents alleged under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c, and 1.e. \nApplicant provided several explanations for his failure to disclose his past criminal behavior,\ni.e., he believed the 20-year-old charges would not show up in the background investigation or the\ngovernment would not investigate that far back (Tr. 62-63); he did not understand the question (Tr.\n16); since some of the charges were dropped, he believe he did not have to disclose the arrest or\ncharges; prior to completing his security clearance application, he looked at his records and believed\nit would have been very difficult for the government to find out about his old criminal records. (Tr.\n63)\nApplicant knew he was required to be candid and forthright in his answers to the security\nclearance application. (Tr. 97) He expressed remorse for deliberately falsifying the security clearance\napplication, and stated he had learned his lesson. He promised never to lie again about his past\nbehavior in any other application. He explained his current job is the best job he has ever had and\ndid not want to loose it. He falsified his application because he was afraid that if he disclosed his past\ncriminal behavior he would loose his interim security clearance and his job. (Tr. 92) \n\n  Directive \u00b6 6.3. Each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\n7\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure\n2.\n  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201c. . . The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as\n8\nthe whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nshould be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of the nature\nand seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the age of the\napplicant; the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or\nundertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and the probability\nthat the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n9\n6\nConcerning his failure to disclose his delinquent debts, Applicant explained he did not know\nit was important for him to disclose his delinquent debts, or that they would be a concern for the\ngovernment. He believed he could resolve his financial problems on his own, and elected not to\ndisclose the information. \nApplicant considers himself to be reliable, dependable, and a hard worker. There is no\nevidence he has mishandled or caused the compromise of classified information while employed by\na defense contractor. He was adamant about how much he loves his job, and his desire to receive a\nsecurity clearance to be able to continue working as a security guard. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances\nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence\nor absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the whole person concept.\n7\n8\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are the applicable\nrelevant adjudicative guidelines.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n9\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness\nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \n\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n10\nthan a preponderance of the evidence.); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531.\n11\n  See, id.; Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n12\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A10.1.1.\n13\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.1.\n14\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.2. \n15\n7\nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it\n10\nis not clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels\n11\nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information\nin favor of protecting national security.12\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), a history or pattern of criminal conduct is a security\nconcern because it may indicate an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations and may show the\napplicant to be lacking in judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  The government established its\n13\ncase under Guideline J by showing that Applicant was implicated in six offenses between 1980 and\n2004. He was convicted in 1980 for theft, in 1988 for carrying a dangerous weapon (knife), and in\n1993 for misdemeanor attempted larceny. I also find, as discussed below under Guideline E, that\nApplicant deliberately falsified his 2005 security clearance application and deliberately made a false\nstatement to a government investigator. His falsification of the SF 86, and his false statement are\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. 1001, a felony. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: Allegations or admission of\ncriminal conduct,  and DC 2: A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses  apply.\n14\n15\nApplicant\u2019s past behavior, from 1980 to 2006, forms a pattern of criminal activity. His\nfalsification brings to the forefront the criminal conduct and financial considerations concerns raised\nby his past behavior. Under the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is\nrecent and not isolated. Applicant has engaged in criminal misconduct over a period of at least 26\nyears, from the time he was 18 until age 44. Applicant\u2019s last two incidents of criminal misconduct\nare his falsification of the security clearance application in 2005, and his false statement to the\ngovernment investigator in 2006. Considering his history of criminal behavior, the nature and\nseriousness of his misconduct, his falsification of the SF 86, his false statement, and his disregard for\nthe law, I decide Guideline J against Applicant. His behavior raises questions about his ability and\nwillingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information.\n\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A6.1.1.\n16\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1.\n17\n8\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), a security concern exists when a person has\nsignificant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk to engage in illegal\nor unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.  Similarly, an individual who is\n16\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in his/her obligation to\nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life can often\nindicate how a person may behave in other aspects of life.\nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to the early\n2000s. He accumulated approximately $22,300 in 12 debts resulting from his abuse of his credit and\nhis lack of financial responsibility. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1: A\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; and FC DC 3: Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\napply in this case. \nI considered all Guideline F Mitigating Conditions (MC) and I conclude none apply. He\npresented little or no evidence to explain why the alleged debts became delinquent, what efforts, if\nany, he has taken to pay, settle, or resolve the debts, whether he has been making payment on other\ndebts, or whether he has taken any measures to avoid future financial problems. The evidence shows\nApplicant ignored his delinquent debts and took little or no action to pay or resolve his debts.\nAlthough he has been consistently employed during the last 10 years, he presented no evidence of\ncircumstances beyond his control that would have prevented him from paying his debts. On balance,\nand after careful consideration of all information, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he\nhas dealt responsibly with his financial obligations. His financial history and lack of favorable\nevidence preclude a finding that he has established a track record of financial responsibility. Guideline\nF is decided against Applicant.\nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the ultimate\nquestion \u2013 whether a person\u2019s past conduct instills confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified information. An applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.17\nThe government established, and Applicant admitted, that he deliberately failed to disclose\nhis past criminal behavior in his response to questions 23.a, 23.d, and 23.f of his security clearance\napplication, and that he made a false statement to a government investigator. He deliberately\nfalsified his security clearance application, and deliberately made a false statement, because he was\nafraid that disclosing his past criminal behavior would adversely affect his ability to obtain a\nsecurity clearance and he would lose his job. I am also convinced that Applicant deliberately failed\nto disclose his delinquent debts in his response to question 28. Numerous factors weighed in my\nanalysis to reach that conclusion, including: Applicant\u2019s age, his employment history, his demeanor\nand testimony, the number and value of the debts, his long term disregard of the debts, and his\ndeliberate falsification of other answers in the application. I also considered the same reasons\npreviously outlined under the Guideline J and Guideline F discussions, incorporated herein.\n\n9\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2: the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, applies.\nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions and conclude that none\napply. Considering that the falsification occurred in 2005, and he made his false statement in 2006,\nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to support the applicability of any of the mitigating\nconditions. Additionally, for the same reasons outlined above under the discussion of Guidelines\nJ and F, incorporated herein, I conclude Applicant\u2019s behavior shows questionable judgment, lack\nof reliability, and untrustworthiness. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the whole person\nconcept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s maturity and his years of good performance working\nfor a defense contractor. Considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances, Applicant\ndemonstrated a lack in judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial affairs.\nMoreover, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to mitigate the overall judgment, honesty,\nand trustworthiness security concerns raised by his falsifications.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are\nas follows:\nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct (Guideline J)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct (Guideline E)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.e\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Financial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nJuan J.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony. The Applicant is 51 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.

The Applicant\u2019s father and two brothers are citizens of and reside in Serbia.\nNone of the Applicant\u2019s immediate family have a connection with the Serbian government or with\nany other government.  Furthermore, the Applicant is not subject to coercion vis-a-vis these foreign\nrelatives.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\n___________________\n\u00b9 The Applicant has no middle name (Transcript (TR) at page 4 line 21 to page 5 line 4).\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 18, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 1, 2006.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on December 18, 2006.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on January 16, 2007, and the case was heard on February 6, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence.  The transcript was received on February 21, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the\nApplicant's perceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence militate against the granting of a\nsecurity clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations,\nexcept for subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.d., as she has surrendered her Serbian passport.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 51 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Applicant was born in the Serbian area of what was called Yugoslavia in 1956 (TR at\npage 27 line 8 to page 28 line 12).  She immigrated to the U.S., and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen\nin 1984 (Id, and Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 1).\n1.a., 1.b. and 1.d.  The Applicant has renounced her Serbian citizenship, and has surrendered\n\n3\nher Serbian passport in compliance with the Money Memorandum (TR at page 44 line 19 to page 45\nline 14, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and D).\n1.c.  The Applicant has traveled to Serbia on at least four occasions since 2000 (TR at page\n46 line 20 to page 48 line 21, and GX 1 at pages 8~9).  Whenever she traveled to Serbia, she\ntendered  her American passport first, and only tendered her Serbian passport when asked by Serbian\nimmigration officials at her point of entry (TR at page 71 line 12 to page 72 line 5, and AppX D the\nlast page).\n\n The Appeal Board has determined that such relatives are \u201cother relatives,\u201d and not\n2\n\u201cimmediate family members.\u201d  ISCR Case NO. 02-26978 (September 21, 2005) at page 7.\n4\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a.  The Applicant\u2019s father and two brothers are citizens of and reside in Serbia (GX 1 at\npages 4~5).  Her father is a retired farmer (TR at page 29 line 24 to page 30 line 7, and at page 39\nline 25 to page 40 line 10).  Her older brother works in a private plastics factory, and cares for her\nelderly father (TR at page 31 lines 7~19, and at page 41 lines 1~15).  Her younger brother is sick\nwith a lung ailment, as a result of working in the same plastics factory (TR at page 30 line 8 to page\n31 line 5, at page 32 lines 3~11, and at page 40 lines 11~25).\n2.b.  The Applicant also has cousins, nieces and nephews who are citizens of and residents\nof Serbia (GX 1 at pages 4~5).  She refers to them, in part, as \u201cfar\u201d relatives TR at page 32 line 12\nto page 35 line 3, and at page 36 line 8 to page 37 line 23).   She has little direct contact with these\n2\nrelatives (Id).\n2.c.  The Applicant has contacts with a Serbian band, on an annual basis (TR at page 37 line\n24 to page 39 line 22, and at page 60 line 19 to page 62 line 3).  This band has no connection with\nthe Serbian government, but rather plays at church weddings on their annual visit to America (Id).\nFollowing a May 21, 2006, referendum on the independence of Montenegro, Serbia\nannounced that it would be the successor state to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.  The\ndissolution of the State Union has been peaceful.  Serbia is a parliamentary democracy with\napproximately 10.2 million inhabitants.  While civilian authorities generally maintained effective\ncontrol of the security forces, there were a few instances in which elements of the security forces\nacted independently of government authority.  However, the government\u2019s increased efforts in\naddressing human rights violations have brought notable improvements.  Serbia does not appear to\nbe a high level participant in espionage vis-a-vis the U.S. (See GXs 3 and 4).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na.  Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb.  Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc.  Age and maturity of the applicant.\n\n5\nd.  Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne.  Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf.  Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past disqualifying conduct, is\nunlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to a Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant was a dual national with Serbia, and until recently maintained a Serbian\npassport.  The first and second disqualifying conditions under Foreign Preference are therefore\napplicable as there was an \"exercise of dual citizenship,\" with the \"possession . . . of a foreign\npassport.\"  This is countered, however, by her compliance with the last mitigating condition, when\nshe renounced his Serbian citizenship; and by her compliance with the Money Memorandum, when\nshe surrendered his Serbian passport.\nThe Applicant's father, and two brothers are citizens of and reside in Serbia.  The first\ndisqualifying condition is therefore applicable as \"[a]n immediate family member . . . is a citizen of\na foreign country.\"  This is countered, however, by the first mitigating condition, as there is no\nevidence that their presence in Serbia can \"be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force\nthe individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.\"  In \n\n6\naddition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant would even consider any such\nattempt at exploitation.\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, her manager and a vice\npresident of her employer, speak most highly of her character, credibility and trustworthiness (AppX\nB).  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly\nwarrants a favorable recommendation under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.\nGuidelines B and C are thus found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her\nalleged Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating\nconditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive. Accordingly, she has met\nher ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B and C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.  For the Applicant.\nb.  For the Applicant.\nc.  For the Applicant.\nd.  For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.  For the Applicant.\nb.  For the Applicant.\nc.  For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIn this case, Applicant elected to have a decision based upon the written record, and then did\nnot respond to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM).

On April 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Use), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and responded by letter, notarized\non June 1, 2007, in which he denied allegations 1.a) and 1.b) under Guideline H. He\nalso requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge and identified his personal\nrepresentative. Accompanying that letter was another letter dated June 1, 2007, from\nApplicant\u2019s personal representative. The personal representative entered his\nappearance and submitted three letters of recommendation on Applicant\u2019s behalf.\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n Tr. 89-102.\n1\n Tr. 101.\n2\n2\nDOHA received the case for assignment to an Administrative Judge on October\n2, 2007, and I was assigned the case on October 17, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was\nissued by DOHA on October 17, 2007, setting the hearing for November 2, 2007.\nApplicant, with his personal representative, and Department Counsel timely appeared\nand the hearing commenced. Department Counsel introduced thirty documents on\nbehalf of the government, which were admitted as Exhibits (Exs.) 1\u201330. Applicant\noffered four exhibits, which were accepted into the record as Exs. A\u2013D. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on November 13, 2007, and, as noted below, the record was closed\non December 7, 2007.\nDuring the November 2, 2007, hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend\nthe SOR and the parties orally addressed the allegations raised. In order to perfect his\nexact wording for the record,  Department Counsel was given until November 10, 2007,\n1\nto provide a written draft of his proposed amendments to the tribunal and to Applicant.2\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s amended allegations contained an allegation that Applicant\nfalsified material facts in a sworn statement to an investigator on December 6, 2006,\nwhen he denied using any type of drugs since 1978 and that he had not had\nsubsequent adverse law enforcement contact since 1996. In a timely response, dated\nNovember 7, 2007, Applicant denied the two allegations, noting that the handwritten\ninvestigative notes paraphrase discussion with Applicant and do not disclose violations\nfor use or under the influence of marijuana after 1978, and further noting that the\nsubsequent adverse law enforcement contact referenced were civil in nature. On\nNovember 29, 2007, Department Counsel correctly stated: \u201cThe distinction between\ncriminal offenses and ordinance violations for drug possession and [sic] whether\nApplicant was criminally charged with drug use on his FBI record are not relevant or\ngermane to the falsification. With each side afforded an opportunity to address the new\nallegations in writing and with no further submissions offered, the record was closed on\nDecember 7, 2007. After consideration of the proposed amendments, the applicable\nstandards and case law governing SOR amendment, Applicant\u2019s opportunities to\naddress the issues raised, and the positions expressed by both sides in their post-\nhearing submissions, I grant Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Note: Despite this wording, Applicant later \u201cexplained that his perception of what the word drug is, is\n6\nthat it had to do with cocaine, heroine. Hard \u2013 what we classify as hard drugs. He did not feel it applied to\nmarijuana.\u201d Tr. 93; Tr. 71-72.\n3\n1989. Of those incidents, he denied seven of the related allegations in his May 16,\n2007, answer to the SOR.  \n3\nIn Applicant\u2019s April 13, 2007, answer to the SOR, which included explanations,\nhe denied seven of the incidents, including denials to two arrests (SOR \u00b6 1.e and \u00b6\n1.h.). Regarding the other denied allegations, Applicant noted that the charges arising\nfrom four of the incidents were ultimately dismissed (SOR \u00b6 1.b, 1.g, \u00b61.l, and \u00b61.n) and\nnoted he ultimately was found not guilty of one charge (\u00b6 1.j). Regarding two contempt\nallegations, Applicant stated that the matter was resolved when he explained he was\nunaware of the court date and the case refiled in one situation (\u00b6 1.k) while another was\ndismissed when he again explained he had not received the warrant (\u00b6 1.l). He\nadmitted the remainder of the allegations, including arrests and/or convictions for\npossession of marijuana, cocaine, and barbiturate (arrests and referral to a diversionary\nprogram after found guilty of charges); obstruction and trespassing (arrest and\nconviction); possession of marijuana (arrest and conviction); theft (arrest and\nconviction); drunk driving (arrest and conviction); possession of marijuana and cocaine\n(arrests and convictions).\nApplicant further admits that, on February 20, 1990, he was charged and found\nguilty of disorderly conduct. He was fined $130. (SOR \u00b6 1.o). He also admits he was\narrested for sexual assault and family offense/welfare of child on or around June 19,\n1990, but notes that the charges were dismissed. (SOR \u00b6 1.q). He denies knowledge of\nthe allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.p) that he was arrested on March 6, 1990, for contempt,\nattributing the citation to one possibly made in error and properly belonging to a third\nparty.  \n4\nOn or about December 10, 1996, Applicant was charged with possession of\ncontrolled substance, possession of marijuana/hash, possession of LSD, and\nmanufacture/distribute controlled substance, a felony. During the investigation,\nApplicant was identified as a supplier of marijuana.  Applicant asserts that the LSD\n5\nbelonged to a friend that was staying with him. He conceded, however, that the\nmarijuana belonged to him for use by himself and his girlfriend: \u201cI guess I was still doing\ndrugs back then you know, smoking pot. . . . \u201c  He was found guilty and sentenced to\n6\nfive years in prison with credit for two days served, his driver\u2019s license was suspended\nfor two years, and he was fined approximately $2,175; he served approximately 60 to\n90 days in prison and released on 18 months probation in lieu of further incarceration.\nAlthough Applicant still denies the allegations reflected in SOR \u00b6 1.r, he admits he pled\n\n See Answer to SOR, dated April 13, 2007.\n7\n Tr. 61-62.\n8\n Ex. 29 (Office of the Prosecutor file, dated August 5, 2005) at 3; Ex. 30 (State Disposition Sheet).\n9\n Question 23 encompasses felony offenses, firearm and explosives offenses, pending criminal charges,\n10\nUniform Code of Military Justice offenses, and any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. No distinctions limit\ndisclosure to felonies or exclude applicable charges before a municipal court.\n See, e.g., Tr. 108.\n11\n4\nguilty to possession of LSD. As a result of this conviction, he attended Narcotics\nAnonymous (NA) three times a week and submitted to drug testing three time a week\nfor 18 months.  He also notes that the event \u201cturned [his] life around and [he] turned\n7\naway from drugs permanently.\u201d The following year he married and started a family.\nIn December 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with alcohol\nconsumption in public/disorderly persons. He was found guilty and fined $219. On July\n23, 2005, Applicant attended a social gathering of friends and acquaintances at a public\nevent. The township police spotted people with and around Applicant smoking\nmarijuana. The police ordered those in the vicinity to stop. Applicant proceeded to leave\nthe scene.  The police caught up with him and he denied having used marijuana.\n8\nApplicant, however, was arrested and charged under the criminal code with possession\nof drug paraphernalia, possession of marijuana/hash under 50 grams, and resisting\narrest.  He was found guilty of the possession charges and fined $780 by the municipal\n9\ncourt.\nOn December 7, 2005, Applicant completed an e-QIP. On that form, he indicated\nhe had not illegally used any controlled substances in the prior seven years (Question\n24a) and indicated his most recent offense as having occurred in December 1996.  On\n10\nDecember 6, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator. During that interview, Applicant swore: \u201cMy limited experimental use\nof marijuana was the only drug I ever used and I have never used an type of drug since\n1978.\u201d He also signed a sworn statement indicating: \u201cI have never had any other\nadverse law enforcement contact since 1996.\u201d Applicant has since stated that he\ninterprets the term \u201cdrug\u201d to be limited to \u201chard drugs,\u201d not to include marijuana.  At\n11\nhearing, he indicated he no longer uses marijuana, which he often referred to as \u201cpot.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n12\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n13\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\n Id.\n15\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\n12\nburden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate\n13\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision is on the applicant.  \n14\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n15\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\n\n Id.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n16\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n17\n6\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n16\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n17\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct. The Concern: Criminal activity creates\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it\ncalls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.  \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement. The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or\nmisuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions\nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs,\nmaterials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled\nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants,\nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other substances. \u201cDrug\nabuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or\nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nSecurity concerns relating to the guideline for criminal activity arise because\nsuch conduct creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and\nwillingness or ability to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. With respect to\n\n7\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government has established its case. Applicant\nwas arrested for over fifteen incidents dating as far back as 1977 in a pattern that\ncontinued up through July 2005. He was found not guilty in one instance and a couple\nof charges were ultimately dismissed; many of the incidents were heard at the\nmunicipal court level. He still denies the basis of several of the charges. Taken as a\nwhole, however, such facts give rise to significant security concerns and invoke\nCriminal Conduct (CC) Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1, \u00b631(a) (a single serious crime\nor multiple lesser offenses), and CC DC 3, \u00b631(c) (allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted,\nor convicted). Consequently, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate such concerns.\nIn July 2005, Applicant was with some acquaintances at a public event.\nMarijuana and paraphernalia related to its ingestion were in use in the presence of\nApplicant as they gathered. Applicant did not attempt to distance himself from these\nindividuals until the police became involved. He was ultimately arrested and charged\nunder a criminal code for possession of marijuana/hash under 50 grams and\npossession of drug paraphernalia in the summer of 2005. Under these facts, CC\nMitigating Condition (MC) 1, AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence in any of the instances involving criminal conduct that\nApplicant was pressured, coerced, forced, or otherwise inveigled to committing the acts\nfor which he was arrested and charged, obviating application of CC MC 2, AG \u00b6 32 (b)\n(the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are\nno longer present in the person\u2019s life). Moreover, although Applicant has argued his\ninnocence as to the facts underlying some of the charges raised and pleas entered, no\nevidence was proffered that he did not commit the offenses cited, except perhaps with\nregard to an instance in which he was ultimately found to be not guilty. Similarly, while\nhe has stated that some of his arrests were in error, with him being incorrectly cited as\nthe accused, there is no evidentiary proffer supporting such claims. Therefore, CC MC\n3, AG \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) does not apply.\nThe facts show certain charges were dismissed in a few instances, and he was\nfound not guilty in another. He maintains his innocence with regard to some charges,\nbased on circumstances or confusion with another individual. Casting aside even those\nacknowledged arrests, Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct is lengthy. His proximity to\nillegal conduct, illegal substances, and those who use them is pervasive. Applicant\nstates that his 1996 arrest turned his life around. This may be true and it may have\nhelped turn his energies toward his employment, community, and family. It has not,\nhowever, extracted him from situations in which criminal or illegal behavior is being\nmanifested. Such continued behavior and interactions, especially following such an\nextensive period of criminal conduct, creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. I have considered the remaining CC MCs and find that none of them\napply. Consequently, security concerns remain.\n\n Guideline H cites to the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, as amended, in its reference to marijuana and\n18\ncannabis as mood and behavior altering substances.\n8\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug such as marijuana  can raise questions about an\n18\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability or willingness to comply with the law.\nMarijuana is an illegal drug and is specifically referenced in Guideline H. Applicant\nadmittedly used marijuana from at least the early 1980s through at least 1996, when he\nturned over the marijuana he shared with his girlfriend to the police. Since that time,\nApplicant states he has been drug free, despite the fact he has been arrested in the\npresence of drugs, in the presence of those using drugs, and in possession of both\ndrugs and drug paraphernalia. Regardless, Drug Involvement (DI) DC 1, AG \u00b6 25(a)\n(any drug abuse) and DI DC 3, AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia) apply. With disqualifying conditions thus established, the burden\nshifts to Applicant to mitigate related security concerns.\nApplicant stated he has not used drugs in over a decade. In 2005, however, he\nwas found guilty of possession of marijuana/hash and drug paraphernalia. His recent\nproximity to the drug, however, sustains the cloud of doubt as to the extent of his\ncurrent involvement with drugs, thereby raising concerns regarding his trustworthiness\nand willingness to comply with the law. Consequently, DI MC 1, AG \u00b6 26(a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nIn December 2006, Applicant signed a sworn statement before an OPM\ninvestigator indicating he had not used drugs since 1978. His testimony at the\nNovember 2007 hearing showed he turned over marijuana that he and his girlfriend\nused to the police a number of years after 1978, indicating he did not quit using drugs in\n1978. Consequently, it is difficult to assess his veracity when, at the hearing, Applicant\nstated he does not currently use drugs and referenced his intent not to use drugs in the\nfuture. Indeed, the available mitigating conditions demand more than flat statements: DI\nMC 2, AG \u00b6 26(b) actually requires a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the\nfuture, such as: 1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 2) changing\nor avoiding the environment where drugs are used; 3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; 4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation. Applicant has not shown he has disassociated himself with any of his\nformer drug-using friends or venues, nor has he shown that he has signed a statement\nof intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any future violation(s). Finally, he\nwas last involved in a drug-related criminal incident which could be indicative of drug\nuse in the summer of 2005. Consequently, DI MC 2, AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply, nor\ndoes DI MC 3, AG \u00b6 26(c) or DI MC 4, AG \u00b6 26(d).  As a result, security concerns\nremain unmitigated.\n\n In testifying with regard to his 1996 arrest, Applicant conceded he was \u201cstill doing drugs back then, you\n19\nknow, smoking pot.\u201d In so stating, Applicant demonstrated that he does not necessarily distinguish between\nillegal drugs and marijuana, despite his present argument that illegal drugs denote to him \u201chard drugs\u201d and\nexclude marijuana or \u201cpot.\u201d This distinction is particularly troubling given the frequency of his arrests for\ninfractions of the law related to marijuana, a substance commonly known to be illegal, and his interaction with\nthose possessing and using illegal drugs over the span of about 25 years. \n This is especially true given the guideline\u2019s statement \u2013 \u201c[o]f special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n20\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \n9\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Here,\nApplicant certified a security clearance application and signed a sworn statement\nbefore an OPM investigator indicating he had not used drugs since 1978. The facts\nshow that he was involved in some manner with drugs from 1978 through 2005 and,\nwith regard to the actual use of drugs,  he admitted that he turned over to police in\n19\n1996 the marijuana he and his girlfriend then used. Moreover, Applicant swore before\nthe OPM investigator that he had no adverse law enforcement contact after 1996. Both\nin 2004 and 2005, however, he was arrested; in the latter instance, he was arrested\nwhile attempting to leave the scene of a drug related incident. Consequently, Personal\nConduct (PC) DC 1, AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities) and PC DC 2, AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative) apply20\nConsequently, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the related security concerns.\nThe available PC MCs under Guideline E have been considered in light of the\nfacts. In December 2006, Applicant stated he had not used drugs since 1978 and had\nnot had adverse contact with law enforcement since 1996. The facts show that\nApplicant did not cease using drugs \u2013 including marijuana or what is commonly referred\nto as \u201cpot\u201d \u2013 in 1978. They also show that he had two instances of adverse contact with\nlaw enforcement, specifically two arrests and resultant charges. The inaccuracy of\nthese statements subsequently came to light during the investigative process. Given\nthese factors, neither PC MC 1, AG \u00b6 17 (the individual made prompt, good faith efforts\nto correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts), PC MC 2, AG \u00b6 17(b) (the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or\nconcealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate\nadvice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and\n\n10\ntruthfully), nor PC MC 3, AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) apply. Based on the facts of record and\ntestimony offered, there is insufficient basis to find that PC MC 5, AG \u00b6 17(e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress) applies. Consequently, personal conduct security concerns\nremain. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the applicable guidelines and both the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant is a mature professional. He has worked in his area of expertise for several\nyears. Starting as a teen through his late 40s, he was arrested and charged with\nnumerous crimes and infractions. These arrests were for incidents involving a variety of\ncharges ranging from trespass and drunk driving to drug and drug possession. The\nresulting pattern raises genuine security concerns regarding his ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant stated, however, that the drug-related arrest in 1996 turned his life\naround and that he quit using drugs at that time. Yet in 2005, he was still associating\nwith people who possess and use marijuana in public places. His relative ease in such\ncircumstances and continued association with such individuals again raises questions\nabout his appreciation of the law and his own willingness to comply with the law, rules,\nand regulations. This is particularly true given his continued attempts to distinguish\nmarijuana as somehow exempt from classification as an illegal drug, a term he defines\nas being limited to \u201chard drugs.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s misleading sworn statement before an OPM investigator and his\nextensive criminal and drug involvement record raise significant security concerns.\nCombined, they show an established pattern of violations concerning both rules and the\nlaw, and demonstrate questionable judgment. The recency of his last drug-related\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n21\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n22\n Id.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n23\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n24\n11\narrest extends the cloud of doubt created by his past drug use and criminal behavior;\nhis lack of veracity with OPM investigators compounds this doubt with a recent display\nof untruthfulness. \nThe burden is squarely on Applicant to present evidence of refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the prima facie case raised by the\nexistence of criminal conduct, drug involvement, and personal conduct disqualifying\nconditions.  Additionally, he has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n21\nfavorable clearance decision.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n22\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of\nprotecting such information.  This resolution is not necessarily a determination as to\n23\nthe loyalty of an applicant,  but is an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n24\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance. Inasmuch as Applicant has failed to meet his burden and mitigate security\nconcerns arising under the guidelines for criminal conduct, drug involvement, and\npersonal conduct, doubts linger as to his fitness to maintain classified information.\nConsequently, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.t\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a - 3.c\nAgainst Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\n                                              \n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThis 40-year-old security guard, who knowingly falsified three answers on his security\nclearance application (SF 86), has a history of financial problems that continue to exist.  In\n\n2\naddition, he was terminated from his employment in 2001 because he failed a random drug\ntest.  Mitigation has not been established.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The\nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nrequired under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, denied or revoked.\nOn September 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nand elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the basis of the\nwritten record; i.e., without a hearing.  A File of Relevant Materials (FORM) was issued on\nNovember 13, 2006, in which Applicant was informed that any response had to be submitted\nwit/hin 30 days of receipt.  No response was submitted.  The case was referred to me for\ndetermination on December 28, 2006.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The February 24, 2005\nSOR contains four (4) allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant denies\nall four allegations.    \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional\nFINDINGS OF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nApplicant falsified material facts on his security clearance application (SF 86), dated\nMay 26, 2005, in his response to the following questions:\n1.a. - Question \u201c21. Your Police Record - Felony Offenses   Have you ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any felony offense [with a single exception not applicable\nhere],\u201d to which he answered \u201cNo\u201d, and intentionally failed to disclose that he was arrested\n\n3\non October 22, 1988, and charged with attempted murder, a felony; possession of a\ncontrolled substance, a felony; and carrying a concealed weapon, a gross misdemeanor.\n1.b. - Question \u201c22. Your Police Record - Firearms/Explosives Offenses   [Such\noffenses must be reported regardless of whether the record in the case has been \u201csealed\u201d or\notherwise stricken from the court record.]  Have you ever been charged with or convicted of\nany felony offense [with a single exception not applicable here],\u201d to which he answered\n\u201cNo\u201d, and intentionally failed to disclose that he was arrested on October 22, 1988, and\ncharged with attempted murder, a felony; possession of a controlled substance, a felony; and\ncarrying a concealed weapon, a misdemeanor. \n1.c. - Question \u201c24. Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses   Have you ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any felony offense [with a single exception not applicable\nhere],\u201d to which he answered \u201cNo\u201d, and intentionally failed to disclose that he  was arrested\non October 22, 1988, and charged with attempted murder, a felony; possession of a\ncontrolled substance, a felony; and carrying a concealed weapon, a misdemeanor.\n1.d. - Applicant was terminated from his job with Company A on or about November\n1, 2001, for violating company policy concerning company policy regarding drug use after\nhe failed a random urinalysis test. The test results indicated a positive result for\nmethamphetamines and amphetamines.  I find the test results to have been valid. \nPOLICIES\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of six generic factors\nrelevant the conduct, to include (1) Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2). Frequency and recency of the conduct; (3). Age of the applicant; (4). Motivation\nof the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken\nwith knowledge of the consequences involved; (5). Absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6)\nProbability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  I have considered\nall six factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive\n5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the\nultimate question of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an\nindividual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in\nspecific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific\nallegations and/or information are denied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the\nGovernment has the initial burden of proving those controverted facts alleged in the\nStatement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden\n\n4\nof persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within\nspecific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive\n5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is forty years old.  The SCA he completed was signed on May 26, 2006\n(Item 4), the SOR was issued on August 29, 2006, and the FORM was issued on November\n13, 2006.  Applicant responded to the SOR on September 18, 2006, but did not respond to\nthe FORM, which placed Applicant on specific notice about the Government\u2019s concerns.  His\nmost recent statements are thus those that appear in his response to the SOR and the\nattachments thereto.\nHaving carefully considered all of the available information in the case file, I conclude\nthat Applicant\u2019s answers to Questions 21, 22, and 24 are all incorrect and inconsistent with\nthe documented criminal history, and with his submitted documents, specifically Item 3 at\npages 10, 13, 14, 15, and 29.  His discussion and evaluation of these documents, in the cover\npage to his submission (Item 3 at 1) is not supported by the bulk of the evidence of record.\nRather, I conclude, his documents taken together are fairly construed as supportive of the\nGovernment\u2019s position and adverse to that of Applicant.  The language of Questions 21, 22,\nand 24 are clearly and succinctly stated.  Applicant\u2019s explanations for why he answered\n\u201cNo,\u201d as stated by Department Counsel in the FORM, are both inconsistent and illogical.  He\nhad been \u201carrested\u201d on the charges alleged ion the SOR and he knew it (Item 3 at 13, 14, 15).\nI note in Applicant\u2019s sworn statement to an agent of the Defense Security Service\n(DSS) on October 24, 2004 (Item 3), his admission that he was arrested on October 22, 1988\non the charges alleged in 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.  Also in Item 3, Applicant admitted that he was\nterminated from his employment, as alleged in 1.d., because of a random drug test result that\nwas positive for methamphetamines and amphetamines.  Applicant denies he knowing he had\ntaken any such drugs, although he admits taking two \u201cYellow Jackets,\u201d which he describes\nas \u201cover the counter dietary supplements that works as a stimulant.\u201d  He does nor deny he\nwas terminated and offers no evidence that the drug tests might have been incorrect.  In such\na case, Applicant clearly should have answered \u201cYes\u201d and added an explanation, rather than\n\u201cNo\u201d with no explanation.  \n\n5\nPERSONAL CONDUCT: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation. \nDisqualifying Conditions; (2). The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire [SF 86], personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; (3) Deliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a\npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nMitigating Conditions: None that are supported by the record; e.g., (2). The\nfalsification was not an isolated incident, remains recent, and the individual did not\nsubsequently provide correct information voluntarily; and (3). The individual did not make\na prompt, good-faith efforts to correct  the falsifications before being confronted with the\nfacts.\nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant knew and had reason to know that his\nanswers were false. Overall, looking at Applicant in the context of the whole person concept,\nhe has simply not come close to overcoming the evidence supporting the Government\u2019s\nconcerns, as stated in the SOR.  It is basic to the security clearance adjudication process that\nthe ultimate burden of proof is on the Applicant to demonstrate that he is eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.  The record compels the conclusion that he has simply not demonstrated\nhe possesses the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking\naccess to the nation\u2019s secrets.  \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive\nare hereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n \n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.              \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nAgainst the Applicant\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation. \nBARRY M.

Martinez, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 23, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\nDecision at 3.\n1\nId. \n2\nId. at 7.\n3\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen\nBraeman granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because it was made without an adequate evidentiary basis\nand without consideration of important contrary record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole\nperson analysis is not sustainable in light of the record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings: Applicant admitted that he consumed alcohol \u201cat\ntimes to excess and to the point of intoxication from 2000 to July 2005.\u201d   He has had three alcohol-\n1\nrelated arrests between 2002 and 2004.  In June 2002, he was charged with \u201caggravated driving while\nintoxicated,\u201d which was subsequently reduced to DWI.  He had been arrested for passing in a no-\npassing zone and subsequently had a .16 reading in a breathalyser test.  He was fined and ordered\nto attend a DWI class.  He reported this incident to his supervisor.  Although he referenced it in an\nOctober 2002 statement, he did not list it on his security clearance application (SCA) in 2006.  \nIn early July 2002, Applicant was again arrested, this time for \u201cresisting, evading, and\nobstructing an officer.\u201d   He was intoxicated and was arguing with his wife.  When she called the\n2\npolice, Applicant tried to hide from them.  He pled guilty to the charges, paid a fine of $51, and was\nplaced on unsupervised probation, during the course of which he was not to consume alcohol.\nApplicant complied with this requirement.  \nIn April 2004, Applicant was arrested for aggravated DWI, no registration, expired plates,\nand no insurance.  He refused a breathalyser test.  He pled guilty to DWI, and the court dropped the\nother charges.  Applicant was fined $350, ordered to attend an alcohol awareness class and undergo\na one-year probation.  He attended classes at a counseling center.  In February 2007 Applicant\ndecided to stop drinking altogether.  He sought an assessment from a clinical specialist, who\nconcluded that Applicant has \u201ca low probability of a substance dependence disorder.\u201d   \n3\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.23(a).\n4\n3\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel has not expressly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  His contention that\nthe Judge failed to consider significant contrary record evidence will be addressed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge did not consider \u201cimportant contrary record\nevidence\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had sustained his burden of persuasion under Alcohol Consumption\nMitigating Condition (ACMC) 23(b), which reads as follows: \u201c\u201d[T]he individual acknowledges his\nor her  . . . issues with alcohol, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence . . . or responsible use . . .\u201d   However, as Department Counsel\n4\npoints out, Applicant\u2019s efforts to overcome his problem began only a few weeks prior to the hearing\nin his case.  Furthermore, Department Counsel argues persuasively that, in light of Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of alcohol related arrests and continued alcohol abuse thereafter, his one month of abstinence\nand his stated intention to continue an alcohol treatment program begun the same month as the\nhearing are not sufficient to establish a pattern of abstinence or responsible use, as required by the\nDirective.  Indeed, Applicant\u2019s various statements are equivocal as to whether he even acknowledges\n\nSee Government Exhibit (GE) 4, Statement by Applicant, at 3: \u201cI do not consider my past alcohol consumption\n5\nas a problem drinker.\u201d See also Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, Letter from Alcohol Counselor, to the effect that, in the\ncounselor\u2019s opinion, Applicant does not have a problem with alcohol; GE 2, Report of Subject Interview at 2:\n\u201c[Applicant] stated he does not consider himself an alcoholic or a problem drinker.\u201d  Compare these with Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony at Tr. at 54: \u201c. . . I want all of this alcohol abuse and situation behind me . . . that it won\u2019t ever be a problem\nagain.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.23(c).  \n6\nApplicant attended a DWI school after his 2004 incident, but the record is silent as to the contents of this\n7\nprogram.  Applicant did state during an 2006 interview that this program did not entail an alcohol evaluation and that\nhe had never received alcohol counseling of any sort.  GE 2 at 1.  \nDecision at 7.  \n8\n\u201cQ: [In 2002] [y]ou wrote . . . Due to my DUI and my alcohol consumption causing marital problems, I have\n9\nno intention of consuming alcohol in the future.  Did you say that and write that?  A: Yes.  Q: And you wrote that\nintending for the Government to rely upon it in granting you security clearance?  A: Yes .  Q: In fact, you did drink after\nthat day, didn\u2019t you? . . . A: Yes.  Q: In fact, you were arrested in April of \u201804 for DUI?  A: Yes.\u201d  Tr. at 76-77.  \n4\na problem with alcohol to begin with.   \n5\nThe Judge also concluded that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion under ACMC\n23(c), which permits the mitigation of alcohol-related security concerns when \u201cthe individual is a\ncurrent employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of\nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress.\u201d   In this case, the only\n6\ncounseling at issue is that which Applicant began just prior to the hearing.   As it is, there is\n7\ninsufficient evidence to permit a conclusion that Applicant has made satisfactory progress in a\ncounseling regimen proposed to occur over a period of months after the close of the record.  This\npaucity of record evidence as to satisfactory progress does not outweigh the contrary evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s history of security-significant alcohol related problems.  When evaluated in light of the\nrecord as a whole, the Judge\u2019s favorable application of these two mitigating conditions is not\nsustainable.  \nFor similar reasons, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis fails to take\ninto account significant contrary evidence.  She observed that Applicant \u201chas now made a renewed\ncommitment to abstinence.  He demonstrated that he now has the motivation to maintain his\nabstinence and act responsibly . . . He credibly, candidly, and sincerely stated that he abstained from\nalcohol consumption since February 2007 and intended to continue his abstinence.\u201d   Generally\n8\nspeaking, promises of future good behavior are entitled to less weight than \u201ca track record of reform\nand rehabilitation.\u201d  ISCR Case 94-1109 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, 1996).  This is especially so in light\nof the fact that Applicant previously promised to abstain from alcohol during the course of a security\nclearance investigation but subsequently resumed drinking.9\nThe Judge also took into account the favorable prognosis for Applicant\u2019s sobriety contained\nin the letter from his counselor.  However, as Department Counsel has pointed out, the record is not\nclear as to whether Applicant apprised the counselor of his entire history of alcohol difficulties.\nFurthermore, the Board notes the following language in the letter: \u201cIn my professional opinion,\n[Applicant] does not have a problem with alcohol . . . I believe that in the near future, [Applicant]\n\nAE A at 1.  \n10\nTr. at 54.  \n11\n5\nwill not have any more legal problems with alcohol.\u201d   The first sentence is not entirely consistent\n10\nwith Applicant\u2019s own testimony at the hearing in which he characterized his prior experience with\nalcohol as \u201ca problem.\u201d   The second quoted sentence does not address the security concerns raised\n11\nby alcohol consumption, which are directed toward impairment of an applicant\u2019s judgment and\nreliability rather than simply whether he can expect to encounter legal problems in the future.  In\nlight of the above, the Board finds persuasive Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision \u201cruns contrary to the record evidence.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun.\n2, 2006).  Accordingly, the Board further concludes that the record does not sustain a favorable\ndecision, whether through the application of mitigating factors or through a whole person analysis\nand that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jean E.

He voluntarily sought an alcohol\nassessment from a professional in the field and additional counseling in February 2007. He was\nassessed as having a \u201clow probability of a substance dependence disorder\u201d and has made a\ncommitment to abstinence. Also, he has a long history at his place of employment where he is highly\nregarded as having outstanding knowledge, skills, and abilities.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on October 23, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleges specific concerns over alcohol\n1\n(Guideline G) based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.   Applicant received the\nSOR in November 2, 2006. He retained counsel and responded to these SOR allegations in an\nAnswer dated November 15, 2006, and requested a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel on January 30, 2007, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The\nmatter was assigned to me on February 1, 2007. Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for\nhearing was agreed to.  A Notice of Hearing, issued on February 22, 2007, set the matter for March\n15, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.\nAt the hearing the Government offered eight exhibits  (Exhibit 1-8) and called one witness,\na special agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to authenticate Exhibits 2 and 3. (TR\n22-33)  Several exhibits were admitted without objection: Exhibits 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7   (TR 13-21; 27)\n2\nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s counsel did object to two pages of Exhibit 3 as he stated pages 3 and\npart of page 4 reported an incident that was not identified with his client; based on that proposition3\nparts of those two pages were not admitted into evidence; and the remainder of the Exhibit 3 was\nadmitted.  (TR 30-33)  He also objected  to two pages of Exhibit 8, a military police report from\n4\n2002; however, I overruled his objection as Applicant had admitted that allegation; and I admitted\n\n3\nExhibit 8 into evidence.  (TR 19-20; 30-33)  \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through C. Government\u2019s counsel made a\nhearsay objection to Exhibit A, which was overruled, all the documents, Exhibits A through C,  were\nadmitted into evidence. (TR 43-44)  The transcript (TR) was received on March 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:\n  \nApplicant, 46 years old, has been employed as a computer operator by a defense contractor\nin State #1 since May 1981.   He completed a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) which he\nsigned on January 4, 2006.  He had been granted a Secret clearance in October  2003. He has not\nserved in the military.  (Exhibit 1; TR 47-49; Exhibit B; TR 54-55)  Earlier, he had been granted a\nSecret clearance in January 1999. (Exhibit 7)  He took three semesters of computer science at a state\nuniversity.  (TR 46)\nApplicant was married in October 1995 and divorced in December 2003.  (Exhibits 1, 3; TR\n46-47)  He pays child support for his son born in July 1998; and he has partial custody and visitation\nrights.  (Exhibit 2; TR 47, 49)  He has another child who is four; and he agreed to provide support\nvoluntarily. (Exhibit 1; TR 47; 50; 55-56; 81; 82-83)\nAlcohol\nApplicant admitted he consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication\nfrom 2000 to July 2005.  (SOR 1.a.) (Answer)  In 2002 he reported that he began drinking 15 beers\nper week in 2000 at home and became intoxicated on a weekly basis.  He reported he saw himself\nas a \u201cproblem drinker.\u201d  At that point in October 2002 he stated he did not intend to consume alcohol\nin the future while he was on probation.  (Exhibit 4; TR 76-78)   Applicant stated in March 2006 that\nhe did not view himself as an alcoholic or problem drinker.  (Exhibit 2)  However, he did drink again\nduring the period of his separation and divorce.  In February 2007 he again made a decision to stop\ndrinking as he knows his future depends on his abstinence.   He also sought an assessment from a\nclinical specialist and counseling in February 2007 as discussed further below.  (Exhibit A; TR 52;\n78)  \nApplicant had three alcohol-related misdemeanor arrests between 2002 and 2004:\n\u2022\nApplicant consumed alcohol at a friend\u2019s home in 2004 and was stopped for failure to\nmaintain a lane; he refused to take a Breath Alcohol Test (BAT) which led to the arrest for\naggravated DWI; and he spent one night in the county jail.  While his refusal also put his\ndriver\u2019s license at risk, his license was not removed.  (Exhibit 2; TR56-60; 84-85) He was\narrested in April 2004 and charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated, no registration,\nexpired plates and no insurance.  He pled guilty to a reduced DWI charge; the other charges\n\n4\nwere dropped by the court.  (SOR 1.b.)  (Answer; TR 51-52; 60-63)  He was fined $350,\nordered to attend an alcohol awareness class and placed on one year probation which he\ncompleted on May 9, 2006.  He attended educational classes at a counseling center for four\nweeks.  (Exhibits 1,  2; TR 40; 50-51; 62-63)\n\u2022\nIn July 2002 Applicant was arrested and charged with resisting, evading and obstructing an\nofficer.  (SOR 1.c.)  (Answer)  He was intoxicated and arguing with his wife when she called\nthe police; he initially hid from them in a field in an effort to avoid a confrontation with his\nwife and an arrest.  Applicant plead guilty to resist, evade and obstruct an officer and paid\na fine of $51 in August 2002.  His sentence was deferred; and he was placed on unsupervised\nprobation for 180 days until February 2003.  As part of the probation he agreed not to drink\nwhile he was on probation; and he complied.  His deferred sentence was dismissed in March\n2003.  He and his wife were subsequently divorced.  (Exhibits 2, 3, 5, 6; TR 35-39; 49-50;\nTR 70-74; 85-86)\n\u2022\nIn June 2002 Applicant was charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated and passing\nin a passing zone which was reduced to a DWI.  (SOR 1.d.)  (Answer)  That night he\nadmitted having had six beers at a bowling alley, feeling intoxicated, but able to drive home.\nHe was pulled over for passing in a no passing zone.  After he failed the field sobriety test;\nhe reported readings of  .16 and .17 readings on the breath alcohol test (BAT) which was\nover the legal limit in that state, so he received a ticket.  Before his court date he enrolled in\na counseling program and started in November 2002 for three Saturdays.  He disclosed this\narrest in his October 2002 statement, so he did not think to report it again in his 2006 SF-86\n(Exhibits 4, 8; TR 41; TR 64-69) The court ordered him to DUI school and to pay a fine; and\nhe complied with the court order.  Applicant immediately reported this incident to his\nsupervisor; and the contractor filed an adverse information report with the Defense Security\nService (DSS) about this alcohol-related arrest in July 2002 and attached the citation as\nrequired by the NIPSOM 1-302a.  He had been previously granted a Secret clearance in\nJanuary 1999.  (Exhibit 7; TR 49-50; 53)\n\u2022\nApplicant voluntarily returned to the alcohol counseling center in February 2007.  The\nclinical specialist did an assessment on him for a substance evaluation as Applicant planned\nto be in counseling for several months.  After administering two tests and conducting a one-\nhour interview, the clinical specialist concluded that Applicant has \u201ca low probability of a\nsubstance dependence disorder.\u201d (Exhibit A; TR 52-53)\nReferences\nA manager who has known Applicant and his work for 24 years assessed him as taking great\npride in providing the best service required of him to support a hectic schedule.  He  received praise\nnot only from his supervisors and his peers but also from customers.  While Applicant had a period\nof absenteeism when he reported late to work, he overcame this obstacle and has not been late or\nabsent in the last nine months.  His manager attributed these attendance problems to Applicant\u2019s\ndivorce.  He has never been intoxicated or shown signs of a hangover at work.  He concluded\nApplicant is an asset to the company.  (Exhibit B)\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for the past year assessed his knowledge, skills and abilities as\n\n       22. Disqualifying Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:\n5\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  (b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting\nfor work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. (c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment,  regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent. (d) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\n5\noutstanding.  Applicant has earned a \u201cvery good performance evaluation during this past year.\u201d\n(Exhibit C)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or\nabsence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the\nevidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth\nbelow:\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\n21. The Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s problem drinking and his\nthree alcohol-related arrests in 2002 and 2004.  Applicant\u2019s conduct falls within disqualifying\nconditions (DC) (a) :  Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the\n5\n\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or\nalcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program; (f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of  an alcohol\nrehabilitation program; (g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation,\ntreatment, or abstinence.  \n       While not alleged in the SOR, Department Counsel raised concerns over Applicant\u2019s failure to report\n6\nhis 2002 incidents on his 2006 SF-86. As Applicant had promptly reported his June 2002 arrest to\nhis supervisor; and an adverse information report had been submitted to DSS, it was reasonable for\nhim to conclude the incident was already included in his file.  He had no intent to falsify, and no such\nallegation was made in the SOR.  After a DSS investigation he was granted a security clearance\ndespite these two alcohol-related 2002 arrests in October 2003. \n       23. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  (a) so much time has passed, or the\n7\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individuals current\u2019 reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement; (b) the\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken\nto overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible\nuse (if an alcohol abuser); (c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress; (d)\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired after-care requirements, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption\n6\ninfluence. His first two arrests occurred within one month in 2002 when he and his wife were have\nmarital difficulties which later led to their divorce in December 2003.  With respect to the June 2002\ncharge  he pleaded guilty to DWI and followed the court order to pay and fine and enroll in alcohol\n6\ncounseling which he completed.  After his guilty plea to the July 2002 incident, he paid and fine and\nserved probation which he successfully completed, including an agreement not to drink.  After that\ncharge was dismissed in March 2003, he returned intermittently to drinking to excess.  This conduct\nled to a third arrest in April 2004 away from work.  He made a decision to drive home from his\nfriend\u2019s home and was arrested and charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated, later reduced\nto a DWI charge, to which he pleaded guilty.  His plea to a reduced charge led to a sentence of one\nyear\u2019s probation which he completed in May 2006.  He attended the required alcohol education\nsessions as well as paid a fine of $350. \nApplicant has never been diagnosed with an alcohol abuse problem.  After each arrest he\ntestified he completed the required alcohol education and has complied and abstained from drinking\nwhile on probation.   In February 2007 he returned to a counselor for additional sessions.  This\nclinical specialist at a counseling session assessed him as having \u201ca low probability of a substance\ndependence disorder.\u201d He concluded Applicant\u2019s problem drinking was linked to his divorce and the\nperiod thereafter where he was adjusting to a new lifestyle.  \nSignificantly, he has retained the confidence of two supervisors who provided positive\nassessments of his work performance and work ethics.  They have seen no evidence of alcohol at\nwork and he has corrected his absenteeism issues and is rated an outstanding employee.\nConsequently, I conclude that Applicant mitigated these alcohol-related security concerns as he\nprovided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he falls within mitigating conditions.   Under MC\n7\n\nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization, and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified  medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.\n       Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\n8\nGuidelines  \u00b6 2(a):  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of the participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.  (AG 2. Adjudication Process)\n7\n(b), while not officially diagnosed, Applicant has acknowledged issues with alcohol abuse and\nprovided evidence of his actions taken to overcome this problem.  He has fully complied with the\ncourt orders to take alcohol-awareness classes and, equally significant, in February 2007 he made\na commitment to abstinence from alcohol and again voluntarily sought alcohol counseling.  He\ncompleted his probation for his last arrest in 2006 as he complied with the court requirements with\nrespect to a required alcohol-education course after his 2004 arrest and guilty plea.  He now is\nvoluntarily again in an alcohol education and counseling program. Thus, I conclude he established\nMC (c), the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment\nprogram.  While he does have a history of previous alcohol education courses and was rearrested,\nhe has a favorable assessment from the clinical specialist at the counseling program in 2007.  A\nclinical specialist did an assessment on him for a alcohol substance evaluation as Applicant planned\nto be in counseling for several months.  After administering two tests and conducting a one-hour\ninterview, the clinical specialist concluded that Applicant has \u201ca low probability of a substance\ndependence disorder.\u201d  Overall, Applicant has demonstrated positive changes in behavior. \nTo his credit, Applicant never demonstrated any alcohol-related concerns at work.  Two\nsupervisors highly praised his reliability and performance which is also viewed favorably by co-\nworkers and customers.  To his credit there is no evidence of any new alcohol-related problems\noutside of work in the three years since his April 2004 arrest.  He has demonstrably reformed his\nconduct.\nAlso I see favorable indicators in assessing him under the whole person  adjudicative process\n8\nguidelines.  While the past alcohol-related conduct is serious in a mature person, the clinician sees\nthe recurrence of incidents as related to the situation of his separation and divorce.  After Applicant\nfinalized his divorce in December 2003, he had another arrest shortly thereafter in April 2004, but\nhe complied with the probation requirements and successfully completed his probation.  In light of\nthe security concerns raised over his past drinking and alcohol-related incidents, he has now made\na renewed commitment to abstinence.  He demonstrated that he now has the motivation to maintain\nhis abstinence and act responsibility.  I carefully observed his demeanor at the hearing. He credibly,\ncandidly, and sincerely stated he abstained from alcohol consumption since February 2007 and\nintended to continue his abstinence.  To shore up his own commitment he returned to the counseling\ncenter, not only for an assessment, but also to continue with additional sessions.  Significantly, he\nhas demonstrated his reliability at work since 1981 where he is widely viewed as a valued employee.\nThus, after appraising critically the assessment of his expert, I conclude there is little likelihood of\n\n8\na continuing problem with alcohol and/or a recurrence of alcohol-related arrests.  He values his job\nhighly and has demonstrated his commitment to abstinence and rehabilitation.  Thus, after\nconsidering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for  Applicant\non subparagraphs1.a. through 1.d. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",
