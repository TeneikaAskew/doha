Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP) on January 17, 2007. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal\nConduct) and E (Personal Conduct) on June 3, 2009. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nNovember 12, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nItem 1.\n2\nItem 1; Item 4; Item 6.\n3\nItem 1.\n4\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 9, 2009. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations on June 22, 2009, and requested a\ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on July 21, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on July 28,\n2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response or additional\nevidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on October 8, 2009. The government\nsubmitted 29 exhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-29 and admitted into the\nrecord. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and admitted as Item 4.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j,\nand 1.l-1.q of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c\nof the SOR. Applicant neither admitted nor denied the allegation in \u00b6 1.k. Thus, this\nallegation is deemed denied.1\nApplicant, who is 48 years old, works as a computer systems technician for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He has held this position for nearly three years. Prior\nto this job, he worked in other federal contractor positions.2\nApplicant also serves in the Army National Guard. He deployed to Iraq for a year\nof active duty beginning in 2004. He has 27 years of military service, primarily as a\nreservist. He holds a clearance and the record contains no evidence which indicates he\nviolated the rules and procedures for handling classified information.3\nApplicant married in February 1991 and divorced in November 2006. He has one\ndaughter from this relationship, who is 18 years old, and a stepdaughter, who is 25\nyears old. Applicant graduated from high school and received additional technical\ntraining through a higher learning institution.4\n\nItem 6.\n5\nItem 27.\n6\nItem 25; Item 26.\n7\nItem 23; Item 24.\n8\nItem 21; Item 22.\n9\n3\nIn 1988, while in the military, the police arrested and charged Applicant with\ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) after he entered an intersection on a yellow\nlight. The court found him guilty, fined him, and ordered him to perform community\nservice. He complied with the court order.5\nOn July 15, 1994, the police stopped Applicant at an alcohol checkpoint. The\npolice smelled alcohol on Applicant. He admitted that he had consumed alcohol. The\npolice performed a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer test, then charged Applicant\nwith DUI. Although the results of any court proceedings are not in the record, the SOR\nindicated the case was dismissed and Applicant stated in his response that this case\nwas dismissed without prejudice.  \n6\nApplicant and his wife argued often during their marriage. On August 1, 1995, the\npolice arrested and charged him with battery under a domestic violence statute after\nApplicant shoved his wife during an argument. Applicant pled guilty and the court found\nhim guilty of this charge. The court fined him $500, with $400 suspended.7\nThe police arrived while Applicant and his wife argued on July 21, 1996. The\npolice observed Applicant strike his wife and arrested him. The police charged him with\ndomestic violence battery. At his hearing, the court approved him for a diversion\nprogram and required him to pay the diversion fee of $150. He complied with the court\norder.8\nIn March 1997, Applicant and his wife argued again. The police arrested him for\ndomestic violence battery following a complaint by his wife. The police observed\nevidence of violence, not described, on his wife. The police also observed small cuts\nand scratches on Applicant\u2019s neck. The police indicated he was cooperative, but not\nhappy with the situation. Applicant pled not guilty and the court dismissed the case on\nthe recommendation of the prosecutor.9\nApplicant\u2019s former wife worked at a local bar. On the evening of April 17, 1997,\nhis wife\u2019s daughter, who was Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter, called his former wife at work\ncrying. A friend drove Applicant\u2019s former wife to their home. When they entered the\nhome, a fight between Applicant, his wife and stepdaughter erupted. Applicant hit both\nwomen. His stepdaughter sustained a sprained arm sometime during the evening.\nWhen the police arrived, they determined that Applicant was drunk. The police arrested\n\nItem 20.\n10\nItem 19.\n11\nItem 18.\n12\nItem 17.\n13\nItem 15; Item 16.\n14\nItem 13; Item 14.\n15\nItem 1; Item 4.\n16\n4\nand charged him with two counts of domestic violence battery and one count of child\nabuse. The results of any court proceedings are not of record.  \n10\nApplicant voluntarily entered the police station on February 2, 1999 after learning\nthat two failure-to-appear warrants for him existed. Applicant paid the $155 fine and left\nthe police station.11\nThe police stopped Applicant for a traffic violation on April 8, 2000. During the\nstop, the police determined that a NCIC warrant existed and arrested Applicant on this\nwarrant for an incident on January 26, 2000. The record contains no additional evidence\non the resolution of this incident.12\nApplicant appeared in court on February 16, 2002 on a charge of no insurance.\nHe plead guilty and the court found him guilty. The court fined him $800. The record\ncontains no evidence that failure to have insurance is criminal conduct.   \n13\nOn May 26, 2002, the police arrested Applicant for driving with a suspended\nlicense. The police charged him under state law and the local code with a misdemeanor\ncriminal offense. At the court proceeding on June 13, 2002, the local code charge was\namended to a charge of no valid driver\u2019s license. Applicant did not contest the amended\ncharge. The court found him guilty and fined him $78.14\nApplicant and his former wife argued again on September 29, 2002. During the\nargument, his wife threw a child safety gate at him, injuring him. The police arrested his\nwife and charged her with domestic violence battery. He broke a plant and the police\ncharged him with criminal property damage. The prosecutor refused to file charges\nagainst Applicant or his wife.15\nThe police arrested Applicant and charged him with disorderly conduct in June\n2003. Applicant admits this arrest. The court expunged this arrest in 2008.16\nIn December 2003, Applicant\u2019s former wife met her former husband at a local\nbar. They argued. Applicant later entered the bar, walked to his wife\u2019s former husband,\ngrabbed the former husband by the neck, and dragged the former husband across two\n\nItem 11; Item 12. A dismissal without prejudice means that the case can be filed at a future date unless the\n17\ntime to file the charges has expired.\nItem 10.\n18\nItem 9.\n19\nItem 8.\n20\nItem 28.\n21\n5\nbar stools. The police charged Applicant with battery. At court on February 26, 2004, the\nprosecutor recommended dismissal of the case and the court dismissed the charges\nwithout prejudice. The prosecutor did not file the charges later.17\nWhile home on leave in July 2004 from his deployment to Iraq, a family argument\nerupted among Applicant, his former wife, and his stepdaughter over the completion of\npolice paperwork for a car accident. In an attempt to get the attention of his family\nmembers, Applicant threw a pot against the wall. The pot bounced off the wall and hit\nhis stepdaughter in the back, leaving a small red mark. The police arrested Applicant\nand charged him with domestic violence battery. His stepdaughter did not need medical\ntreatment. The results of any court proceedings are not in the record.18\nWhile at a hospital, the police advised Applicant that an outstanding failuare-to-\nappear warrant existed. The police arrested him on this warrant on April 9, 2005. The\nrecord contains no additional evidence on this arrest.19\nApplicant appeared in court on May 11, 2006 for a disorderly conduct charge\nplaced against him on February 19, 2006. Applicant pled not guilty and the court found\nhim not guilty.20\nOn October 2, 2006, Applicant arrived at a location where the police were\ninvestigating an allegation of theft by his former wife. Applicant approached his former\nwife, speaking in a loud voice and moving in an aggressive manner. The police smelled\nalcohol on Applicant and attempted to conduct field sobriety tests. Applicant became\nargumentative and uncooperative. The police arrested him. The police transported\nApplicant to the police station and conducted a breathalyzer. Applicant blew a .062. The\npolice released him without any charges.21\nAlthough Applicant and his former wife were in the process of a divorce,\nApplicant allowed his former wife to live with him temporarily when she needed housing.\nThey argued again for much of the day on November 7, 2006. Near the end of the day,\nApplicant stated he threw his wife\u2019s bag out the door. His former wife and stepdaughter\ntold the police he threw the bag at her and pushed her. The police arrested and charged\n\nItem 6; Item 7.\n22\nItem 6.\n23\nItem 4; Item 6.\n24\nItem 4.\n25\n6\nApplicant with domestic battery. The court found him guilty, a finding he appealed.\nWhile the appeal was pending, the prosecutor dismissed the case.22\nIn his response to interrogatories, Applicant submitted four signed court orders of\nexpungement. A review of these court orders indicates that the four separate court\ncases relate to an incident on December 18, 1999 and a conviction date of August 24,\n2000. The SOR does not reference a criminal incident on this date and the court case\nnumbers do not match any documents in this record.23\nApplicant met with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) on February 6, 2008. At the beginning of the interview summary, the investigator\nwrites that Applicant \u201cprovided information as best as he could recall,\u201d and that\nApplicant admitted pushing his wife away during arguments, but denied ever hitting her.\nThe police report reflects that the investigating police officers observed Applicant\nstriking his wife and arrested him for domestic battery in July 1996. Applicant denied he\nintentionally lied about striking his wife. He told the investigator information to the best\nof his memory on events which occurred many years earlier.  \n24\nIn his response, Applicant stated that he participated in an anger management\nprogram, but has not provided evidence that he did so. He also stated that he no longer\nassociates with the wrong people, whether it is family or friends. His former wife died in\nAugust 2007.25\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n7\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern. In this case,\nthe following two disqualifying conditions are relevant:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n\n8\nDuring his 15-year marriage, Applicant and his former wife fought regularly. He\nalso fought with his stepdaughter. At times, these arguments resulted in calls to the\npolice who came to investigate. The police arrested Applicant six times for domestic\nviolence. During this same period of time, the police arrested Applicant once for DUI,\nonce for criminal property damage, and once for battery. The police arrested him three\ntimes on failure-to-appear warrants and once for driving on a suspended license and\nonce for not having insurance. Finally, the police arrested Applicant on one occasion for\nhis argumentative and uncooperative conduct. The government has established its case\nunder these disqualifying conditions.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 32, Applicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns. The\nfollowing mitigating conditions are relevant:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s last arrest occurred three years ago. The majority of his arrests\noccurred as a result of arguments with his former wife, who is now deceased. Some\narguments included his stepdaughter, with whom he does not associate. Because these\nindividual\u2019s are no longer involved in his life, he is less likely to commit criminal acts by\nengaging in altercations with these individuals. AG \u00b6 32(b) is partially applicable as his\nformer wife is deceased and he does not have contact with his stepdaughter. However,\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not applicable in this case because Applicant\u2019s conduct did\nnot occur under unusual circumstances which will not occur in the future and there is no\nevidence of successful rehabilitation. The concern here is how Applicant will behave in\nfuture relationships given his long history of conflict. Likewise, Applicant has not shown\nthat any of his other arrests occurred under unusual circumstances. \nConcerning his arrest on February 19, 2006, the court found him not guilty of\ndisorderly conduct. The prosecutor failed to file criminal charges for throwing a plant\nand thus, this allegation of criminal conduct is not established. Finally, given the charge\nof driving while suspended was amended to no valid driver\u2019s license, the amended\ncharge is not criminal, but a violation of the motor vehicle laws. Likewise, the finding of\nguilty because he did not have insurance is not criminal, but a violation of the motor\n\n9\nvehicle laws. Thus, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised in SOR\nallegations 1.b, 1.g , 1.h, and 1.i under AG \u00b6 32(c). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern. In this case,\nthe following disqualifying conditions are relevant:\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(b) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that the July 1996 police report indicated the police observed\nApplicant striking his wife and that in his interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant\ndenied ever striking his wife. This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. He  denies, however,\nthat he intentionally lied to the investigator about striking his wife. When a falsification\nallegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving the omission was\ndeliberate. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\nApplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge\nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the\nomission occurred. For AG \u00b6 16(b) to apply, the government must establish that\nApplicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\n\n10\nAt the beginning of the summary of the meeting with Applicant, the OPM\ninvestigator noted that Applicant provided information to the best of his recollection.\nApplicant\u2019s denial that he ever struck his former wife conflicts with the police report in\nJuly 1996. Applicant and his former wife fought many times during their 15-year\nmarriage. His failure to remember the details of each argument over this long period of\ntime is  reasonable. From the beginning of his interview, Applicant made it clear he was\ngiving his best recollection. His failure to recall this event does not equate to intentional\nconduct. The government has not established that Applicant intentionally lied in his\ninterview with the OPM investigator.  Allegation 2.a of the SOR is found in favor of\nApplicant.\nThe government has established a security concern under Guideline E for SOR\nallegations 2.b and 2.c. Applicant\u2019s argumentative conduct during his 15-year marriage\nand with the police raise a security concern about his ability to conduct himself and\nfollow the rules of society. AG \u00b616(d)(3) applies.\n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, Applicant may mitigate the security concerns of the government.\nthe following mitigating conditions are relevant:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant\u2019s argumentative conduct is not minor nor was it infrequent. He and his\nformer wife argued constantly and he argued with others. The arguments arose over\nsimple matters and escalated. He did not walk away or step back from the situation\nwhen the arguments continued or increased in intensity. Rather, he continued to argue.\nHe argued with the police and he fought with a man in a bar. Although the court\ndismissed most of the cases against him without making a finding of guilty, the court\u2019s\ndismissal of his cases does not negate Applicant\u2019s actual conduct. Applicant failed to\nprovide evidence that he successfully completed an anger management program after\nhis divorce. While his former wife is dead and they cannot argue, Applicant has not\nshown that he will act differently in the future in other relationships. He has numerous\ntraffic offenses and two DUI arrests, which also violate society\u2019s rules. He has not\nprovided evidence which would mitigate the government\u2019s security concern about his\npersonal conduct. SOR allegation 2.c is found against Applicant. Arguing with a police\n\n11\nofficer is not a violation of any rules of society; however, such conduct does show bad\njudgment. SOR allegation 2.b is not mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of denying a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of granting a\nsecurity clearance. In reaching this conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this\ncase. Applicant has served in the military on active duty and in the military reserves for\n27 years. During much of this time, he has held a security clearance without violating\nthe rules and procedures for handling classified information. He works regularly and\nthere is no evidence that he has problems at work. This positive information, however,\ndoes not negate his long history of conflict with his former wife. He was unable to\nremove himself from arguments when they arose and before the disputes became\nphysical. This failure resulted in numerous arrests for domestic violence and other\ncriminal arrests over a 15-year period. Applicant has not been arrested in the last three\nyears, which indicates a possible improvement in his behavior. His long history of\nrepeated rules violations continues, however, to raise security concerns about his ability\nto conform his behavior to the rules of society in similar situations in the future.\n\n12\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal and\npersonal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations), based on six delinquent debts totaling about $27,217. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 11, 2008. On April \n27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 4, 2009; answered it on July 20, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on July \nDecember 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n27, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 8, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on September 10, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 14, 2009, scheduling the hearing for October 7, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection, and Applicant testified. I kept the record open until October 23, 2009, \nto enable Applicant to submit documentary evidence. She timely submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A and B, and they were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 16, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old technical illustrator employed by a defense contractor. \nShe attended an art institute from March 1992 to March 1994 and received an \nassociate\u2019s degree. She has worked for her current employer since April 2008. She is \nalso self-employed as a freelance graphic designer. She has never held a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant was married in April 1999 (Tr. 31). She and her spouse separated in \nNovember 2007, and for about a year she hoped for a possible reconciliation (Tr. 32). \nAs of the date of the hearing, she was saving money for attorney\u2019s fees (Tr. 41). After \nthe hearing, she contacted an attorney with a view toward filing for divorce (AX A; AX \nB).  \n \n \nFor about 18 months before their separation, Applicant\u2019s husband was \nunemployed for most of the time. She testified he \u201cwould either get fired, or he would \nquit after a month or two.\u201d She decided to separate because her husband was \nirresponsible and would not contribute financially to the marriage (Tr. 39). \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR were joint debts incurred during their marriage, \nand they have not yet reached any agreement on responsibility for resolving the debts \n(Tr. 31). As of the date of the hearing, she had taken no action to resolve the debts (Tr. \n33). She has not sought or received financial counseling (Tr. 35, 42).  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges an unpaid utility bill for $261 (\u00b6 1.a), a medical bill for $307 (\u00b6 \n1.b), a credit card account for $871 (\u00b6 1.c), and an installment contract for camera \nequipment for $1,347 (\u00b6 1.e) (Tr. 27-29). The two largest debts are a line of credit for \n$7,431 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $17,000 deficiency from the repossession of a truck (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f). These two debts were incurred in 2005, before Applicant and her husband \nseparated, and both were connected to his attempt to start his own business to design \nand construct kitchens and bathrooms. The business failed (Tr. 33-35). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant contacted the collection agency for the medical debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. According to her post-hearing letter (AX A), she asked the \nrepresentative of the collection agency about the $307 balance alleged to be due and \nwas informed that \u201cthey did not have any information regarding that balance.\u201d She was \nquestioned about this debt by a security investigator in July 2008 (GX 2 at 7), and asked \nabout it in DOHA interrogatories in February 2009 (GX 3 at 3), and in both instances \nshe indicated she did not know anything about it. The credit report reflects that the date \nof last activity on this account was in February 2005 (GX 4 at 1). \n \n \nApplicant testified her take-home pay is about $2,400 per month. She lives with a \nmarried couple from whom she rents a master bedroom. She drives a four-year-old car. \nHer living expenses are about $1,400, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $1,000 \n(Tr. 37).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThree potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(e) (\u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d). Applicant\u2019s financial history raises \nthese three disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to her to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are numerous and not yet resolved. They occurred under \ncircumstances making them unlikely to recur, because she has separated from her \nhusband, whose irresponsibility was the primary cause of her financial problems. \nHowever, her lack of any meaningful action to resolve the debts, some of which are \nalmost five years old, raises doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I conclude this mitigating condition is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s current financial \nproblems were the result of her husband\u2019s financial irresponsibility, which was beyond \nher control. However, she has not acted responsibly to address the debts. She was \nquestioned about the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b by an investigator in July 2008 and in \nDOHA interrogatories in February 2009, and both times she indicated she would \ninvestigate it, but she made no inquiries until after the hearing. She has not made any \neffort to resolve any of the other debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought or received any \nfinancial counseling. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). This mitigating condition is not established \nbecause Applicant has not initiated any effort to resolve her debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). This \nmitigating condition is not established. Although Applicant has repeatedly questioned \nwhether she owes the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, she has done nothing to \ndispute it. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. She presented herself as articulate, intelligent, \ncandid, and sincere, but she acquiesced in her husband\u2019s business venture and \nassumed responsibility for two substantial loans, even though she knew he was \nfinancially irresponsible. She has taken no meaningful actions to resolve her financial \nproblems.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

In 2002, Applicant retired from the U.S. Air Force as a lieutenant colonel (O-5).

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nNovember 4, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on June 8, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn July 1, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated August 10, 2009. The FORM contained nine \nattachments. On August 13, 2009, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along with \nnotice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nOn September 9, 2009, Applicant responded to the FORM and presented a letter \nwith exhibits. Department Counsel did not object to the material. Applicant's response \nwas admitted as exhibits A through C into the record. On September 30, 2009, I was \nassigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \n1.d, 1.h \u2013 1.n, and 1.t \u2013 1.y. Applicant admitted the remaining factual allegations, with \nexplanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old program manager who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since August 2008. The record fails to indicate if Applicant has a security \nclearance, but he did hold a top secret security clearance when in the Air Force. In \n2002, Applicant retired from the U.S. Air Force as a lieutenant colonel (O-5). (Item 4)  \n \n \nFollowing his return from an overseas embassy position in January 2000, \nApplicant had difficulties with credit card bills being delivered to his overseas address. \nBetween September 2001 and September 2002, he was late paying his credit card \ndebts. (Item 5)  \n \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant responded to written interrogatories. (Item 5) Between \n1999 and 2001, Applicant\u2019s mother2 and mother-in-law each suffered from cancer. Due \nto both mothers being sick, Applicant and his spouse traveled from Europe to the U.S. \nApplicant was stationed overseas and traveling back to the U.S. impacted their \nfinances. (Item 5) In 2001, his youngest son became addicted to alcohol and drugs \nduring his first year in college. Applicant incurred expenses paying for his son\u2019s \nrehabilitation, medical bills, and legal bills.  \n \n \nTwice Applicant has had problems paying his federal income tax in a timely \nmanner. In October 2005 and November 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \n \n \n2 In 2007, his mother died and his mother-in-law has since become handicapped. (Applicant\u2019s response to \nFORM) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \ngarnished his wages. (Item 5) Applicant asserts he set up a repayment plan before the \ngarnishment commenced. The garnishment lasted two months. Applicant also owed \n$19,000 for unpaid 2007 federal income tax. (Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM) He \nasserts he is making $1,200 monthly payments to the IRS as agreed. (Item 3)  \n \nBetween July 2007 and August 2008, Applicant was unemployed. Applicant fell \nbehind on his debts, mortgage, and car payments. Applicant\u2019s September 2009 credit \nbureau report (CBR) indicates he was 60-days past due for June and July 2009, 90-\ndays past due for April and May 2009, and 120-days past due for the 13 months \nprevious. (Ex. 3) The same CBR indicates he has been current on his second mortgage \nfor the months of May, June, and July 2009, but had been 120-days past due five times \nduring the previous year. (Ex. 3) Applicant disputes being late paying his second \nmortgage.  \n \n \nIn February 2006 and May 2007, Applicant was interviewed concerning his \nfinancial situation. In February 2006, Applicant stated all of his student loans and the \nstudent loans for his two children were unpaid. (Item 5) In response to the FORM, \nApplicant asserts the four student loans with the Department of Education have been \nconsolidated into a single loan and the three student loans with a state higher education \nlender have been consolidated into a single loan. No documentation supporting his \nassertion is included in the FORM or his response to it. \n \nA $4,057 judgment by a state higher education lender (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was the result \nof Applicant having cosigned on his son\u2019s educational loan. In March 2009, he stated he \nhad only recently become aware of the judgment. He asserts his son is on a monthly \nrepayment plan. Applicant requested documents from creditor. (Item 5) \n \n \nAs of February 2006, Applicant\u2019s monthly net income was $12,016 and his \nmonthly expenses were $3,325. He asserted he was paying $5,829 on his monthly \ndebts, which included: $3,300 for mortgage, $900 for car payments, $400 payment to \nthe IRS, and $250 on combined student loans. Applicant\u2019s monthly net remainder (net \nincome less net expenses and debt payment) was approximately $2,800. (Item 5) No \ndocuments were presented as to payment on these debts. \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant included a copy of a certified mail receipt \ndated July 17, 2009, showing mail sent to a credit bureau. (Ex. B) Following the receipt \nare two pages asking the credit bureau to update his CBR. Applicant enclosed a copy of \nhis September 2009 CBR (Ex. C) from one of the three major credit bureaus.  \n \n \nApplicant asserts he is making $1,200 monthly payments on the $19,444 federal \ntax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $585 monthly payments on $22,268 owed on a national credit card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $315 monthly payments on the student loans of $12,263 with the \nDepartment of Education ($12,263, SOR \u00b6 1.e, $18,900, SOR \u00b6 1.g, $8,304, SOR \u00b6 1.r, \nand $11,803, SOR \u00b6 1.s); and is making $285 monthly payments on the $15,217 \nstudent loans with a state higher education lender ($7,983, SOR \u00b6 1.o, $2,186, SOR \u00b6 \n1.p, and $3,144, SOR \u00b6 1.q). However, Applicant provided no documentation supporting \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nhis assertion of timely monthly payments on these accounts. No cancelled checks, \nstatements from creditors, bank statements evidencing monthly withdrawals of these \namounts, or other documentation of payment were received. \n \n \nIn his answer to the FORM, Applicant states a number of accounts were in \nsatisfactory status as evidenced by Ex. C. Applicant\u2019s September 2009 CBR lists six \naccounts being reported as paid or being paid as agreed. However, the account \nnumbers listed in his September 2009 CBR are not the same account numbers listed in \nApplicant\u2019s CBR supporting the SOR. There is no showing that the account numbers \nfrom the earlier CBR represent the same accounts in the later CBR. Those six creditors \nare: $2,576 owed on a national credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.i); $3,956 owed on a \nnational credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.j); two credit union accounts of $750 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) \nand $912 (SOR \u00b6 1.w); and two accounts $1,052 (SOR \u00b6 1.t) and $1,231 (SOR \u00b6 1.u) \nfor vehicles purchases by his sons with the same creditor. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the FORM states five accounts were being paid \nsatisfactorily as evidenced by his September 2009 CBR. (Ex. 3) However, those five \ncreditors are not listed in that CBR. Those accounts are: a $753 collection (SOR \u00b6 1.l) \nby an agency collecting for the same creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.j; two accounts $2,733 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m) and $2,077 (SOR \u00b6 1.n) with the same department store; a $1,075 bank \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.v); and $5,340 owed to a university (SOR \u00b6 1.x).  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has paid a $2,151 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a) or a \n$4,057 judgment obtained by a state higher education lender (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In February \n2006, Applicant indicated he was going to investigate the $19,286 (SOR \u00b6 1.y) debt \nbeing collected by a collection agency for a national credit card company.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 2009 CBR lists one bank credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.h) \nas paid or paying as agreed on. (Ex. 3) The account number in the CBR is the same \naccount number in the CBRs supporting the SOR. \n \n \nA summary of the 25 debts asserted in SOR follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na Judgment. \nDebt denied by \nApplicant.  \n$2,151 \nApplicant asserts this was settled in July 2008. \nApplicant presented no evidence of settlement or \npayment. \nb Judgment by \nstate higher \neducation \nstudent loan. \n$4,057 \n \nUnpaid.

C) \n \n \n$158,118 \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant had two unpaid judgments, a federal tax lien, and 21 other \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $158,000. He has provided insufficient \ndocumentation to show significant progress resolving any of his debts, except on the \ndebt listed in SOR & 1.h. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by the \nexpense of helping his mother and mother-in-law during their illnesses. Between 1999 \nand 2001, Applicant\u2019s mother and mother-in-law each suffered from cancer, which \nrequired Applicant and his spouse to return to the U.S. This travel impacted on his \nfinances. Additionally, in 2001, Applicant incurred expenses paying for his son\u2019s \nrehabilitation, medical bills, and legal bills.  \n \nSome of the bills related to his relatives may have occurred under circumstances \nunlikely to recur. However, his 25 delinquent debts are both numerous and recent, as \nthey remain unpaid. These unexpected expenses related to his relatives occurred eight \nyears ago. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nIn addition to the expenses related to his relatives, Applicant was unemployed \nJuly 2007 and August 2008. Under AG & 20(b), these are conditions largely beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. However, AG & 20(b) has limited applicability because Applicant\u2019s \nlatest CBR indicates he was frequently 60-days, 90-days, and 120-days past due on \nboth his first and second mortgages during the last 18 months. Applicant disputes being \nlate paying his mortgages; however, he provided no documentation showing his \npayments were timely made during the last year. I fail to find Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances when he failed to make timely mortgage \npayments.  \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply because there is no showing Applicant received \nfinancial counseling and there is no clear indication that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent CBR (Ex. C) indicates the debt listed in SOR & 1.h is \nbeing paid as agreed. His recent CBR fails to support that any of the other financial \nobligations listed in the SOR are being paid as agreed. Applicant asserts, but fails to \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \ndocument, that he is making timely, monthly payments to four creditors, which relates to \nnine of the 25 listed delinquent obligations. He provided no cancelled checks, no letters \nfrom the creditors, no monthly bank account statements showing monthly withdrawals \nfor the amounts in question, no monthly account balances from the creditors showing \nthe balance owed is being reduced, or proof that he is making timely payments. AG & \n20(d) does not apply except to the debt listed in SOR & 1.h. \n \nApplicant disputes a number of the debts. AG & 20(d) does not apply. Applicant \nhas failed to show he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of those debts. \nNor this he provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of any dispute.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. During the past ten years, Applicant \nhas experienced some expenses beyond his control. Those expenses, related to his \nmother, mother-in-law, and son, together with his year of unemployment, were events \nbeyond his control. He asserts a number of the debts have been paid and he is making \npayment on additional debts. However, he provided no documentation supporting his \nassertions. There is no evidence he has made any payments or paid any debts, except \nfor the debt listed in SOR & 1.h. He has more than $150,000 in delinquent debt that he \nhas failed to adequately address.  \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1y: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On February 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item 1) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on March 17, 2009, (Item 4A).\nShe thereafter filed a supplemental answer on April 9, 2009, (Item 4B), in which she\nrequested that her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn May 12 , 2009, Department Counsel issued the Department's written case. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and\nshe was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\n\n2\nextenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on June 18, 2009. Applicant did not\nsubmit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on\nAugust 5, 2009.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Items 1-\n8). No documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted every SOR allegation. The admitted allegations\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the FORM, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 41 years old. She is employed by a defense contractor, and she\nseeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nsector.\nThe SOR lists 13 allegations regarding overdue debts totaling approximately\n$156,400, under Adjudicative Guideline F. As stated above, Applicant has admitted that\nshe owed each debt listed in the SOR. There is no indication from the evidence that any\nof these debts has been completely resolved or that any payments have been made on\nany of these debts. All of the allegations will be reviewed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $623.\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $264.\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $121.\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $640.\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $6,301.\n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $148. \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $121,000 for a\ndefaulted mortgage.  \n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $20,552.\n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,290. \n\n3\n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $37.\n1.k. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $60. \n1.l. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $412.  \n1.m. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,984.  \nIn her RSOR, Applicant explained that she had several reasons for her\nindebtedness. In October 2005, she was forced to resign from full time employment\nbecause her mother, who was watching Applicant\u2019s children, also had to care for\nApplicant\u2019s grandparents, who were ill, and it became too much of a strain on her\nmother.  She took a part time position which decreased her income, and because of a\nbusiness slowdown, she was ultimately laid off from her part time job in October 2008.\nAdditionally, she and her husband separated in 2007, ultimately divorcing, and she was\nleft with a mortgage for her home that he was unable to afford, along with additional bills\nthat were overdue.  Finally, she attempted to sell her home for over one year, but she\nwas not able to find a buyer for her home, and it was foreclosed in June 2007. \nApplicant wrote in her RSOR, \u201cWhen I first saw the credit report, I attempted to\ncontact some of the creditors, but was not successful in getting their assistance . . . I\nlook forward to the day when I am able to repay them.\u201d \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement, she has had a net\nmonthly remainder of $340, since at least December 2008 (Item 6).  However, no\nevidence has been introduced to show that Applicant has taken any steps to work with\nany of these creditors to make payments on these overdue debts, to contact any credit\ncounseling organization, or taken any other action to resolve her financial difficulties.\nIn her RSOR, Applicant submitted three very positive character letters from\nindividuals, who have known her in her employment capacity.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n        Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\n        The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt, and she\nhas unable to resolve any of her financial obligations for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above, the\nfinancial problems seem to have arisen primarily because of Applicant\u2019s\nunderemployment and unemployment, and the separation from her husband, problems\nbeyond her control. However,  there is no evidence that Applicant has acted responsibly\nby contacting the creditors since she has had her current employment position and\nattempting to pay off these debts, nor has there been any indication that she has\nattempted to obtain financial counseling to help her become more fiscally solvent.\nTherefore, this mitigating condition does not apply. I also find that no other Mitigating\nCondition is applicable in this case.\n I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial concerns of the SOR\nor is more financially sound and better prepared for future contingencies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why no Mitigating Conditions apply, together with extremely limited\ninformation to consider about Applicant\u2019s character, I find that the record evidence\n\n6\nleaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\n       Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\n       In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nElizabeth L. Newman, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 17, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.41(a) mitigates Guideline M security concerns when \u201cso much time has elapsed since the\n1\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment[.]\u201d The analogous provision under Guideline E is found\nat Directive \u00b6 E2.17(c): \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement[.]\u201d\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information\nTechnology Systems) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 11, 2010,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions; whether the Judge properly applied the whole-person factors;\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no\nerror, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a\ngovernment contractor performing duties in \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d and data integration.  Decision\nat 3.  \nHe began working for a previous employer in June 2006.  When he began working for the\nearlier employer, Applicant was presented a handbook outlining company policy on a variety of\nthings.  Included among the various policy statements was one that forbad the use of a company-\nissued computer to access pornographic web sites.  Applicant signed an acknowledgment that he\nunderstood the policies contained in the handbook.\nApplicant received an interim security clearance in May 2007 and a security clearance the\nfollowing September.  That same month, he was named Assistant Facility Security Officer (AFSO)\nand, in October 2007, Facility Security Officer (FSO) for his previous employer.    \nBetween September/October 2006 until the end of 2007, Applicant used a company-issued\nlaptop computer to access pornographic web sites.  He downloaded approximately 12 movie files,\nwhich were pornographic in nature.  Although he used a company computer, Applicant only viewed\nthe prohibited web sites from his home.  The pornographic images were of adults.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge should have found the security concerns to have been\nmitigated under both Guideline M and Guideline E.  Specifically, he cites to a single mitigating\ncondition under each Guideline, which embody roughly similar criteria.   He argues that the Judge\n1\nshould have concluded that the misconduct in question was not recent and that it will not recur.\n\nSee Tr. at 121: \u201cWhen is the last time you viewed any sort of internet pornography using a work resource?  A:\n2\nProbably November of 2007.\u201d  Compare with Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant acquired an interim clearance in May 2007\nand became an AFSO in September of that year.  \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-15308 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2005), in which the SOR had alleged that an\n3\napplicant had downloaded pornography using his employer\u2019s computer resources.  The applicant contended that the\nJudge erred by failing to give sufficient weight to record evidence that he had been terminated from his employment due\nto a personality conflict with a human resources official.  The Board sustained the Judge\u2019s conclusion that this matter\nwas not relevant to the security concerns arising from the applicant\u2019s misuse of his employer\u2019s computer system.\nCompare, also, ISCR Case No. 07-15281 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 16, 2009): \u201cThere is no prohibition in the Directive against\nconsidering security-related conduct merely because a previous employer chose not to pursue it in a particular forum.\u201d\n3\nAdditionally, Applicant argues that the misconduct, as alleged under Guideline M, does not rise to\nthe level of seriousness as that described in the Adjudicative Desk Reference (ADR).  \nOn this latter point, it is well settled that Judges must decide cases based on the current\nGuidelines and not on the ADR.  \u201cThe [ADR] itself contains language indicating that it may not be\ncited as authority for denial or suspension of access.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 08-01583 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec.\n4, 2009).  Therefore, Applicant\u2019s reliance on this document is misplaced, and we resolve that aspect\nof the appeal adversely to him.\nIn evaluating the mitigating conditions cited by Applicant, the Judge noted that the\nmisconduct in question occurred on multiple occasions over more than a year\u2019s time.  Additionally,\nit occurred with Applicant\u2019s knowledge of company policy regarding internet access.  The Board also\nnotes record evidence (including Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR) and the Judge\u2019s findings that\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct continued until the end of 2007, making plausible an inference that he\naccessed pornographic web sites on a company computer while holding at least an interim security\nclearance and while serving as an ASFO and/or FSO.   The Judge\u2019s conclusions under the mitigating\n2\nconditions at issue in this appeal are sustainable.   \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider, or that he mis-weighed, record evidence\nwhich he believes pertinent to a proper whole-person analysis.  He cites evidence (1) purporting to\ndemonstrate that Applicant\u2019s previous employer violated part of Applicant\u2019s employment contract;\n(2) that the employer did not file a report concerning an unrelated security violation by another\nemployee; and (3) that the employer\u2019s handbook does not indicate that internet misuse can lead to\ntermination.  We have considered this argument.  These matters have, at best, only a tangential\nrelation to the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s misconduct.   Insofar as they are part of\n3\nthe record, it is presumed the Judge considered them.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App.\nBd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  However, Applicant\nhas not demonstrated that they were entitled to more weight than the Judge appears to have given\nthem.  All in all, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis complies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.  See ISCR Case No. 08-02464 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 16, 2009); ISCR Case No. 05-03948 at 3-4\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  \n\n4\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

He began working for a previous employer in June 2006. When he began working for the earlier employer, Applicant was presented a handbook outlining company policy on a variety of things. Included among the various policy statements was one that forbad the use of a company- issued computer to access pornographic web sites. Applicant signed an acknowledgment that he understood the policies contained in the handbook. Applicant received an interim security clearance in May 2007 and a security clearance the following September. That same month, he was named Assistant Facility Security Officer (AFSO) and, in October 2007, Facility Security Officer (FSO) for his previous employer. Between September/October 2006 until the end of 2007, Applicant used a company-issued laptop computer to access pornographic web sites. He downloaded approximately 12 movie files, which were pornographic in nature. Although he used a company computer, Applicant only viewed the prohibited web sites from his home. The pornographic images were of adults. Applicant contends that the Judge should have found the security concerns to have been mitigated under both Guideline M and Guideline E. Specifically, he cites to a single mitigating condition under each Guideline, which embody roughly similar criteria. He argues that the Judge 1 should have concluded that the misconduct in question was not recent and that it will not recur. See Tr. at 121: \u201cWhen is the last time you viewed any sort of internet pornography using a work resource? A: 2 Probably November of 2007.\u201d Compare with Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant acquired an interim clearance in May 2007 and became an AFSO in September of that year. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-15308 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2005), in which the SOR had alleged that an 3 applicant had downloaded pornography using his employer\u2019s computer resources. The applicant contended that the Judge erred by failing to give sufficient weight to record evidence that he had been terminated from his employment due to a personality conflict with a human resources official.

He has worked with computers since 1998, when he was a sophomore in college and performed software and web site development. After school, for about three years, he managed his own company which dealt mainly with different types of computer systems work, file recovery, web development, and other information technology-related areas. In that capacity, he was entrusted to work in customers\u2019 homes unattended. He later worked as a software sales manager. Applicant has a bachelor of science degree. He is single with no children. In about June 2006, Applicant started working for his previous employer. He was issued a company-owned laptop in July or August 2006, which he used at both his office and his home.

On March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising\nunder Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nIn his April 18, 2009, response to the SOR, Applicant substantially admitted the\nallegation set forth under Guideline M in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a and admitted SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.b in part. With regard to the allegations under Guideline E, Applicant\nwrote that he incorporated his responses to allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b with reference to\nallegation \u00b6 2.a,  and he substantially admitted the allegations set forth under \u00b6 2.b. He\nalso requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on September 9, 2009. The\ngovernment moved for a delay in scheduling the hearing until its witness was available.\nMarch 11, 2010\n\n Motion, dated Nov. 25, 2009; Tr. 12-15.\n      1\n Id,\n      2\n Id.\n      3\n Tr. 16-18.\n      4\n2\nThe request was granted without objection. The parties agreed to a hearing date of\nDecember 1, 2009. A notice of hearing to that effect was issued on November 9, 2009.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel introduced five documents accepted into the record without\nobjection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-5. It also produced one witness. Applicant was\nrepresented by counsel, who offered two documents accepted into the record without\nobjection as Exs. A-B. A witness provided testimony on behalf of Applicant. The parties\nwere given through December 9, 2009, to submit any other documents, but none were\noffered. A transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on December 10, 2009. The\nrecord was closed on December 14, 2009. Based on a review of the testimony,\nsubmissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding the use\nof information technology systems and personal conduct security concerns raised.\nSecurity clearance is denied.\nPreliminary Motions\nApplicant presented a motion in limine \u201cfor an order (1) drawing an adverse\ninference in Applicant\u2019s favor, and (2) precluding Department Counsel from calling\u201d his\nwitness for the government. The basis for the motion was that Department Counsel\nintended \u201cto elicit evidence from [the witness] as to the content of . . . [a] web site\nwhose link he discovered on the lap top and/or hard drive that Applicant turned into him\nwhen Applicant resigned from his position. . . .\u201d  The witness\u2019 testimony was opposed\n1\nbecause the witness \u201cengaged in spoliation by irrevocably erasing these items when he\n\u2018cleaned\u2019 the computer and hard drive, so that they no longer exist and cannot be\nintroduced into evidence.\u201d  Applicant argued that it would violate his due process rights\n2\nto allow the person who \u201cdestroyed evidence to testify, untrammeled, as to what he\nallegedly saw.\u201d  \n3\nDecision on the motion was deferred because the full scope of the witness\u2019\ntestimony was unknown. The parties were advised, however, that the witness\u2019\ntestimony would be permitted and given \u201cappropriate weight\u201d to the extent that it\nclarified the company\u2019s protocols for both cleaning and investigating the contents of\ncompany computers, and explained what he claimed he found on the computer.  In light\n4\nof Applicant\u2019s admission he accessed pornographic web sites \u201cto access pornography\u201d\non his employer\u2019s laptop computer at some point or points between 2006 and 2007,\nwitness testimony was unnecessary to establish pornography was accessed by\nApplicant on his former employer\u2019s computer equipment. The witness\u2019 testimony on\nboth direct and cross examination was ultimately accepted into the record only to\nconfirm Applicant\u2019s admission regarding the types and forms of files accessed on the\n\n Tr. 23.\n      5\n Tr. 21.\n      6\n  Tr. 25. The government conceded that the allegation of child pornography \u201cdoes no longer exist as one\n      7\nof the elements of the SOR.\u201d \n Tr. 79-80. Applicant later testified that he personally acquired an external hard drive for the laptop at issue\n      8\nin April or May 2006, for which he later received reimbursement. He stated that he did not register the hard\ndrive with his employer.

Department Counsel stated, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it matters at\nthis point but that\u2019s probably appropriate.\u201d  In declining to proceed with regard to the\n5\nchild pornography portion of the charge, the government stated that it did \u201cnot believe\nthat there was any child pornography\u201d found on the information technology system at\nissue.  The allegation regarding child pornography was stricken from the SOR.\n6\n7\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old man working in the areas of business intelligence and\ndata integration for a software company that is a government contractor. He has worked\nwith computers since 1998, when he was a sophomore in college and performed\nsoftware and web site development. After school, for about three years, he managed\nhis own company which dealt mainly with different types of computer systems work, file\nrecovery, web development, and other information technology-related areas. In that\ncapacity, he was entrusted to work in customers\u2019 homes unattended. He later worked\nas a software sales manager. Applicant has a bachelor of science degree. He is single\nwith no children. \nIn about June 2006, Applicant started working for his previous employer. He was\nissued a company-owned laptop in July or August 2006, which he used at both his\noffice and his home.  Two or three weeks after starting work, he was also issued a\n8\nhandbook regarding the rules and regulations concerning his use of the laptop which he\n\u201ckind of flipped through.\u201d   Before \u201cflipping through\u201d the handbook, he was \u201crequired to\n9\nsign a form\u201d that he \u201cunderstood the policies\u201d dictated by his employer, including the\nuse of business equipment and internet use.  Applicant denies any specific knowledge\n10\n\u201cof the section having to do with what you could or couldn\u2019t access or download with\nyour computer,\u201d but acknowledges that he had \u201csome general knowledge of what you\ncould or couldn\u2019t use that computer for.\u201d  He assumed there was a policy prohibiting\n11\n\n Tr. 119.\n      12\n Tr. 79.\n      13\n Id.\n      14\n Tr. 81, 116. Applicant testified that he used his employer\u2019s laptop to access pornography from home\n      15\n\u201cabout six times.\u201d Contrast \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times adult pornographic websites were accessed over\nthe 1.5 years (6/06-12/07) of my employment on the . . . computer from my home.\u201d Ex. 2 (Attachment to\nInterrogatories of Jan. 15, 2009) During that same interview, Applicant noted that after reviewing his former\nemployer\u2019s policies, the applicable policy states that a \u201cviolation can lead to disciplinary action.\u201d Id. He does\nnot clarify whether the referenced violation is regarding personal use or pornography. \n Tr. 81-82.\n      16\n Tr. 116-117.\n      17\n Tr. 119-120. No evidence was offered demonstrating Applicant\u2019s home computer\u2019s anti-virus protection.\n      18\n Tr. 99.\n      19\n Id.\n      20\n Tr. 100.\n      21\n4\nthe downloading of internet pornography.  His \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d was that he could\n12\nuse the computer for \u201cwork-related purposes, discretionally for personal use such as e-\nmail or maybe buying something like a book on amazon.com.\u201d  Applicant was generally\n13\naware of policies used by companies regarding pornography access. He knew it was\nnot \u201cokay\u201d to use the computer to access pornographic web sites.   \n14\nBetween September or October of 2006 until about the end of 2007, Applicant\nused the laptop at issue to access pornographic web sites. He viewed the proscribed\ncontent at home, where he lived alone, on at least six occasions.  He estimates that he\n15\ndownloaded \u201cabout 12 movie files,\u201d each consisting of about 500 megabytes.  He\n16\nwould use the work equipment for such materials when he could not access the internet\non his own personal home computer.  Of the movie files, some were downloaded from\n17\nthe internet, while one or more were copied from his home computer onto the\ncompany\u2019s external hard drive.18\nAfter receiving his interim security clearance in about May 2007, but prior to\nOctober 2007, Applicant served his employer as the Assistant Facility Security Officer.19\nIn October 2007, he was named the Facility Security Officer.  In preparation for this\n20\nadvancement, he took an online class \u201cthat was really kind of an orientation to the\nIndustrial Security Program. It wasn\u2019t specific to the Facility Security Officer.\u201d  He also\n21\nreceived instruction from his predecessor. He did not receive specific training regarding\nthe prohibition against using company-owned and provided computer equipment for\naccessing pornography.  \nIn about November 2007, while using his employer\u2019s equipment to surf the\ninternet for satiric web sites, he clicked on a pop-up or advertisement that took him to a\n\n Tr. 82-83, 125-126.\n      22\n Tr. 84-85. In Interrogatories dated January 15, 2009, at Ex. 3, Applicant denied all knowledge of the\n      23\nwebsite at issue and its content.\n Tr. 89.\n      24\n Id.\n      25\n Tr. 91.\n      26\n Tr. 92.\n      27\n Id., Tr. 94 (\u201cW hen you handed it over it no longer had any of the pornographic material or the [potentially\n      28\nracially insensitive internet site\u2019s] material on it, is that right?\u201d \u201cYes. I deleted everything off the computer.\u201d Tr.\n94. He \u201cjust dumped everything in [his] personal files\u201d without looking to see what was in them.

A (Exit Checklist).\n      31\n5\nwebsite he now \u201cspeculates\u201d is or was a website which has a name that can be\nconstrued as racially divisive or offensive.   There, he saw material that could be\n22\ndeemed racially insensitive.  \n23\nIn storing his cache of pornographic materials on his employer\u2019s equipment,\nApplicant maintained two separate sections on his external hard drive: one for work and\none for \u201cpersonal things.\u201d  He never stored classified information on the hard drive and\n24\ndid not receive a security clearance until September 2007.  Before resigning and\n25\nleaving his former place of employment, Applicant \u201cremoved everything from the\ncomputer that [he] was not told to leave on there.\u201d  He specifically left files related to\n26\nthe security office and demonstrative images that were on the internal hard drive of the\ncomputer. As a result, \u201ceverything was returned in the state in which [Applicant] got it.\u201d27\nHis cache of pornography was deleted from the external hard drive, as was material\nfrom the site which could be interpreted as racially insensitive.  By simply deleting the\n28\nmaterial without the aid of a special \u201cun-erase\u201d program or formal \u201cwipe down,\u201d the\nmaterial was not protected from recovery. He was not expecting the machine to be\naudited and was unaware of a policy under which hard drives were or might be\nexamined.29\nAs Applicant prepared to leave the company in late December 2007, he met with\nhis successor for about 90 minutes to review the demonstration images, give him\npasswords, and show him how the programs and laptop worked.  Applicant then left\n30\nthe equipment with his successor. He ultimately received a receipt for the transfer of\nequipment.  Applicant\u2019s last day of employment with this entity was December 28,\n31\n2007. Applicant\u2019s successor was tasked to \u201cgo through\u201c the virtual server images that\ncomprise a virtual computer, including scripts, programs, source code and applications\n\n Tr. 40-41.\n      32\n Tr. 41-42.\n      33\n Tr. 43-44.\n      34\n The lack of existent evidence is irrelevant to the extent Applicant admits he downloaded pornography.\n      35\n Tr. 107.\n      36\n Tr. 123.\n      37\n Tr. 109.\n      38\n Tr. 110.\n      39\n Tr. 128-133.\n      40\n Ex. 5 (Handbook) at 33.\n      41\n Id.\n      42\n6\n\u201cto see what went where.\u201d  As a business practice, it was part of wiping \u201cthe entire\n32\nimage and re-ghost [it] with a new image with updated drivers, updated service packs\u201d\nbefore the equipment was reassigned.  In the process, pornography was found.  At\n33\n34\nthe end of that process, the hard drive was scrubbed of all information, including\nevidence of inappropriate access.35\nApplicant did not know that the proscribed materials had been uncovered until he\nwas interviewed in August 2008 as part of the security clearance process. Prior to that\ntime, he did not disclose or acknowledge his use of his former employer\u2019s equipment to\naccess prohibited material.  \nIn acknowledging his use of his former employer\u2019s equipment to access and view\npornographic films and content, Applicant states that \u201cI think looking back on it, it was a\nmistake. I should have been familiar with the policy, I should have followed the policy.\u201d36\nHe never used company-owned equipment to access pornography in prior or\nsubsequent jobs. In his present employment, the company has a policy regarding the\npersonal use of its property for accessing the internet \u201cvery similar\u201d to his former\nemployer\u2019s policy: \u201cOne of the things that it specifies is you not view pornographic\nmaterial.\u201d  From the time he was granted a security clearance in 2007 until the present,\n37\nno other adverse incidents have been reported.  Applicant does not think his viewing of\n38\npornography makes him vulnerable to blackmail.  A close personal friend testified that\n39\nhe has never known Applicant to be racially insensitive in any matter.40\nThe company\u2019s handbook is 38 pages in length. Under the section entitled\n\u201cNecessary Rules,\u201d one complete page is entitled and discusses \u201cInternet Usage.\u201d41\nInternet connections are identified as being primarily for business purposes.

Under a section entitled \u201cInspection,\u201d it is noted that desks, cabinets, and\n\u201cstorage devices\u201d may be provided for the convenience of employees, but remain the\nsole property of [the company]\u201d and can be inspected by any agent or representative of\nthe company at any time.  Any questions regarding policies could be directed to\n44\ndesignated individuals.45\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n46\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n47\n48\n\n Id.\n      49\n Id.\n      50\n AG \u00b6 39.\n      51\n Id.\n      52\n8\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n49\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.50\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) is the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline M \u2013 Use of Information Technology Systems\nUnder Guideline M, \u201cnoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness\nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.\u201d  It further\n51\nnotes that \u201cInformation Technology Systems include all related computer hardware,\nsoftware, firmware, and data used for the communication, transmission, processing,\nmanipulation, storage, or protection of information.\u201d  The Directive sets out several\n52\npotentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. Here, Applicant admits he\naccessed  pornography on his former employer\u2019s computer equipment through the\ninternet and copied from his home computer while generally aware that such access\nwas prohibited or essentially proscribed under company policy. He then maintained\nsuch files on his employer\u2019s equipment until his departure from the company.\n\n Regardless, in neglecting to read the handbook, Applicant proceeded at his own peril. \n      53\n The only inadvertent activity suggested involves the potentially racially divisive web site that Applicant\n      54\nconceded he may have visited. Inasmuch as there is insufficient evidence that Applicant actually visited this\nsite, however, that portion of the allegation is found in favor of Applicant.  \n9\nTherefore, both Use of Information Technology Systems (UITS) Disqualifying Condition\n(DC) AG \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or other technology system) and\nAG \u00b6 40(f) (introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or\nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, when\nprohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations) apply. With such conditions\nraised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate\nsecurity concerns. \nApplicant admitted he accessed pornography from the internet through\ncompany-owned equipment. He similarly copied pornographic material onto his\ncompany\u2019s information systems from his personal computer. He denies having read the\n38-page employee handbook, of which he acknowledged receipt, but admits that he\nassumed there was a prohibition against accessing pornographic material in this\nmanner.  Moreover, the incidents at issue are multiple in number and occurred\n53\nbetween the autumn of 2006 and the end of 2007. The repeated incidents were\nsufficiently recent and conducted with adequate notice of his company\u2019s policy to raise\nserious concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s judgment and ability to understand and\nappreciate established rules and policies. Such facts and concerns obviate application\nof UITS mitigating condition (MC) AG \u00b6 41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment). \nIn accessing pornography from the internet, and in transferring pornographic at\nhome, Applicant violated clearly enunciated policies regarding the improper and\nunauthorized use of the internet with company-owned equipment. Such policies were\nclearly set forth in the employee handbook, receipt of which he acknowledges. The\ncontents of such a handbook are not optional considerations posed by the equipment\u2019s\nrightful owner or suggestions for professional conduct. They are rules to be read and\nfollowed. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s access of pornography carried with it the very real\npossibility of compromising the employer\u2019s information systems through viruses and\nother internet-bred problems. His access of such material was intentional and not in\nfurtherance of his employer\u2019s mission. It was covertly acquired, deleted, and never\nreported. Consequently, neither AG \u00b6 41(b)  (the misuse was minor and done only in\nthe interest of organizational efficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another\nperson use one\u2019s password or computer when no other timely alternative was readily\navailable) nor AG \u00b6 41(c) (the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was\nfollowed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of\nsupervisor) apply.   Therefore, none of the mitigating conditions apply.\n54\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 15.\n      55\n10\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\u201d   Here, Applicant received and acknowledged an employee handbook he\n55\nchose not to read. In violation of clearly detailed policy regarding the use of the internet\nwith company-owned equipment, he accessed pornography on his employer\u2019s\ncomputer equipment from the internet and his home computer. Applicant failed to\nidentify the dates of such access, but admits the conduct occurred between the autumn\nof 2006 and the end of 2007. That time frame suggests that some, if not all, of that\nmaterial was accessed during this period or at least remained on his employer\u2019s\nequipment until he left his job. It is also significant because between about May 2007\nand late December 2007, he served as his employer\u2019s Assistant Facility Security\nOfficer, then as the Facility Security Officer. Although these facts are not amenable to\nthe situations contemplated in the enumerated disqualifying conditions, such conduct\nraises the general security concerns noted in AG \u00b6 15, above, regarding questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, and dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations that can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information.  \nThe same reasons set forth in the preceding section regarding UITS obviate\napplicability of Personal Conduct (PC) mitigating condition (MC) AG \u00b6 17(c) (so much\ntime has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Moreover, while Applicant now freely\nadmits his misconduct and stresses that his misuse of his employer\u2019s equipment to view\npornography does not make him vulnerable to blackmail, it is notable that this\ndisclosure and admission was not made until after his undisclosed deletion of the\npornographic files and their ultimate discovery. At best, such after-the-fact efforts only\nraise AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) in part. None of the other\nmitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n11\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a well-educated man with significant professional experience in\ninformation technology and computers. At the time at issue, Applicant was in his late\n20s and had worked in the information technology arena since he was a sophomore in\ncollege. He later managed his own business in that field. Applicant admits he accessed\npornography with his employer\u2019s computer equipment. He also acknowledges that he\nsigned a form stating he understood the contents of the employee handbook, but seeks\nto mitigate concerns by stating he never read the handbook before or after its initial\nreceipt. Such facts, however, do not reduce concerns. They only highlight his\nunreliability and lack of appreciation for rules and policies. This is particularly true given\nApplicant\u2019s experience in the field, the fact he was generally aware that such activity\nwas not authorized, and his personal assumption that  there was a policy prohibiting the\ndownloading of pornography.\nApplicant did not simply access and maintain pornography as an idle employee\nby day or unthinking employee at night. He intentionally accessed and/or transferred\npornography improperly in the privacy of his home, away from the workplace in which\nhis activities might be observed. In deleting the material, he did so in a cursory manner.\nHe did not think his employer would ever examine its own equipment. Application of\nprofessional common sense and a skim through the employee handbook, however,\nshould have apprised him that his employer reserved the right to inspect its property at\nany time. Of particular concern is the fact that Applicant accessed pornography while\nserving as a trusted information technology professional and applicant for a security\nclearance who would eventually serve as the Assistant Facility Security Officer, then as\nthe Facility Security Office. In those capacities, he violated company policy concerning\ninternet usage, maintained pornographic material, failed to disclose its acquisition or\nmaintenance, and ultimately tried to conceal its acquisition prior to his departure. In\ndoing so, he demonstrated poor judgment, unreliability, and betrayed the trust of his\nemployer.\nThe way in which the company discovered Applicant\u2019s misuse of its internet-\ncapable equipment is relatively irrelevant. The employer had a right to inspect its own\nproperty. The fact that the evidence has since been scrubbed is similarly irrelevant.\nApplicant freely admitted to his conduct. While he has worked for another company for\nabout two years without incident, insufficient time has passed to demonstrate that\nApplicant no longer misuses information technology systems, fully appreciates\nemployer policies, and follows established company procedures. Given his background,\nprofession, work responsibilities, and positions, Applicant\u2019s flagrant disregard of his\nemployer\u2019s policies, his lack of concern regarding his equipment use, or his general\n\n12\nnegligence raise and sustain genuine security concerns regarding both his use of\ninformation technology systems and his personal conduct. Therefore, it is concluded\nthat security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s access of pornography remain unmitigated.\nClearance is denied. \n  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.b \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.b \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

While Applicant argues that the\nsecond violation is not a felony unless there has first been a conviction on the first violation, there is no evidence in the\nrecord to support his argument.\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant contends that the Judge committed\nharmful error in characterizing Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior as a felony and in mis-stating the date\nof Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior and the time elapsed since Applicant\u2019s offenses and pretrial\nintervention program.  Applicant also argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his\nevidence of mitigation.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings:  Applicant is 44 years old and retired\nfrom the Air Force after a career of over 20 years as a fighter pilot.  Applicant received numerous\nmedals and awards during his service career.  Applicant\u2019s wife was severely injured in an accident\nand died in 2001, leaving Applicant to raise three small children.  Applicant remarried in 2002 and\nhas one child from that marriage.  While Applicant was still on active duty, he entered a store to pick\nup photographs while wearing his flight uniform, and he used his new cell phone to take a picture\nunder the skirt of a female shopper.  The woman challenged Applicant, and he denied doing anything\ninappropriate.  The woman followed Applicant through the store and saw him do the same thing to\nanother woman.  The first woman loudly challenged Applicant and alerted the second woman.\nApplicant left the store while working with his cell phone.  The police were notified, and Applicant\nwas identified through store security cameras and the receipt for the pictures.  A few weeks later,\nApplicant was arrested, and his camera and computer were seized pursuant to a search warrant.  The\npolice discovered that Applicant had deleted the pictures of the two women from his cell phone, but\nhad taken pictures of his wife in the shower without her knowledge or permission.  Applicant\nadmitted to the deletion.  At the request of the police, Applicant called the two women and\napologized.  Applicant stated that at the time of the above behavior, he was under stress about his\njob, because his wife had refused to accompany his to a new duty station, and he knew his refusal\nof the proposed transfer would negatively impact his military career.  Applicant\u2019s wife, her family,\nhis three oldest children, and his supervisors are aware of the incident.  Applicant was indicted for\nsexual voyeurism.  He was allowed to enter a pre-trial intervention program.  After Applicant\nreceived counseling and completed the program, his criminal record was expunged.  Applicant\nsubmitted character references from high-ranking Air Force Officers and from his father-in-law. \nThe Judge characterized Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct as a felony.  Decision at 6.  Applicant\nargues that his conduct was a misdemeanor.  The record supports the Judge\u2019s characterization.1\nHowever, even if the Judge\u2019s characterization were found to be erroneous, the error would not be\nharmful, since the existence of a felony is not necessary for the Judge to make an adverse decision\nregarding criminal conduct.  The Judge can consider evidence that an applicant engaged in criminal\nconduct even in the absence of a conviction.  Here, Applicant admitted the criminal conduct in issue.\nRather than emphasizing the severity of the crime, the Judge focused on the fact that any criminal\n\nactivity \u201ccreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d  Decision at 5.\nIt also \u201ccalls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulation\n[sic].\u201d  Id.  Applicant has failed to demonstrate harmful error in this regard.\nApplicant is correct that the Judge erred in stating that the criminal conduct described above\noccurred in July 2006 rather than June 2006.  However, this error is harmless.  The conduct actually\noccurred on June 23, 2006.  It is very unlikely that a difference of a few days, or even a month,\nwould lead to a different outcome in these circumstances.  \nApplicant is also correct that the Judge erred in stating that only two years had elapsed since\nthe criminal conduct occurred and only 11 months had passed since Applicant completed his pre-trial\nintervention.  In fact, it had been three years since the conduct and 21 months since Applicant\ncompleted the program.  However, Applicant has not demonstrated harmful error.  The Directive\ndoes not define \u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d with\nregard to rehabilitation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-07674 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 18, 2007).  The\nJudge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as\nto the recency of Applicant\u2019s conduct.  A finding that the conduct occurred one year earlier and that\nthe program was completed ten months earlier would not necessarily have led the Judge to reach a\ndifferent decision.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to Applicant\u2019s evidence of\nmitigation.  Even if the Judge had found some evidence of mitigation in this case, that alone would\nnot have compelled the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence\noutweighed the unfavorable, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2007).  \nAfter reviewing the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Young, Jr., Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on June 11, 2008. \nThe security clearance application was submitted because Applicant had recently \nretired from active military service and was commencing work for a defense contractor. \nOn May 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns for sexual \nbehavior, personal conduct, and criminal conduct under Guidelines D, E, and J, \nrespectively. The security concerns arose out of the same two incidents in July 2006. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 26, 2008. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 29, 2009. He admitted all factual \nallegations under the three guidelines. He requested a hearing before an administrative \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 21, 2009, and I was \nassigned the case on July 24, 2009. Applicant's counsel agreed to a hearing date of \nSeptember 2, 2009, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on August 13, 2009. The \nhearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered six exhibits, marked Gov. \nEx. 1 through 6 which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and offered ten exhibits, marked App. Ex. A through J, and received without \nobjection. The record was left open for Applicant to submit additional documents. \nApplicant timely submitted one document, marked and received as App. Ex. K. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 9, 2009. Based on a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations raised \nin the SOR.  \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and has been a military analyst for a defense contractor \nfor approximately one year. He graduated from high school in 1983, and college with a \nBachelors of Science degree in 1987. He has a master's degree in aeronautical \nengineering. He participated in the Reserve Officers Training Program (ROTC) in \ncollege. Upon graduation and commissioning, he entered active duty with the Air Force, \nand served for over 20 years on active duty in the Air Force as an F-16 pilot. He held a \ntop secret clearance, a sensitive compartmented information access, and a special \naccess security clearance while on active duty. He retired from active duty at the rank of \nlieutenant colonel with an Honorable Discharge in May 2008. He is a command pilot \nwith 4,035 flight hours in the F-16. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross, six \nmeritorious service medals, two air medals, three aerial achievement medals, and other \nservice awards. His first wife was severely injured in an accident in October 2000, and \npassed away in January 2001 leaving Applicant with three young daughters. He \nremarried in 2002. He and his current wife have a five year old son (Tr. 25-28, 37-39, \n45-47, 63-67; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated June 11, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, DD Form 214, dated \nMay 31, 2008). \n \nWhile still on active duty, Applicant's wife asked him to stop at a store and pick-\nup some photographs she left for processing. While in the store, Applicant, who was \nwearing his military flight uniform, used the camera on his new cell phone to take a \npicture under the skirt of a female store patron. The female patron felt Applicant's \npresence and challenged him, asking, if he had touched her. Applicant vehemently \ndenied any inappropriate action and moved away from the woman to another part of the \nstore. The woman followed Applicant around the store and observed him take another \npicture under the skirt of another female patron. She again loudly challenged Applicant, \nand alerted the other female patron. Applicant left the store, and was observed looking \nat and working with his cell phone. Local police were notified, and Applicant was \n\n \n3 \n \n \nidentified though examination of the store's surveillance cameras, and the receipt for the \nphotographs that he picked up for his wife.  \n \nA few weeks later, Applicant was asked to report to the local police station. He \nwent to the local police station accompanied by his commander. Applicant was \napprehended and his cell phone and computer seized at his house by the police \npursuant to a search warrant. When the police downloaded the camera phone, the \npictures taken in the store on the cell phone had been erased, but there were pictures \ntaken of Applicant's wife while she was in the shower. Applicant's wife did not know of \nthe pictures, and did not give Applicant permission to photograph her in the shower. \nApplicant admits he erased the picture taken of the women in the store and admits \ntaking the pictures of his wife without her permission after he had taken the pictures in \nthe store. At the request of the police, Applicant called the women and apologized for \nhis actions (Tr.30-34, 69-76; Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, dated January 26, \n2009; Gov. Ex. 6, Air Force Office of Special Investigations Report, dated April 16, \n2009). \n \nDuring the time preceding his apprehension, Applicant stated he was undergoing \na great deal of stress concerning his career. He had been requested to take a command \nassignment at another base but his wife refused to accompany him. He decided not to \ntake the assignment, instead taking an assignment at his local base that would enable \nhim to complete his service career. He knew at the time that these decisions would \nmean he had little if any chance of advancing in rank.  \n \nHis oldest children as well as his wife's family are aware of the July 2006 incident \nand his arrest. He has not told his parents about the July 2006 incident as he sees no \nreason to involve them. Applicant attributed his action to poor judgment. He states he \nmade changes since July 2006. He stated he gave the general officers that still mentor \nhim and are his supervisors his assurance that it would not happen again (Tr. 27-30; 44-\n45, 47-51). \n \nApplicant was indicted by a grand jury for sexual voyeurism. He agreed with the \nlocal prosecutor to being placed in a pre-trial intervention program. He received a \ncounseling assessment that he was eligible to enter the pre-trial intervention program. \nHe completed a counseling program as part of the intervention program. His wife also \nparticipated in the counseling. He was evaluated as stable emotionally, with no basis for \nany psychological diagnosis, and no current or anticipated need for any continued \npsychotherapeutic support. He was further evaluated as fully able to function in his work \nwith no basis for concern that he would be subject to any particular level of duress \nrelated to the incident. The evaluation concluded that there is no clear basis to indicate \nApplicant would be prevented from performing his job in an excellent manner and \nwithout any external limits. No potential for similar behavior was identified. He \ncompleted the program, and his record was expunged (Tr. 57-61; App. Ex. B, Letter \nEvaluation, dated August 31, 2009; App. Ex. H, Order, dated December 30, 2008; App. \nEx. K, Criminal Law, Chapter 22, State statute). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAfter his arrest, Applicant was barred from Special Access Programs, but he was \npermitted to continue with his access to classified information (App. Ex. I, Letter, dated \nOctober 4, 2006; App. Ex. J, Memorandum, dated October 4, 2006). He received a \nLetter of Reprimand from his Commanding General. He remained on operational flight \nstatus until his retirement from the Air Force in May 2008 (Tr. 37-40; App. Ex. G, letter, \ndated June 1, 2009). \n \nAn Air Force Lieutenant General wrote that he has known Applicant since \nApplicant joined his squadron in 1989. Applicant distinguished himself and was an \nexceptional officer and pilot. Applicant also served as his wing man. He notes that the \nincident in question was the result of poor judgment and that Applicant took full \nresponsibility and corrective positive action. He recommends Applicant be granted \naccess to classified information (App. Ex. C, letter, dated August 11, 2009). \n \nAnother Air Force officer wrote that he has known Applicant and worked with him \nfor many years. He also works with Applicant in his civilian capacity since his retirement. \nHe recommends Applicant for any leadership position in industry or businesses that \ncontract with the Department of Defense. Applicant has shown leadership, patriotism, \nand unquestioned performance at the highest level. He has complete trust in Applicant \n(App. Ex. D, Letter, dated September 1, 2009). \n \nApplicant's present father-in-law writes that he has known Applicant and his \nfamily for many years and has been directly associated with Applicant since he married \nhis daughter in 2002. He knows Applicant to be hard working, reliable, and respected. \nHe does not believe Applicant presents any security risk and recommends him as \nworthy of the highest national security clearance (App. Ex. E, Letter, dated August 4, \n2009). \n \nA former Air Force Brigadier General who is Applicant's supervisor in their civilian \ncapacity writes that he has known Applicant for many years. Applicant has a reputation \nfor trustworthiness, loyalty, and patriotism. He knows of the July 2006 incident and is \nimpressed with how Applicant took responsibility for his actions and positive corrective \naction (App. Ex. F, Letter, dated August 10, 2009). \n \nThe Commanding General, who issued Applicant the Letter of Reprimand for the \nJuly 2006 incident, wrote that he has known Applicant for over 15 years and that the \nincident in July 2006 was an aberration that Applicant has aggressively self-corrected. \nApplicant showed strong moral character to make effective corrections in his actions. \nHe strongly recommends that Applicant be granted access to classified information \n(App. Ex. G, Letter, dated June 1, 2009).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n5 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe security concerns raised for Applicant are all from the same incident. \nSecurity concerns raised for sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct \nare the same for each. The security concern involves questions of Applicant's reliability, \njudgment, and trustworthiness. Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense \nindicates a personality or emotional disorder, reflecting lack of judgment or discretion \nwhich can raise questions about the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information (AG \u00b6 12). Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulation (AG \u00b6 30). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPersonal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Since \nthe security concerns are similar, the concerns will be discussed as a group. \n \n \nApplicant admits and the information clearly establishes that he committed the \ncriminal act of sexual voyeurism under state statute by taking pictures with a cell phone \ncamera under the skirts of two females. He also took pictures of his wife in the shower \nwithout her permission but this act is not alleged as criminal activity. It does show a \ncontinued course of conduct by Applicant. This criminal offense establishes the Sexual \nBehavior Disqualifying Condition (SB DC) AG \u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a criminal \nnature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted). The criminal act is a felony \noffense for which Applicant was indicted and establishes Criminal Conduct Disqualifying \nCondition (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses). The \nincident also establishes Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(c) \n(credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for \nan adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered \nas a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulation, or other character issues indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information). \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence by way of court documents, \ninvestigative reports, and Applicant's admission and statements to establish the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 31(a), and 16(c). The burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns \nunder sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. An applicant has the \nburden to refute an established allegation or prove a mitigating condition, and the \nburden to prove or disprove it never shifts to the government. \n \nEach of the alleged security concerns has a similar mitigating condition. These \nmitigating conditions involve the passage of time, the unusual nature of the action \ncausing security concerns, the likelihood of recurrence, and whether the actions cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I considered Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the \ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment); Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SB MC) AG \u00b6 14(b) (the \nsexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and Personal Conduct Mitigating \nCondition (PC MC) AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or \nthe behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment). The incident took place in July 2006, and Applicant was placed in a \npre-trial intervention program that he successfully completed in December 2008. The \n\n \n7 \n \n \nincident took place only two years ago. Applicant completed the pre-trial intervention \nprogram only eleven months ago. Even though Applicant has completed the pre-trial \nintervention program and all counseling, two years is not a long time to establish \nsuccessful rehabilitation for a felony offense. While Applicant cites the stress he was \nunder in July 2006 because of his career choices and issues at the time, there were no \nunusual circumstances causing Applicant to commit the offense. He was not forced into \nthe action and his judgment was not impaired by any substance abuse or other \ncircumstances. While Applicant appears on the path to rehabilitation for his sexual \ndeviant and criminal conduct, he has not provided sufficient information to establish that \nit would not happen again. After being confronted in the store by the women he \ninappropriately photographed, he went home and took inappropriate photographs of his \nwife without her permission. Accordingly, he has not established these mitigating \nconditions for the security concerns alleged. \n \nSuccessful rehabilitation is also a factor to consider in mitigating the security \nconcerns. There is no rehabilitative mitigating condition for deviant sexual behavior. \nHowever, I have considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(d) \n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement); and \nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur). Applicant always acknowledged his behavior to investigative and military \nauthorities, and never denied he did something wrong. He has not been involved in any \nconduct that would raise additional security concerns since the incident in July 2006. He \nsuccessfully completed the pre-trial intervention program, and faithfully attended \ncounseling. These are signs of successful rehabilitation. However under the \ncircumstances that the offense was committed only two years ago and the pre-trial \nintervention was only completed about eleven months ago, it is too soon to determine \nthat he has been successfully rehabilitated. Applicant has not presented sufficient \ninformation to mitigate security concerns for criminal conduct, sexual behavior, and \npersonal conduct.   \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant served \nhis country as a fighter pilot for over 20 years and had a very successful career. His life \nhas had turmoil since his first wife died as the result of an automobile accident in 2002 \nleaving him to raise three daughters. However, he married a woman who was a help to \nhim with the daughters and gave him a son. He betrayed her trust in him by taking \ninappropriate pictures of her without her permission on his cell phone camera. I \nconsidered the letters of recommendation from his Air Force colleagues and general \nofficers as to his trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. I considered his \nreputation for excellent work. I consider that Applicant held a top security clearance \nwhile on active duty with no security issues or violations.  \n \nHowever, Applicant was a command pilot in the Air Force with 4,035 flight hours \nas an F-16 pilot. As such, he is taught to be deliberate, think through, and consider the \noutcome of his actions. He is taught not to be reckless and not undertake actions \ninadvertently. He is taught to be thoughtful and calculating about his actions. Applicant \ntook deliberate actions when taking inappropriate pictures of two women he did not \nknow in a store. He continued this inappropriate course of action even after being \nchallenged by later taking inappropriate pictures of his wife without her permission. This \nconduct shows lack of judgment and discretion. Such a lack of judgment and discretion \nindicated that he may not be reliable, trustworthy, able to exercise good judgment, \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations, and protect classified information. While there \nare signs of rehabilitation, it is too soon to determine that Applicant has been \nsuccessfully rehabilitated, and that sexual behavior or criminal and personal conduct \nproblems will not arise in the future. Under these circumstances it is too soon to \ndetermine that he can be trusted with access to classified information. Overall, on \nbalance the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability at this time for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal and \npersonal conduct, and sexual behavior. I make this determination knowing that \nApplicant held access to top level classified information while on active duty in the Air \nForce with no security violation incidents. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old waste management technician and driver for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant is married, but currently separated from his spouse (see ex. 1; Tr. 39). He has no children from his marriage. Applicant experienced recurrent periods of unemployment between October 2001 and March 2007 (Tr. 25-29). Some of his layoffs were attributable to job-related injuries that affected his work. Others were due to the terminations of his employers\u2019 work contracts (Tr. 22-24). During these layoffs, he struggled to pay his bills and manage his finances. When Applicant was about 14 years of age (sometime in 1985), he received $1.1 million from a trust fund established by his grandmother (Tr. 30-33). With some of the trust funds, Applicant bought a mobile home in 1995 (Tr. 32). He repaid all of his existing debts at the time with other funds he received from the trust. And with the balance of his trust funds, he made large gifts to various family members in need. Because of his employment conditions, Applicant encountered difficulties paying his utilities and making his monthly home loan and motorcycle payments (Tr. 22-23, 30). When he could not make his loan payments on his mobile home, his landlord smashed the unit with a bulldozer and destroyed the unit (Tr. 32-33). Applicant\u2019s inherited tru",

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 25, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 15, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on August\n19, 2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nOctober 30, 2009\n\n2\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and\nfour exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 27, 2009.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access classified\ninformation is denied.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleges in the SOR that Applicant (a)\naccumulated three debts exceeding $2,000 and (b) incurred a federal tax lien for\n$84,402 in unpaid federal taxes.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the alleged debts. He\nclaimed to be making payments on the debts alleged.  \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old waste management technician and driver for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nApplicant is married, but currently separated from his spouse (see ex. 1; Tr. 39).\nHe has no children from his marriage.\nApplicant experienced recurrent periods of unemployment between October 2001\nand March 2007 (Tr. 25-29).  Some of his layoffs were attributable to job-related injuries\nthat affected his work. Others were due to the terminations of his employers\u2019 work\ncontracts (Tr. 22-24).  During these layoffs, he struggled to pay his bills and manage his\nfinances.\nWhen Applicant was about 14 years of age (sometime in 1985), he received $1.1\nmillion from a trust fund established by his grandmother (Tr. 30-33).  With some of the\ntrust funds, Applicant bought a mobile home in 1995 (Tr. 32). He repaid all of his existing\ndebts at the time with other funds he received from the trust.  And with the balance of his\ntrust funds, he made large gifts to various family members in need.    \nBecause of his employment conditions, Applicant encountered difficulties paying\nhis utilities and making his monthly home loan and motorcycle payments (Tr. 22-23, 30).\nWhen he could not make his loan payments on his mobile home, his landlord smashed\nthe unit with a bulldozer and destroyed the unit (Tr. 32-33).  \nApplicant\u2019s inherited trust fund contained mostly stocks and other securities.\nApplicant sold penny stocks from the trust to purchase his home (sometime in 1995) and\nassist his family members (Tr. 31-32).  Because he incurred taxable gains on his stock\n\n3\nsales, he incurred tax liabilities (Tr. 31). The IRS initially assessed $86,000 in taxes,\ninterest and penalties on his gains (Tr. 31).  \nBeginning in May 2009, Applicant initiated $25 monthly payments to the IRS (Tr.\n33-35). He made two payments to the IRS in May and July 2009, respectively (see ex. A;\nTr. 35).  Not satisfied with his minimal monthly payments, the IRS asked him for a\ndetailed accounting of his monthly expenses in August 2009 (Tr. 35). Applicant\nresponded by making a $50 payment to the IRS on the date of the hearing (Tr. 35-36).\nIn the coming week (i.e., the week of August 24, 2009), the IRS scheduled the\ncommencement of garnishment action on Applicant\u2019s wages (Tr. 36).  Under the terms of\nthe IRS garnishment letter, the IRS will take $2,000 a month out of Applicant\u2019s wages,\nleaving him with just $800 a month to live on (Tr. 67-68). Without identifying the tax\nyears, the garnishment letter confirmed that Applicant owed $100,000 in back federal\ntaxes, interest, and penalties (Tr. 69).  He has no tax advocate or tax professional to\nassist him with his taxes.\nTo date, Applicant has made just three payments (totaling $100) towards\nsatisfying his tax debt (see ex. A; Tr. 35-36, 54-55, 58).  He has received no tax or other\nfinancial counseling and has no viable employment options to supplement his income\nand address his other debts (Tr. 46, 68).  \nBesides his tax delinquencies, Applicant accrued three smaller delinquent debts:\na utility debt (creditor 1.a), a veterinarian bill (creditor 1.b), and an ambulance bill\n(creditor 1.c).  Two of these debts (creditors 1.a and 1.c) were purchased by the same\ncollection firm and have been consolidated into one monthly payment of $50.00 (see ex.\nC). To date, Applicant documents two payments to creditors 1.a and 1.c in the respective\namounts of $50 each (see exs. B through D; Tr. 52-53, 59-60). Applicant has not\nprovided any documented payments to his remaining creditor (creditor 1.b), despite his\nstated commitment to satisfy this disputed debt (Tr. 22-23).\nApplicant nets approximately $2,000 a month (Tr. 39). His monthly expenses\ninclude his rent ($250), utilities ($75 to $100), cell phone ($125), car payments ($200),\ncar insurance ($25), and gas for his truck ($100 to $150).  He currently has no health\ninsurance or medical expenses; his medical bills are all covered by his employer (Tr. 41).\nHe has no bank account or 401(k) retirement account (Tr. 44, 47). His spouse\ncontributes nothing to his monthly expenses.  By contrast, he has provided material\nfinancial support to her, albeit nothing since January 2009 (Tr. 39-41).\nIn 2007 Applicant was involved in an employment-related accident (Tr. 45-46).\nHe incurred medical bills in connection with the accident that his employer covered,\nexcept for the ambulance bill identified in the SOR (Tr. 46). \nApplicant has encouraging endorsements from members of his employer group.\nHis direct supervisor has known him since 1997 and describes his life as a \u201clittle\nscattered\u201d (Tr. 63).  She credited him with making earnest efforts to reconcile his tax\nproblems with the IRS (Tr. 63).  She described Applicant as a very important asset to\n\n4\ntheir company, which is located in a very small rural town that has limited labor\nresources (Tr. 70).  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \"[c]onditions\nthat could mitigate security concerns,\u201d if any. These guidelines must be considered\nbefore deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or\ndenied.  Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 2(a) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context\nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period\nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the\napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\n\n5\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a respected employee of a defense contractor who accumulated\ndelinquent debts associated with (a) his making trust distributions to his family\nmembers from a trust created by his grandmother without making provision for\ncorresponding tax payments to the IRS and (b) his experiencing recurrent periods\nunemployment without any retained monetary resources to cover his debts during\nperiods of financial stress.  \n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s pleading admissions of the debts covered in the SOR (sometimes\nreferred to as judicial admissions) negate the need for any independent proof (see\nMcCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (3d ed. 1984)). Each of his listed debts are fully\ndocumented in his latest credit reports and provide ample independent proof of his\ndebts. Applicant and his immediate supervisor each confirmed the IRS\u2019s latest\nenforcement demands and garnishment intentions. Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay these debts warrant the application of\ntwo of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nWithout any documented payment history or tangible plan to resolve his major\ntax debt, Applicant cannot be credited with any more than minimal  progress to date in\nregaining control of his finances and provides no hard assurances of any commitment\nto resolve his IRS debt (by far the largest of his four accumulated debts).  To date, he\nhas made just three small payments on his federal tax lien, and faces almost certain\ngarnishment in the very near future. \nApplicant has made some tangible progress on two of his smaller debts: his\nutility and ambulance debts.  He documented payments to creditors 1.a and 1.c in the\naggregate amount of $100, and can be expected to fulfill his commitments to\ndischarge these two small debts in the foreseeable future.  However, he has not made\nany headway in addressing his veterinarian bill to date. \nApplicant\u2019s progress to date in regaining control of his finances is encouraging,\nbut is still a considerable work in progress that is only recently being addressed.  He\nstill is working on addressing his major IRS debt and finalizing repayment efforts with\nhis three other creditors. At this time, he can provide no predicable estimates as to\nwhen he will be able to make any significant headway on his IRS debt and satisfy his\nsmaller debts. \nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish\nsome extenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations.  As a result,\nMC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s repayment efforts with creditors 1.a, and 1.c entitle him to some\nmitigation credit under both  MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d and MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d Both of these mitigating\nconditions have partial application to Applicant\u2019s situation, given his tight financial\ncircumstances.\n\n7\nFull mitigation credit is not available to Applicant, however, based on the facts\nof this case. Neither Applicant\u2019s oral nor written evidence reflect any significant\nvoluntary repayment efforts on his major tax debt and one of his smaller debts. His\npayment receipts do reflect some modest repayment efforts in recent months. These\nefforts, although very limited, are encouraging. They are not enough, though, at this\ntime to warrant full application of any of the mitigating conditions covered in the\nfinancial guideline.\nMoreover, even if Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies did arise due to circumstances\noutside of his control, he could have been reasonably expected to have exerted more\nresponsible efforts in addressing his debts once the conditions that contributed to the\ndelinquencies had passed or eased, and his finances had improved. See ISCR Case\n03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004). Not only are his listed debt delinquencies\nongoing, but he has failed to address them in any material way.  \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is\nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While\nthe principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in\nfinancial cases.  Failure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve\nhis debts when able to do so raises security-significant concerns about the sufficiency\nof the applicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts.  His positive endorsement\nfrom his management team merit considerable praise and commendation.  In balance,\nthough, he has not shown enough tangible effort in addressing his tax and veterinarian\naccounts to mitigate his still delinquent debts and credit him with restored control over\nhis finances. \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them,\nand the modest steps he has mounted to address his old debts, it is still too soon to\nmake safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his largest debts and\nrestore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security\nclearance. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\n\n8\nsubparagraphs 1.b and 1.d.  His demonstrated repayment efforts are sufficient to\nmitigate the allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras: 1.b and 1.d:\n          Against Applicant\nSub-paras. 1.a and 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

Applicant admitted three of the four allegations in response to the SOR, but admitted all of the debts at the hearing. Applicant is a 30-year-old high school graduate who has been a benefits examiner for a defense contractor for over two years. She is a single mother raising a 12-year-old son. She has also completed some courses at a technical school. (Tr. 14- 18, Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated June 6, 2008). Credit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, dated June 24, 2008, and Gov. Ex. 5, dated March 7, 2009) listed for Applicant a delinquent debt of $2,295 in collection for a department store (SOR 1.a); a delinquent credit card debt in collection for $10,920 (SOR 1.b); another delinquent credit card debt in collection for $4,396 (SOR 1.c); and a delinquent credit card in collection for $5,435 (SOR 1.d). The total debt for the four credit cards is $23,045. Applicant gave birth to her child in July 1997, when she was 18 years old shortly after graduating from high school. Applicant had been accepted at a technical school so she started classes at the technical school in September 1997.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on June \n6, 2008. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant an \nundated Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F. The SOR was mailed to Applicant on June 4, 2009, \nand it is assumed this is the date of the SOR. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nJanuary 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 10, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 26, 2009. She admitted three \nallegations under Guideline F, but did not respond to the fourth allegation. Since \nApplicant did not respond to the allegation, it is considered a denial of the allegation. \nShe requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on July 17, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on July 24, \n1 \n \nOctober 20, 2009\n\n2 \n \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 13, 2009, for a hearing on August \n31, 2009. Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on August 19, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. The government offered four exhibits, marked Government \nExhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant \nsubmitted nineteen exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through S, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. The record was \nheld open for Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant did not submit \nadditional documents. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on September \n8, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to sensitive information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on August 19, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with \nDepartment Counsel the hearing date of August 31, 2009, prior to the Notice of Hearing \nbeing mailed so actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing. \nHowever, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only 13 days prior to the hearing. If \nthere was an issue on notice, Applicant waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 6-8). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted three of the four allegations in \nresponse to the SOR, but admitted all of the debts at the hearing.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old high school graduate who has been a benefits \nexaminer for a defense contractor for over two years. She is a single mother raising a \n12-year-old son. She has also completed some courses at a technical school. (Tr. 14-\n18, Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated June 6, 2008).  \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, dated June 24, 2008, and Gov. Ex. 5, dated March 7, \n2009) listed for Applicant a delinquent debt of $2,295 in collection for a department \nstore (SOR 1.a); a delinquent credit card debt in collection for $10,920 (SOR 1.b); \nanother delinquent credit card debt in collection for $4,396 (SOR 1.c); and a delinquent \ncredit card in collection for $5,435 (SOR 1.d). The total debt for the four credit cards is \n$23,045.  \n \n \nApplicant gave birth to her child in July 1997, when she was 18 years old shortly \nafter graduating from high school. Applicant had been accepted at a technical school so \nshe started classes at the technical school in September 1997. She worked full-time at \nnight to earn about $1,100 monthly income for herself and her child. Since she was a \nsingle mother, she lived with her parents who assisted with the care of the child but \ncharged her rent of half of her pay. She also had to purchase food and supplies for \nherself and the child. Her mother kept the child for about a year before the child went to \na day care center. She then had to pay for the day care expenses. The child's father \nhad agreed to pay child support. However, the child's father never paid child support, \n\n3 \n \nand he is in arrears over $29,000 (Tr. 71-77; App. Ex. P, Account summary, dated \nAugust 28, 2009). \n \n \nApplicant had to change jobs in January 1998, but she was not working full-time \nso her pay was reduced. She was unable to work and attend school so she stopped her \nschooling at that time. She also purchased a car for transportation for her job. At that \ntime, she was also interviewed and featured in the local newspaper concerning how a \nyoung single mother had to manage. Applicant was not making enough revenue to \nsupport herself and the child, so she started using credit cards (Tr. 77-80). \n \n \nApplicant used her credit cards to provide for the support of her child and herself. \nShe thought the child's father would pay the required child support and she would be \nable to pay off the credit card debts. Applicant continued working, in fact working two \njobs. She was able to make some payments on the credit card debts until she was laid \noff from both jobs in April 2003. She was unemployed for over two years until October \n2005. During this time, she drew unemployment for six months and also assisted her \nparents in their business for minimal pay. She started working for her current employer, \na defense contractor, in October 2005 (Tr. 14-17, 80-85).   \n \n \nIn 2008, Applicant went to a local government agency for debt counseling (App. \nEx. A, Counseling documents, undated). They recommended that she apply for a local \ngovernment program to subsidize the purchase or building of a house. She received \ncounseling from the government agency to assist her in paying her debts. They advised \nher to pay off her smallest debts first and then move to the largest debts. Her goal was \nto improve her credit score to qualify for the housing program. Just prior to the hearing, \nApplicant was notified that she was approved for the program because she had followed \nan action plan to pay off some of her credit card debts (Tr. 17-20; App. Ex. B, Housing \ndocuments, undated). \n \n \nApplicant is currently paid $9.86 an hour. Her monthly net salary is approximately \n$1,243. Her monthly expenses are approximately $1,150. Applicant recently had an \noperation on her knee after she fell. While her health insurance paid most of her \nmedical expenses, she was required to pay $500 prior to the operation and her post-\noperation co-payments were $3,120. She pays $50 monthly towards this debt and has \nreduced the debt to $2,700. After these expenses, her monthly discretionary funds are \nabout $50 (Tr. 25-27, 45-47, 85-92; App Ex. C, D, E, F, and G, Medical bills, various \ndates; App. Ex. L, Bill schedule, undated). \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged she has not made required payments on the credit card \ndelinquent accounts. She has not made payments on the credit card listed in SOR \nallegation 1.a since 2003. She believes the debt owed is only $1,961.92, as listed on \nthe credit card company documents, and not the $2,295 listed in the SOR (Tr. 33-45; \nApp. Ex. H, I, J, and K, Credit card statements, dated December 13, 2003, and August \n29, 2008).  \n \n \nApplicant's last payment on the debt listed at SOR allegation 1.b was in \nNovember 2003. However, Applicant maintained contact with the creditor. The debt is \n\n4 \n \nlisted on the SOR for $11,394, but Applicant believes the true debt, based on the \naccount statements received from the creditor is $9,855. She has been offered \nsettlement agreements for lump sum payments over the years. The latest offer was for \na lump sum payment settlement of $6,836.81. She does not have the funds to pay the \nsettlement (Tr. 45-55; App. Ex. M, Credit card statement, dated February 12, 2009). \n \n \nApplicant believes based on an analysis of the credit card statements that the \namount owed on the delinquent credit card debt listed at SOR allegation 1.c is for \n$3,952, rather than the $4,396 listed in the SOR. She also believes the amount owed on \nthe credit card debt listed at SOR allegation 1.d is accurately reported on the SOR as \n$5,435. She has not made payments on these debts since 2003. In addition, Applicant \npaid in full debts for a telephone account, a credit card, and a cable bill ((Tr. 55-67, App. \nEx. N, Credit statements, dated April 6, 2008; App. Ex. O, Credit report, dated May 27, \n2009).  \n \n \nApplicant presented letters from friends and co-workers attesting to her \ntrustworthiness, honesty, and sense of responsibility (App. Ex. P, Letters, various \ndates). Her father wrote that Applicant showed a high level of integrity and moral value \nin managing her debts for herself and her son (App. Ex. Q, Letter, dated August 29, \n2009). Applicant presented course completion certificates and awards from her \nemployer. Her performance has been excellent and she is listed as one of the \ncompany's most productive employees (App. Ex. R, Certificates and performance \nreviews, various dates). She has also been approved to return to technical school to \nfinish her education (App. Ex. S, Letter, dated August 8, 2008). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . \" assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a public trust concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent credit card debts, as established by credit reports \n\n6 \n \nand Applicant\u2019s statements and testimony, are a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  \nApplicant has four credit card debts that have been delinquent for over six years \nindicating a history of not meeting financial obligations, as well as an inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy her debts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). The debts became delinquent in 2003, are still unpaid, and \nare thus current debt. Applicant incurred the debts because she used credit cards to \npurchase items for her and her son. She worked two jobs but still did not make sufficient \nfunds to meet her and her son's needs. Her son's father was to pay child support but he \nhas not done so. The credit card debts became delinquent when Applicant was laid off \nand could no longer maintain payments on the debts. The circumstances of how the \ndebts were accumulated and her loss of employment were beyond her control. She had \nemergency surgery for an injury, but is making payments on those medical debts. She \nhas not accumulated additional delinquent debt. In fact, she paid off a number of other \ndebts. She sought financial counseling and qualified for a local government program to \nenable her to buy a house. The circumstances of the delinquent debts being beyond her \ncontrol and her actions to manage and pay her current debts show she acted \nresponsibly and reasonably. Applicant's action in paying her current debts is a strong \nindication that delinquent debt is not likely to recur. The debts do not now cast doubt on \nher reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI have considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). Applicant received financial counseling when she \ndiscussed with a professional financial counseling service an approach to resolving her \nfinancial issues. She also received financial counseling from a local government \nhousing authority to assist her in qualifying for house purchase. Her financial problems \nare under control.   \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments or reduction of \ndebt through payment of debts. An applicant is not required to establish that she paid off \neach and every debt listed. The entirety of an Applicant\u2019s financial situation and her \nactions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which that Applicant\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nplan for the reduction of her outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. \nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement \nthat a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts \none at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. All that is required \nis that Applicant demonstrates she has established a plan to resolve her financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has paid her current obligations, and is making payments on her \nmedical debts that she recently incurred.  She has not been able to make payments on \nthe four credit card debts listed in the SOR. The debts were incurred to purchase items \nfor her and her son. The boy's father was to pay child support but did not. The amount \nof the credit card debts was approximately $23,000, and the amount owed in child \nsupport is over $29,000. It is reasonable to conclude that Applicant would not have used \nthe credit cards to purchase items if the child support payments had been made. \nApplicant's actions in working two jobs at a time to earn money to support her and her \nson, attending school to prepare herself for better employment, seeking housing support \nfrom a government agency, and paying her current debts is significant and credible \ninformation to show that she acted reasonably under the circumstances.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provided \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve he issue). Applicant does not dispute that she owes the four credit card \ndebts. She does dispute the amount owed for three of the debts. She presented \nsufficient information to show a reasonable basis to dispute the amount of the debts. \nThe difference in the amounts, however, is not sufficiently significant to affect resolving \nthe issues. \n \nApplicant acted responsibly towards her debts and finances under the \ncircumstances. Applicant presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns \nfor financial considerations by establishing that the reasons for her debts were beyond \nher control and that she took reasonable and responsible efforts to manage her \nfinances. Her finances do not indicate a public trust concern.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n8 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's efforts to \nmake a better life for her and her son, her work ethic in working two jobs at a time to \nsupport her and her son, and that she is highly regarded by her employer and is \nconsidered honest, trustworthy, and reliable by friends, associates, and co-workers. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt using credit cards to purchase items needed by her \nand her infant son. She was only 18 years old at the time and just finishing high school. \nThe child's father did not pay his required child support. The child support arrears are \nmore than the amount of the delinquent credit cards.  \n \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment of her current \ndebts. She has or is paying all of her present debts except for the four listed in the SOR. \nShe established that she acted reasonably and responsibly towards her finances \nindicating she will act reasonably and responsibly to protect sensitive information. The \nmanagement of present finances indicates she will be concerned, responsible, and not \ncareless concerning sensitive information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from her financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for sexual \nbehavior, criminal conduct and personal conduct. Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), signed on July 11, 2008, to request a security clearance required as part of his \nemployment with a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nSeptember 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn April 9, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \n(Item 1) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal \nConduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on April 16, 2009. He signed a notarized Answer on \nApril 29, 2009, and requested a decision without a hearing. In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted to all allegations in the SOR. On June 10, 2009, DOHA Department Counsel \nsubmitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) in support of the government\u2019s preliminary \ndecision to deny Applicant's request to be granted a security clearance. The FORM \ncontained ten documents, identified as Items 1 through 10. The FORM and attached \nItems were forwarded to Applicant on June 12, 2009, and he received the package on \nJune 23, 2009. Applicant was given 30 days from the date he received the FORM to \nrespond. He did not provide a response by July 23, 2009. The case was assigned to me \non September 3, 2009, for an administrative decision based on the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 24 years old, is a single high school graduate with no children. He has \nworked for the same defense contractor since 2004. As of the date he completed his \nsecurity clearance application, he held the position of security officer. \n \nApplicant had been friends with another boy for about eight years. On June 25, \n2005, he dressed in black pants, black shoes, and a black turtleneck sweater, and \nclimbed onto the roof of his friend\u2019s house near the bedroom window of his friend\u2019s 14-\nyear-old sister. She heard movement on the roof and called her mother, who was \ndownstairs. When she arrived, the mother saw hands on the gutter above her \ndaughter\u2019s bedroom window, as well as part of a pants leg, which was black. Both she \nand her daughter saw that the person on the roof was holding a mirror, which the \nmother said \u201cwas being moved as if to get a view of [victim\u2019s] room.\u201d The mother called \nthe police to report a burglary (Items 9, 10). \n \nWhen the police arrived, Applicant told them that he was on the roof to play a \ntrick on his friend by writing a \u201cscary\u201d message on his bedroom window. He was not \ncarrying writing instruments. Applicant said that he was going to write it in the dirt on the \nwindow. He also told police that his friend might be away from home visiting someone. \nApplicant said he was looking into the sister\u2019s room only to check if she was close \nenough to catch him on the roof. The police report noted, \u201cWhen asked if he was \nlooking in [victim\u2019s] room for purposes of his own sexual gratification, [Applicant] looked \nat the ground, paused for a short time and then stated, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d Applicant \nwas handcuffed, taken in to custody in a patrol unit, and at the police station, he was \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nfingerprinted, photographed, and charged with Unlawful Sexual Contact, a \nmisdemeanor (Items 7, 9, 10). \n \n \nApplicant pled guilty to the charge and received a deferred sentence. He was \nalso required to register as a sex offender, serve two years unsupervised probation, pay \na fine, and complete a sex offense treatment program. Applicant paid the fine and \ncompleted treatment. According to the investigator\u2019s report of investigation, the charge \nwas dismissed in November 2007. Applicant is required to register each year at the \npolice department. His most recent report date was July 5, 2009. He notes that his \nparents and girlfriend are aware of the arrest. The file is silent as to whether other family \nmembers, coworkers, or Applicant's supervisor know of the offense (Items 6, 7, 8). \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines \nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this \ncase, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration \nof the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guidelines D, J, and \nE. \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest3 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.4 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \n \n2 Directive. 6.3. \n \n3 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n4 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under Guideline D: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \n \nUnder Guideline D, the following disqualifying conditions are relevant: AG \u00b6 13(a) \n(sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted) and AG \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack \nof discretion or judgment). Applicant was arrested for and pled guilty to a sexual crime. \nAs a result, he is listed on his state\u2019s registry of sex offenders and is required to update \nhis registration annually. His conduct demonstrates not only a lack of discretion, but \nalso a willingness to commit an illegal act to satisfy his own desires. Both disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n \n \nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: (AG \u00b6 14(a) (the behavior occurred prior \nto or during adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar \nnature) and AG \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior occurred about 10 days before his 20th birthday. Although he should have \nbeen mature enough at that age to avoid engaging in such conduct, he may have been \nimmature for his age, and some partial mitigation is available. As to AG \u00b6 14(b), the \noffense occurred four years ago, and there is no evidence of similar conduct since that \ntime. However, the file contains no indication that Applicant has admitted the offense. It \nappears that he continues to contend that he was playing a prank on his friend, and not \ntrying to see into the sister\u2019s bedroom. His failure to accept responsibility for his actions \nindicates a lack of rehabilitation, which raises questions as to future offenses and casts \ndoubt on his current trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 14(b) cannot be applied. On the whole, the \nfavorable mitigation is insufficient to outweigh the disqualifying conditions. I find against \nApplicant on Guideline D. \n \n \n5 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern pertaining to criminal conduct is that \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) \n(allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply, based on Applicant\u2019s arrest \nand guilty plea to a misdemeanor sexual offense. \n \n \nThree mitigating conditions under Guideline J have potential application: AG \u00b6 \n32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) and AG \u00b6 \n32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense).  \n \n \nThe mitigating condition AG \u00b6 32(a) is similar to AG \u00b6 14(b) under the Sexual \nBehavior guideline, and the analysis is the same as discussed previously: although four \nyears have passed since the offense, the fact that Applicant continues to contend that \nhe was playing a prank on his friend, and was not involved in sexual misconduct, \nundermines his current trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 32(a) cannot be applied. Along with \nApplicant's lack of admission and remorse for the effect of his actions on his victim, the \nfile contains no evidence of other rehabilitation, such as community involvement, or \ncharacter references from his employer, co-workers or friends. AG \u00b632(d) is not \navailable to mitigate Applicant's conduct. Finally, AG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply. The file \ncontains strong evidence that Applicant committed the offense. Applicant pled guilty to \nit, despite his continuing contention that he did not engage in inappropriate viewing of a \nminor in her bedroom. His excuse that he intended to write on his friend\u2019s window is \nundermined by his lack of writing instruments, his apparent knowledge that his friend \nwas not home to see the writing, as well as his presence near the sister\u2019s bedroom, and \nnot the friend\u2019s bedroom. I find against Applicant on Guideline J. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n6 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a. under Guideline E cross-references the 2005 sexual offense cited under \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior. Guideline E\u2019s focus on conduct that indicates \nquestionable judgment or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations is relevant \nto Applicant's behavior. His decision to view a minor female without her knowledge or \npermission, and to take planned steps to accomplish that goal\u2014wearing dark clothes, \ncarrying a mirror, climbing to a location near her bedroom\u2014all show an intent to violate \nhis friend\u2019s trust, and to break the law, and constitute behavior that is disqualifying \nunder Guideline E. \n \n \nThe relevant mitigating condition, AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much \ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), cannot be applied. Applicant committed a \ncriminal offense, which cannot be considered minor misconduct. He also undermined an \neight-year relationship with his friend and his friend\u2019s family in order to satisfy his own \ndesires. His lack of remorse reflects poorly on his current trustworthiness. I find against \nApplicant on Guideline E. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guidelines. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n \nApplicant was almost 20 years old when he deliberately entered the premises of \nhis good friend and climbed to the roof in order to view his friend\u2019s minor sister in her \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbedroom. His act is not recent, and he may have been immature for his age. But \nApplicant's continued contention that he was simply playing a prank when all indications \nare otherwise, his willingness to break the law, and to violate the trust of his long-time \nfriend and that friend\u2019s family, all raise questions as to his trustworthiness and good \njudgment.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts raised by criminal sexual conduct. \nSuch doubts must be resolved in favor of the government. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On May 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 6, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 21, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 24, 2009. On August 3, 2009, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2009. The case was heard on that \ndate. The government offered six exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits \n(Gov) 1 \u2013 6. Applicant testified and submitted no documents. The transcript was \nreceived on September 10, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nSeptember 25, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.d, \nand 1.i. She admits the remaining SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old dispatcher for a Department of Defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance. She has been employed in her current position since June \n2008. From 1989 to 1991, she served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps. \nShe separated as an E-3 with an honorable discharge.

(Tr at 4-6, 22, 51; Gov \n1; Gov 2 at 12)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed that she has the following \ndelinquent accounts: a $156 medical account placed for collection in October 2005 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 17; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 5); a $137 medical account placed for \ncollection in August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 17; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 5); a $539 \nmedical account placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 17; Gov 5 \nat 1; Gov 6 at 4); a $67 insufficient funds check written to a discount department store \nplaced for collection in May 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 17; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 4); a \n$282 medical account placed for collection in June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 17; Gov \n5 at 1; Gov 6 at 7); an $849 medical account placed for collection in July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f: Gov 2 at 17; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 7); a $323 medical account placed for collection in \nAugust 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 17; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 7); a $54 debt owed to a \ngrocery store for an insufficient funds check placed for collection in May 2003 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h: Gov 2 at 18; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 6); and a $12,034 debt owed after a voluntary \nautomobile repossession. (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 6 at 6).  \n \nApplicant owes past-due child support for her two oldest sons. She did not make \nchild support payments from 1999 \u2013 2009. She claims she was unable to afford the \nchild support payments in addition to supporting her immediate family. She testified that \nshe knew her two sons were being well provided for by her ex-husband and his new \nwife. On June 23, 2008, she appeared at the courthouse in response to a contempt of \ncourt letter for unpaid child support. She was arrested and released several hours later \nafter paying $1,000, which was applied towards her unpaid child support. Her paycheck \nis garnished $175.38 each pay period for child support. She is paid twice a month. The \ngarnishment includes payments towards her past-due child support which totals \n$32,635.80. (Tr at 19-22, 40-43, 45; Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 7-8, 14-16; Gov 4)   \n \nApplicant has not made any payments towards the other alleged delinquent \ndebts. The medical bills were the result of a medical treatment Applicant received in \n\n \n3 \n \n \n2005 when she did not have medical insurance. She has not contacted any of the \ncreditors who own the medical accounts. (Tr at 51) She contacted the creditors who \nown the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h on several occasions. Neither creditor had \ninformation about a debt owed by her. (Tr at 33, 39) With regard to the $12,034 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, Applicant believes this is related to a vehicle she turned in for \nvoluntary repossession in 1999. She has not been contacted by any agency pertaining \nto this debt. She has not attempted to contact the creditor who now owns the debt. (Tr \nat 33) In the past, Applicant had two periods of unemployment lasting approximately \none \u2013 two months, when she was between jobs. From April 2006 to June 2008, she was \nunemployed after the birth of her son. (Tr at 19, 56-57)    \n  \nApplicant intends to resolve all of her delinquent accounts. She is unable to make \nany payments towards her delinquent accounts at this time.  Her net monthly income is \napproximately $929. Her husband is a musician. His net monthly income is between \n$300 and $400. He does not have a full-time job. They also receive $185 each month \nfor food stamps. Their net monthly income is approximately $1,414. Applicant\u2019s monthly \nexpenses include: rent $880, groceries $200, utilities $36, and car expenses $80. The \npast-due child support is automatically deducted from her paycheck. Her total monthly \nexpenses are $1,196. After expenses, she and her family have approximately $218 to \n$318 left over each month. (Tr at 43-44, 52; Gov 2 at 11) \n \nApplicant was arrested in January 2009 for grand theft auto, a felony. She  \ntestified that the automobile belonged to her best friend. Her best friend has mental \nhealth issues and has made several suicide attempts within the past year. In October \n2008, Applicant recommended that her friend go visit her sister who lives in another \nstate in order to get away from her problems for awhile. Her friend had two cars. She \ndrove one car to her sister\u2019s house but one car remained in her driveway. Her friend left \nthe car keys with a neighbor. During the last week in November, Applicant called her \nfriend and asked her if she could use the car that was sitting in her friend\u2019s driveway. \nShe and her husband only had one car and were having difficulty accommodating each \nother\u2019s work schedules. Applicant claims her friend told her that would be fine and to get \nthe keys from the neighbor. Applicant got the keys from the neighbor and used the car \nfor purposes of driving back and forth to work until January 15, 2009. Applicant claims \nshe gave her friend $200 to cover the costs of additional insurance coverage. (Tr at 23-\n25; Gov 2 at 4; Gov 3)  \n \nOn January 8, 2009, Applicant\u2019s friend filed a criminal complaint against \nApplicant. She claimed when Applicant called to ask her if she could use her car, she \ntold her \u201cno.\u201d She alleges Applicant obtained the car keys from her neighbor under false \npretenses. On January 15, 2009, a sheriff\u2019s deputy came to Applicant\u2019s house. He \nasked for the keys to her friend\u2019s car. Applicant gave him the keys but told him that she \nhad permission to drive the car from the owner. Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith grand theft auto. In April 2009, Applicant entered into a pretrial diversion program. \nApplicant did not want to plead guilty but did not want to put her friend through any \nadded stress so she opted for the pretrial diversion program. When she discovered that \nthe arrest may have an adverse effect on obtaining a security clearance, Applicant \n\n \n4 \n \n \nvoluntarily withdrew from the pretrial diversion program and requested a jury trial.  Jury \nselection was scheduled for August 31, 2009. She is adamant that she did not steal her \nfriend\u2019s car. When she got the keys from the neighbor, she told him that he could call \nher friend to confirm that she had permission.  She claims that as the main breadwinner \nfor her family, she would not do anything to jeopardize her livelihood. (Tr at 26-31; Gov \n3) At the close of the record, Applicant had not gone to trial.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager testified on her behalf. She has worked for the company for \nthe past 14 months. He works with her on a daily basis. He describes her performance \nas exceptional. He describes Applicant as reliable and dependable. Applicant\u2019s \nmanager serves as the alternate security officer for the company. Applicant contacted \nhim the day after she was arrested on the grand theft auto charges. He is impressed \nwith her honesty and the fact that she followed reporting procedures. Applicant is one of \nhis top selections for potential promotion to supervisor. She does not need a security \nclearance in her current position but requires a security clearance for upward mobility. \n(Tr at 58-65)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are still required in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 30 of \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply. In June 2008, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with contempt of court for failure to pay child \nsupport. As a result of the arrest, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished to pay child \nsupport. In January 2009, Applicant was arrested for Grand Theft Auto, a third degree \nfelony.   \n   \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) are potentially \nrelevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and CC \nMC \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) potentially apply. \nApplicant claims that her friend gave her permission to use her car. In order to prove her \ninnocence, she withdrew from a pretrial diversion program and requested a trial. At the \nclose of the record, the case had not gone to trial. It is premature to apply any of the \nabove mitigating conditions with regards to the January 2009 arrest for grand theft auto. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions, her friend filed a theft report because she claimed \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthat she did not give Applicant permission to use the car. Her friend\u2019s assertions in the \ncriminal complaint conflict with Applicant\u2019s story. Based on the facts in the record \nevidence, Applicant was arrested and the charges are still pending. For these reasons, \nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s arrest in January 2009 for grand theft auto (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nare not mitigated.  \n \nThe concerns raised by the contempt of court charges related to unpaid child \nsupport are mitigated. Applicant\u2019s child support obligation is now deducted from her \npaycheck. I also considered the fact that it is unlikely that she was able to meet her child \nsupport obligations prior to being hired in her current job in June 2008. She was \nunemployed for two years prior to her current job. Her previous jobs did not pay well.  \nHer failure to pay child support was because of an inability to pay as opposed to a willful \nrefusal to make child support payments. SOR \u00b6 1.b is found for Applicant.  \n \nIt is premature to conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised as a \nresult of her arrest in January 2009 for Grand Theft Auto. Applicant has not met her \nburden to mitigate the security concerns raised under criminal conduct.  \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC & 19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant owes approximately $32,000 \nin delinquent child support. She failed to pay child support over a ten-year period. She \nowes $12,034 as a result of voluntary automobile repossession. She has approximately \n$2,286 in delinquent medical bills and owes $121 for two insufficient funds checks. Her \nfailure to pay her delinquent debts is the result of her inability to pay as opposed to a \nwillful refusal to pay debts.   \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \n\n \n7 \n \n \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept, 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. While \nApplicant is now paying her monthly child support obligation by means of a \ngarnishment, she has not taken steps to resolve her remaining delinquent accounts. \nShe did not attempt to contact the creditor who holds the $12,034 debt related to the \nautomobile repossession. She has not contacted any of the creditors who own the \nmedical bills. She did attempt to contact the creditors of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.h but claims that neither company had records of an outstanding debt. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues remain unsettled. Her failure to take action towards the majority of her \ndelinquent accounts continues to raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant was unable to \npay her child support obligations for a number of years because she did not have \nenough income. The medical expenses were incurred when Applicant had no medical \ninsurance. Applicant did not work for two years after the birth of her youngest child, but \nthe unemployment appears to have been voluntary. While certain factors beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems, I cannot say that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances because she failed to take action to resolve a \nmajority of her delinquent accounts once she obtained full-time employment in June \n2008. Aside from the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h, she made no attempt to \ncontact her creditors to take action to resolve her accounts. She did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. Aside from the \nchild support obligation, all of her delinquent accounts remain unresolved. It is unlikely \nthat her financial situation will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply with regard to most of the debts. \nHowever, credit is given for Applicant\u2019s child support payments. She appeared to be \nsincere about making sure her financial obligations to her two older sons are eventually \npaid. She contacted the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h, but neither creditor \ncould locate her account. I find for Applicant with respect to these allegations because \nof her efforts to resolve these accounts. However, Applicant took no steps towards \n\n \n8 \n \n \nresolving her remaining delinquent accounts. I cannot conclude that she made a good-\nfaith effort regarding those debts. \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Low wages, periods of voluntary \nunemployment, a spouse who does not work full-time, and a lack of health insurance \ncontributed to her financial problems. I considered the favorable recommendation of her \nmanager and his opinion of her outstanding duty performance. While Applicant is now \npaying child support, the majority of her delinquent accounts remain unresolved. \nApplicant needs more time to resolve her financial issues as well the unresolved issue \npertaining to her January 2009 arrest for grand theft auto. While Applicant\u2019s explanation \nof events leading to her arrest appears to be plausible, an issue remains because of her \nfriend\u2019s conflicting account that she did not give Applicant permission to use her car. At \nthis time, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the Criminal \nConduct and Financial Considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 10, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 22, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s factual findings are\nbased on substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n\u201cQ: [At the time you completed the SCA] you were a party to a civil action, is that right?  A: I didn\u2019t understand\n1\nthat answer or that question that way.  Q: How did you understand it?  A: I did not understand that what . . . the bank had\nbrought was a civil action against me.  I understood that what the bank was attempting to do was recover their loan.  I\nthought that I had the opportunity to prove my innocence and the results of that would determine whether it was a civil\naction or a foreclosure.\u201d  Tr. at 53.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant retired from the U.S.\nmilitary as an 0-6 following a 30 year career.  He is a naval architect for a government contractor and\nis also president of a consulting firm.  He held a Top Secret clearance while in the military.\nIn 2005 Applicant refinanced the mortgage on his primary residence.  He also mortgaged an\nabutting parcel of land upon which he intended to build a house.  He intended to sell that house for\na profit.  In the latter half of 2006, Applicant failed to make payments on the mortgage for his\nprimary residence.  The bank filed a complaint against Applicant, seeking foreclosure of the\nproperty.  Applicant and the bank litigated various issues related to the foreclosure, an appeal of a\nsummary judgement motion eventually making its way to the state supreme court.  However,\nultimately a trial court ordered foreclosure, although Applicant was able to redeem the property by\nobtaining another mortgage.  In 2007, the bank sought foreclosure of the mortgage on the second\nproperty.  Issues relating to this matter were litigated in court.  \nWhen completing his security clearance application (SCA) Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to three\nquestions.  One inquired as to whether, in the previous seven years, he had ever been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts.  Another asked whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt.  A third asked if, in the previous seven years, he had been a party to a civil court action.  At the\nhearing, Applicant advised the Judge that he had answered \u201cno\u201d to the first two questions because\nhe believed he would be successful in contesting the foreclosure actions.  Regarding the third\nquestion, Applicant stated that he did not realize at the time he completed the SCA that the\nforeclosures were civil court actions.  \nIn concluding that Applicant had deliberately omitted the information about his debts and the\nlawsuits, the Judge considered Applicant\u2019s status as a retired officer with prior experience in\napplying for security clearances.  She also considered the extent to which Applicant\u2019s claims not to\nknow that the foreclosures were civil court actions lacked credibility.  \u201cAlthough Applicant is not\na lawyer, it is simply not credible for him to claim that the results of the lawsuit would determine\nwhether it was a civil action or a foreclosure for purposes of whether he was required to disclose the\nongoing legal proceedings[.]\u201d  Decision at 11.    \n1\nIn his appeal brief Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  He provides detailed\ninformation concerning his reasons for obtaining the mortgages in question and concerning the\ncircumstances of the litigation which ensued.  Additionally, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding\nthat his omissions on the SCA were deliberate.  The Board has considered the Judge\u2019s discussion\nof Applicant\u2019s intent and concludes that it is sustainable.  In addition to the factors referenced in the\nprevious paragraph, the Board also notes record evidence that Applicant, a graduate of a U.S.\nmilitary academy, of a distinguished civilian university, and of his service\u2019s War College, possessed\na level of education more than sufficient to enable him to understand the questions at issue.  In\n\naddition, the record includes three exhibits, two being decisions by the state supreme court and\nanother an order of foreclosure by a trial court.  These documents contain findings of fact,\nconclusions of law, and appropriate orders from the courts.  They identify the bank as plaintiff and\nApplicant as defendant.  Anyone a party to proceedings such as those described in the aforesaid\ndocuments would reasonably have understood himself to have been involved in a civil court action.\nEven if the Judge\u2019s extensive findings contain errors or omissions, they are not likely to have\naffected the outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.\n9, 2007). \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that as of January 12, 2009, Applicant owed $132,000 to a bank that had initiated foreclosure proceedings against him (SOR 1.a), $8,268 on a charged-off loan (SOR 1.b), and about $6,000 in real estate taxes (SOR 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have falsified his June 12, 2008, e-QIP by responding \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28.a (delinquent over 180 days on any debt in the last seven years), 28.b (currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts), and 29 (party to any public record civil court actions not otherwise listed on the form). Applicant denied owing the debt in SOR 1.a on the basis that it had been paid in full. When he answered the SOR, he indicated he was making payments on the debt in SOR 1.b, although he admitted at his hearing that he was not paying on the debt. He denied SOR 1.c on the basis that the debt was not more than 90 days delinquent. Applicant also denied any deliberate falsification of his security clearance application, and asserted that he had responded to the best of his knowledge and understanding of court proceedings as of June 12, 2008. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 60-year-old retired Navy Captain with 30 years of active and reserve distinguished service (Exs. 1, B, Tr. 112-14).

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant fell behind more than 60 days on his mortgage in 2006, and the lender\ncommenced foreclosure proceedings. He resolved an order to foreclose on his home by\npaying off the loan through a new mortgage in January 2009. He still owes $6,000 in\nattorney fees to the lender, about $6,439 in delinquent real estate taxes on an\ninvestment property, and $8,268 on a delinquent construction loan. He intends to pay\nthose debts and he has been otherwise responsible in handling his personal financial\nmatters. But personal conduct concerns persist because he did not disclose the ongoing\nlitigation over the mortgage or that he owed a delinquent construction loan when he filed\nhis security clearance application. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 12, 2008. On February 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an\nSeptember 22, 2009\n\n2\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn March 2, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and he requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009, to decide whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On May\n4, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for June 5, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Nine government exhibits (Ex. 1-9) and\nfive Applicant exhibits (A-E) were admitted, all but Exhibit C without any objections.\nDepartment Counsel objected, in part to Exhibit C, on the basis it contained legal\nrepresentations about foreclosure in Applicant\u2019s state of residence. The document was\nadmitted in full, but I held the record open for two weeks at the government\u2019s request for\npossible rebuttal of Exhibit C following Department Counsel\u2019s research into the state\u2019s\nforeclosure laws. Applicant and two witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Just\nbefore closing argument, the government moved to amend the SOR to add two new\nallegations under Guideline F. I granted the motion, in part, over Applicant\u2019s objections,\ninfra. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on June 16, 2009.\nOn June 18, 2009, in rebuttal of Applicant exhibit C, Department Counsel timely\nsubmitted a memorandum, seeking the admission of an order and judgment of\nforeclosure (Ex. 10) and pertinent state statutes. Applicant filed no response, and\ngovernment exhibits 10 and 11 were admitted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nPursuant to \u00b6 E.3.1.17 of the Directive, the government moved to amend the\nSOR to add as SOR 1.c and 1.d two new allegations under Guideline F to allege that\nApplicant is indebted to the state for about $6,000 in unpaid taxes, and to allege that\nApplicant owes about $12,000 in outstanding attorney fees. Applicant objected on the\nbasis that these debts were not past due. I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection as to the\nattorney fees because there was no evidence that the obligations were delinquent.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s unrebutted testimony, the court ordered in early June that he had\n30 days in which to pay the bank\u2019s attorney fees. In light of the unpaid tax debt subject\nto the May 2009 tax lien, I sustained the motion as to the delinquent real estate taxes on\nthe investment property. Accordingly, the SOR was amended as follows:\n1.c. You are indebted to the state of [state name omitted] for unpaid real\nestate taxes assessed on June 19, 2008, in the approximate amount of\n$6,000. As of June 5, 2009, this debt has not been paid.\n\nApplicant clarified that three lots were involved. His primary residence and an undeveloped lot\n1\nseparate from the lot on which he was building the investment property, served as collateral for two mortgage\nloans taken out under a single promissory note (Tr. 124).\n3\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations,\nthat as of January 12, 2009, Applicant owed $132,000 to a bank that had initiated\nforeclosure proceedings against him (SOR 1.a), $8,268 on a charged-off loan (SOR\n1.b), and about $6,000 in real estate taxes (SOR 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal\nconduct, Applicant was alleged to have falsified his June 12, 2008, e-QIP by responding\n\u201cNo\u201d to questions 28.a (delinquent over 180 days on any debt in the last seven years),\n28.b (currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts), and 29 (party to any public\nrecord civil court actions not otherwise listed on the form).\nApplicant denied owing the debt in SOR 1.a on the basis that it had been paid in\nfull. When he answered the SOR, he indicated he was making payments on the debt in\nSOR 1.b, although he admitted at his hearing that he was not paying on the debt. He\ndenied SOR 1.c on the basis that the debt was not more than 90 days delinquent.\nApplicant also denied any deliberate falsification of his security clearance application,\nand asserted that he had responded to the best of his knowledge and understanding of\ncourt proceedings as of June 12, 2008. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 60-year-old retired Navy Captain with 30 years of active and\nreserve distinguished service (Exs. 1, B, Tr. 112-14). He held a top secret clearance\nwhile he was in the military (Ex. 1, Tr. 152-53). Since January 2000, he has been\nemployed as a vice president and naval architect for a defense contractor (Ex. 1), where\nhe is required to maintain a security clearance for his position and his managerial\nresponsibilities on two surface warfare programs (Ex. A, Tr. 47). Applicant is also\npresident of his own marine design and consulting firm (Ex. B) that, until recently, had\nbeen inactive for a few years (Tr. 134).\nAs of January 2000, Applicant and his family were living at his current residence,\nwhich is where he was raised (Tr. 43). The property had been in his family since 1945.\nApplicant was required to travel out of state about one week per month in connection\nwith his duties as vice president for the defense contractor, including to his employer\u2019s\noffice (Ex. 10).\nIn late May 2005, Applicant refinanced the mortgage on his primary residence.\nHe signed a promissory note of $885,000 with a bank, encumbering his primary\nresidence with mortgage loan #1 of $885,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), which was about $485,000\nmore than his original mortgage (Tr. 126). He also mortgaged an abutting parcel of\nunimproved land through mortgage loan #2 (Exs. 2, 3, 4, 9, 10). Mortgage loan #1 was\nto be repaid at $4,353.67 per month (Ex. 10). He borrowed the funds, in part, to build a\nhouse on an adjoining undeveloped parcel (lot #3) that he owned (Tr. 77).  His plan was\n1\nto sell the new home for about $1.2 million (Tr. 44, 88-89). In addition to the equity he\n\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show he had a loan of $93,000 for home improvement that he took out in\n2\nOctober 2006 (Exs. 2, 3, 4). He paid off that loan (Tr. 146).\nAvailable credit reports (Exs. 2, 3, 4) all indicate an unsecured loan with a high credit of $6,493 was\n3\nopened in June 2006.\nApplicant testified that his monthly net income was about $9,000 and his construction expenses were\n4\n\u201cprobably $10,000 a month.\u201d (Tr. 110).\nPursuant to 14 M.R.S.\u00a7 6321, after breach of a condition in a mortgage of first priority, the mortgagee\n5\nor any person claiming under the mortgagee may proceed for the purpose of foreclosure by a civil action\nagainst all parties in interest in either the Superior Court or the District Court in the division in which the\nmortgaged premises or any part of the mortgaged premises is located, regardless of the amount of the\nmortgage claim (Ex. 11).\n4\ncashed out from mortgage loan #1 that he planned to use for the construction, he had a\nseparate construction loan with another financial institution under which he was required\nto demonstrate progress in the building of the home before the bank would provide him\nthe funds that he needed to reimburse the contractors that he had hired (Tr. 44, 88,\n126-27).  His mortgage and construction loan payments together took between 40 and\n2\n50 percent of his monthly income (Tr. 127). Applicant believed that he could maintain\nthe payments and build equity for his family, because he planned on passing down the\nfamily home (Tr. 127-28). The residential market was favorable at the time construction\nbegan (Tr. 128).\nApplicant made timely, monthly payments on mortgage loan #1 until the payment\ndue April 1, 2006 (Ex. 10). Due to problems with the timing of construction financing on\nthe home, he had to shuffle sums of money to keep the construction project going. At\ntimes he used his personal income (about $120,000 annually, Tr. 110) to pay his\nconstruction contractors (Tr. 44, 83). Applicant brought his payments on mortgage loan\n#1 current in June 2006.3\nApplicant did not make his payment on mortgage loan #1 due August 1, 2006.4\nThe mortgage contained an acceleration clause that allowed the bank to pursue\nforeclosure on breach of a condition of the mortgage. On September 1, 2006, the\nsuccessor bank mailed a written notice of intent to foreclose to Applicant at his\nresidential address. Applicant was notified that he could cure the default by paying all\namounts due without acceleration within 30 days. Applicant did not receive the notice of\ndefault and right to cure (Ex. 10).\nOn October 6, 2006, the bank filed a complaint for foreclosure of the first\nmortgage and his primary residence (Ex. 9).  Applicant did not make his mortgage\n5\npayments for September and October 2006, although he assumed they could be made\nup. He repeatedly left voice mail messages with the bank\u2019s collection officer over the\nAugust to October 2006 time frame explaining his financial situation (Ex. 10). In\nNovember, Applicant attempted to resume payment, but it was rejected by the lender\n\nApplicant testified that the lender withdrew the funds from his account but then returned them (Tr.\n6\n84-85).\nApplicant testified that he had to pay about $20,000 in legal fees to the bank in the first action (Tr.\n7\n149). Court records indicate that the bank claimed $23,443.89 in attorney fees. The court awarded half for the\nclaim of the bank secured by mortgage loan #1 (Ex. 10).\n5\nand the funds were returned to his account. Applicant was away on business at the time\n(Ex. 10, Tr. 84, 208).6\nApplicant was served with the complaint of foreclosure in mid-November 2006.\nPreviously unaware of the bank\u2019s intent to foreclose, he contested the bank\u2019s actions to\naccelerate the note and to foreclose the mortgage securing his primary residence. In\nDecember 2006, the bank moved for summary judgment (Ex. 8). The district court\ngranted the motion and issued an order of judgment and foreclosure in favor of the\nbank. Applicant appealed, contending there was a genuine issue of material fact in that\nhe had not been given notice (Ex. 8). The original lender bank was acquired through a\nmerger by another financial institution (Ex. 10), and the successor-in-interest continued\nto pursue the foreclosure.\nOn May 20, 2008, the state supreme court vacated the summary judgment\nentered as to the foreclosure of mortgage loan #1, and remanded the case to the district\ncourt for further proceedings (Ex. 8). Following a trial in October 2008 in the district\ncourt, the court found it likely that the intent to foreclose and notice of right to cure was\nlost before it reached Applicant\u2019s mailbox. However, the post office certificate of mailing\nwas sufficient under state law to fulfill the bank\u2019s statutory requirement of constructive\nnotice to Applicant, absent any defects in the certificate of mailing (e.g., wrong address,\nnotice returned). In late October 2008, the district court ordered a foreclosure of\nmortgage loan #1. Applicant was given 90 days to redeem the property by paying the\namount due on the mortgage plus interest ($960,015.15 as of October 10, 2008) and\nreasonable attorney fees assessed at $11,721.95 (Ex. 10).  In about January 2009,\n7\nApplicant took out a mortgage loan of approximately $900,000 with another bank,\nputting up his primary residence as collateral (Tr. 74-75, 129). Applicant\u2019s monthly\nmortgage payment is about $6,000 (Tr. 75, 143). For consideration paid by Applicant\nfrom the monies obtained from this new loan, the bank discharged mortgage deed #1\nand stipulated to dismissal of its foreclosure action as to his primary residence without\nprejudice to any related or pending claims of the bank (Ex. C). \nWhile Applicant was contesting the summary judgment ordering foreclosure of\nmortgage loan #1, in late July 2007 the bank filed to foreclose on the abutting property\nthat had been put up as collateral under the promissory note. The bank alleged that the\namount due was the full $885,000 of the promissory note rather than the $250,000\nsecured by the undeveloped lot. On January 29, 2008, the district court granted a\nmotion by the bank for summary judgment, and entered an order and judgment of\nforeclosure. Applicant appealed, contending that the bank was barred from bringing a\nsecond foreclosure action when mortgage loan #1 under the same promissory note had\nbeen litigated to a final judgment (Ex. 9). In mid-October 2008, the state supreme court\nconcluded that the bank was not precluded from pursuing foreclosure of the second\n\nThe county registry of deeds is reporting liens filed May 8, 2008, as well as May 9, 2009 (Ex. 5).\n8\nApplicant apparently satisfied the May 2008 lien in January 2009 (Tr. 216). \nApplicant testified that the original balance of the unsecured loan was about $12,000, and that he\n9\nmade the $200 monthly payments on it for a couple of years (Tr. 60, 63, 69), although he presented no\nevidence of those payments. \n6\nmortgage. However, since the notice of delinquency and right to cure described the\nproperty secured by the first and not the second mortgage, the court decided summary\njudgment was improper and remanded this case to the district court as well (Ex. 9).\nApplicant testified that the lot securing mortgage loan #2 remained collateral for the\nlegal fees he was required to pay to avoid foreclosure of his primary residence (Tr. 122).\nIn about early June 2009, he was ordered by the court to pay $6,000 in additional legal\nfees to the bank within 30 days (Tr. 131-32, 141, 149). He intends to sell some property\nof his personal business to obtain the funds to resolve the matter (Tr. 133).\nApplicant continues to believe that the lender with whom he executed the\npromissory note in May 2005 acted in an unprecedented manner in proceeding against\nhim in foreclosure when he was fewer than 90 days late in his payments. As of June\n2009, the home that he had built as an investment property was still on the market with\nan asking price of $1.5 million (Tr. 89, 103). The property is subject to a $6,439.70 state\ntax lien that was filed against him in May 2009 for nonpayment of 2008 local real estate\ntaxes (Ex. 6, Tr. 104). Applicant testified the original tax debt was $12,000 and he paid\nabout half (Tr. 105).  He has paid his lawyer about $50,000 for representing him in the\n8\nforeclosure actions (Tr. 150). He still owes his attorney about $6,000 (Tr. 131).\nOn June 12, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP to apply for a security\nclearance for his position as vice president and manager of two surface warfare\nprograms. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to the financial record and financial delinquencies\ninquiries, including questions 27.c, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed\nagainst your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?,\u201d 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years\nhave you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?,\u201d and 28.b, \u201cAre you currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?.\u201d He also responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 29, \u201cIn\nthe last 7 years, have you been a party to any public record civil court actions not listed\nelsewhere on this form?.\u201d (Ex. 1). Applicant had filled out security clearance applications\nin the past when he was in the military (Tr. 112). Applicant testified that he did not\nbelieve questions 28.a and 28.b were applicable because he believed he would be\nsuccessful in contesting the lawsuits (Tr. 51), and that he failed to understand that the\nbank had brought a civil action rather than simply an attempt to recover the loan (Tr.\n53).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 20, 2008, revealed that Applicant owed a\nloan debt of $8,268 in collection (SOR 1.b),  and that mortgage foreclosure proceedings\n9\nhad been initiated against him (SOR 1.a). His mortgage was reported by the bank to be\n180 days past due as of June 2008 (Ex. 4).\nSometime in July 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\n(Tr. 95). His finances, including the status of his mortgage, were not brought up during\n\nShe operates her own consulting business, and is performing contract work on a program Applicant\n10\nmanages for his employer (Ex. E, Tr. 194, 205).\n7\nthe interview and Applicant did not volunteer any information about his dispute with the\nbank over his mortgage (Tr. 97). Applicant had a subsequent interview with another\ninvestigator who raised the issue of the foreclosure proceedings. Applicant expressed\nhis belief that the bank was trying to unload his \u201cnonperforming\u201d loan (i.e., loan not\nprofitable for the bank). He indicated that he could afford to make the monthly payments\non his mortgage (Tr. 97-101).\nSometime in 2008, Applicant began receiving collection notices about the debt in\nSOR 1.b. He disputed the balance because he had made all the payments in his\ncoupon book and did not receive a second book (Tr. 115). He was told that he had paid\nonly half of the debt (Tr. 65) and owed unpaid principal (Tr. 116). Applicant made no\npayments on the debt balance as of June 2009 because he was still paying legal fees\nfor his representation in the foreclosure matter. He planned on paying the debt in mid-\nJuly 2009  \u201cto just resolve the matter.\u201d (Ex. A, Tr. 65, 67-68).\nApplicant\u2019s gross annual income is about $160,000, including his military\nretirement, which he began receiving in January 2009 (Tr. 114). His monthly take-home\nincome is about $12,000 (Tr. 107-08). Applicant expects about $30,000 a year in\nincome over the next two years from his personal business as a naval architect (Tr.\n135). In April 2009, he accepted a contract to design a ship and received $6,000 as a\ndeposit (Tr. 133). He used it to pay bills (Tr. 134). He has about $200,000 in a 401(k)\naccount (Tr. 140) and about $4,000 in checking account deposits and $4,000 in savings\n(Tr. 139). Applicant does not rely on consumer credit cards for purchases (Exs. 2, 3, 4).\nA retired Naval Reserve Commander, who has known Applicant as a\nprofessional colleague or personal friend or both since about 1999,  is aware that\n10\nApplicant had some financial issues over the past year with the bank loan taken out to\nbuild the investment property (Tr. 195-96). She is aware from Applicant of the\ngovernment\u2019s allegation that he had lied on his e-QIP because he had not disclosed the\nbank\u2019s actions to foreclose on his mortgage. She understood from him that the bank\nhad not foreclosed on his home (Tr. 203). He has given her no reason to doubt his\nintegrity or his ability to protect classified information (Ex. E, Tr. 196, 200). \nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\n\n8\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nDOHA alleged in SOR 1.a that Applicant was past due about $132,000 in his\nmortgage loan, leading to the initiation of foreclosure proceedings. The evidence shows\n\nPursuant to 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 6321, the acceptance, before the expiration of the right of redemption and\n11\nafter the commencement of foreclosure proceedings, of anything of value to be applied on or to the mortgage\nindebtedness by the mortgagee, constitutes a waiver of the foreclosure unless an agreement to the contrary\nin writing is singed by the person from whom the payment is accepted or unless the bank returns the payment\nto the mortgagor within 10 days of receipt.\n9\nthat Applicant fell behind in his payments on mortgage loan #1. He missed his\npayments due in April and May 2006, but he caught up in June. After he failed to make\nhis monthly mortgage payments due the first of August and September 2006, the lender\nmailed him a notice of its intent to foreclose if he did not cure the default within 30 days.\nApplicant did not receive the notice, and the bank elected to commence with foreclosure\nproceedings under state law by filing a civil action. Unaware of the commencement of\nthe foreclosure action, Applicant missed his payment due October 1. An attempt to\nresume payment was refused by the bank. Since the funds were returned, it did not\nconstitute a waiver of the foreclosure action under state law.  Certainly, no payments\n11\nwere made on the mortgage during the protracted litigation, although at that point the\nbank is not likely to have accepted any efforts to cure the default. But there is also no\nquestion that Applicant was behind more than 60 days, or over $8,000 in his payments\nin the fall of 2006. Applicant also did not make timely payments on the loan in SOR \u00b6\n1.b. Available credit records show a past due balance of $8,268 as of June 2008 and no\nsubsequent payments on the debt. Applicant claims he paid about half of an original\n$12,000 balance although there is no evidence confirming those payments. Moreover,\nApplicant did not pay the 2008 real estate taxes on the investment property by the due\ndate and a lien was filed in the amount of $6,439.70 in May 2009 (SOR 1.c).\nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG\n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably be\napplied in mitigation. The state tax debt and the court order in late May or early June\n2009 requiring Applicant to pay the mortgagor\u2019s attorneys fees stemming from his\nbreach of the promissory note and mortgages #1 and #2 are too recent. Furthermore,\nApplicant has not made any recent payments on the delinquent loan in SOR 1.b.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies in a very limited sense that\nmaterials costs for the construction of the investment property were subject to market\nforces that Applicant did not control. The financial pressures that Applicant faced in\n2006 were essentially of his own making, however. He risked his family\u2019s home by\ndoubling the amount of his home mortgage in the refinancing to obtain funds to\nconstruct the investment property and in taking out a loan with another institution that\nwas tied to benchmarks in the construction. Mortgage loan #1 had terms favorable to\nboth parties to the contract in that Applicant was given an attractive interest rate. In\nreturn, the bank did not have to wait until he was 90 days delinquent to commence\n\n10\nforeclosure proceedings. Applicant had been allowed to cure one default earlier that\nyear. He was a victim of an unfortunate circumstance, in that he apparently did not\nreceive notice of the bank\u2019s intent to foreclose before the bank filed its civil action. Yet, I\ncannot conclude that the bank\u2019s actions were as predatory as he believes. Applicant\nknew he had not paid his mortgage payments for August and September 2006 on time.\nOn October 30, 2008, the district court ordered a judgment of foreclosure as to\nmortgage loan #1. Applicant had 90 days from the entry of the order to pay the principal\ndue on the loan plus interest and assessed attorney fees awarded the bank. Applicant\nsatisfied the mortgage debt in SOR 1.a in January 2009 through a new mortgage loan\nwith a different lender. He also paid some of the attorney fees awarded the bank in\nconnection with the two foreclosure actions. But it is difficult to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(d),\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d when he has done nothing to address the debts in SOR 1.b and 1.c.\nApplicant still owes about $12,000 in attorney fees. While they are not\ndelinquent, Applicant has to pay the bank its $6,000 within 30 days, and that debt is\nlikely to take precedence over the $8,268 delinquent loan balance in SOR 1.b and the\n$6,439.70 delinquent real estate taxes for the investment property. But his outstanding\ndebt is significantly less than the attorney fees he has paid in the past few years,\nincluding $50,000 to his own counsel.  He reports monthly net income of $12,000 since\nJanuary 2009 when he began receiving his military retirement. His new mortgage takes\nhalf of his income, and the $6,000 advanced to him in April 2009 for shipbuilding work\nwent to pay some bills. His financial situation is likely to improve in the near future\nthrough an expected $30,000 in income from that project over the next two years. AG \u00b6\n20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d applies. The\nrecord as a whole shows he is likely to resolve his debts.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, \u00b6 15 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAs of Applicant\u2019s completion of his June 2008 e-QIP, he was a party to two civil\nproceedings filed by the bank to foreclose his mortgage loans secured by a single\npromissory note. He had also defaulted on the loan in SOR 1.b. He did not disclose\nthese financial delinquencies on his e-QIP. Applicant denies the intentional concealment\naddressed under AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\n\n11\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nConcerning the delinquent loan in SOR 1.b, Applicant maintains that he thought\nhe had paid off the loan because he had used up his coupon book and not received\nanother book (\u201cI didn\u2019t get a second book, so there was, there is some confusion as to\nhow that loan had been administered and that\u2019s been part of the issue.\u201d Tr. 115). He\ntestified that he learned in late 2008 that he had paid only half the debt (Tr. 65), and that\ninterest had accrued on the account. But he also acknowledged that the creditor was\nclaiming unpaid principal on the account (Tr. 116). According to his own testimony, he\npaid on the loan for a couple of years at about $200 per month (Tr. 63). The available\ncredit information shows a charge-off balance of $6,493. These figures fail to\nsubstantiate his claim of a good faith belief that the loan had been paid.\nAs for his failure to disclose the delinquency in his mortgage, Applicant testified\nthat he was behind more than 60 but fewer than 90 days. He missed his payment for\nAugust, September, and October, so he would have been delinquent around 90 days, if\nnot more, when he attempted to resume payment in November 2006. Certainly by June\n2008, there was no question that Applicant was more than 180 days delinquent on the\nmortgage loan. Applicant testified he did not regard questions 28.a and 28.b as\napplicable because he believed he would be successful in contesting the lawsuits (Tr.\n51). Had Applicant acted in good faith, however, he would at a minimum have disclosed\nthe ongoing litigation in response to question 29 concerning any public record civil court\nactions in the last seven years. Applicant\u2019s claim that he did not understand that the\nbank had brought a civil action rather than simply an attempt to recover the loan (Tr. 53)\nis untenable. He is a retired Navy captain and vice president of a defense contracting\nfirm, who can reasonably be expected to understand the importance of full disclosure.\nAs of June 2008, Applicant had successfully appealed a summary judgment order of\nforeclosure of his primary mortgage to his state\u2019s highest court. Although Applicant is\nnot a lawyer, It is simply not credible for him to claim that the results of the lawsuit would\ndetermine whether it was a civil action or a foreclosure (Tr. 53) for purposes of whether\nhe was required to disclose the ongoing legal proceedings in response to question 29\non the e-QIP. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies because of his failure to disclose the delinquent\nconstruction loan in response to the financial delinquency questions and the litigation\ninvolving the mortgage loans in response to question 29.\nApplicant testified that he felt he would have the opportunity to discuss the\nmatters in detail during the investigation (Tr. 55). He had an obligation to provide \u201ctrue,\ncomplete, and correct\u201d responses on his e-QIP, although a subsequent rectification\ncould mitigate earlier falsification or deliberate omission. The evidence shows Applicant\ndisclosed nothing about the litigation or the related financial issues during his first\ninterview with a government investigator in July 2008. Apparently he was not asked\nabout it and he did not volunteer the information. Applicant discussed the matter during\nan interview of a later date with a different investigator, but it was not until the\ninvestigator asked him about the adverse information on his credit record. Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to volunteer the information during his first interview undercuts his explanation for\n\n12\nthe e-QIP omissions and precludes application of AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts.\u201d\nSimilarly, a personal belief that the bank was not being fair to him and that he\nwould ultimately prevail on the merits does not excuse or justify his failure to inform the\nDepartment of Defense about the current and ongoing litigation over his mortgage loan.\nAny failure to be fully forthright is serious and casts doubts on an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time\nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is not pertinent in light of the recency of\nthe falsifications. Applicant has yet to acknowledge that he was not as candid as he\nshould have been about his personal financial issues. AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur,\u201d does not mitigate the personal conduct concerns.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nThe financial issues stem from Applicant\u2019s decision to build a house as an\ninvestment property that he intended to sell for the equity that he would not realize in his\nown home. He took on substantial debt that he managed until spring 2006 when he was\nforced to use his personal income to pay for materials and labor for the construction.\nAfter expensive and protracted litigation, the lender prevailed in a foreclosure action that\n\n13\nApplicant resolved legally with the proceeds from a new mortgage loan with a different\nlender. He remains under some financial pressures in that he has to pay the lender\n$6,000 in legal fees within 30 days, the investment property is subject to a lien for\nnonpayment of taxes, and another bank is pursuing collection against Applicant on a\ndelinquent construction loan. However, Applicant is not likely to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds to address these debts. He has already paid substantial legal costs\nassociated with the lawsuit without resorting to illegal means, intends to resolve his\noutstanding debt, and has been otherwise responsible in handling his personal financial\nmatters.\nYet considerable personal conduct concerns persist because of his concealment\nof the ongoing litigation over the mortgage and the delinquent construction loan when\nhe completed his June 2008 security clearance application. Applicant, who had held\nhigh-level security clearances in the past for his military duties, was certainly familiar\nwith the purpose of the security clearance application. He knew, or can reasonably be\nexpected to have known, that he had an obligation to reveal the problems with his\nmortgage loan and the delinquency on the construction loan, and that it did not depend\non whether he ultimately prevailed, whether he felt the lawsuit was not justified, or\nwhether he disputed the balance of the delinquent construction loan. Despite his record\nof distinguished commissioned service, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\n\n14\nADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE\n",

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old radiological control technician employed by a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2007. He enlisted in the Army National Guard in April 1988, and he has continued his service in the National Guard until the present (GX 2 at 17). He has held a security clearance since August 1988. Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge on January 9, 1996 (GX 9). This bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ac. Applicant was married in December 1995 and divorced in June 2007. He has a 12-year-old daughter born during that marriage.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 2, 2007. On July \n27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 7, 2009; answered it on September 9, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nwas ready to proceed on September 28, 2009, and the case was assigned to an \nJanuary 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadministrative judge on October 2, 2009. It was reassigned to me on October 16, 2009, \nto consolidate the docket. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 27, 2009, \nscheduling the hearing for November 18, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through O, which were \nadmitted without objection. I kept the record open until December 4, 2009, to enable \nApplicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX P, Q, and \nR, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding \nAX P, Q, and R are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on December 1, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, \n1.m, 1.v, 1.w, 1.x, 1.ab, and 1.ac. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old radiological control technician employed by a defense \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2007. He enlisted in \nthe Army National Guard in April 1988, and he has continued his service in the National \nGuard until the present (GX 2 at 17). He has held a security clearance since August \n1988.  \n \nApplicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge on January 9, 1996 (GX 9). \nThis bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ac.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in December 1995 and divorced in June 2007. He has a \n12-year-old daughter born during that marriage. He paid child support and spousal \nsupport totaling almost $1,000 per month until April 2009 (Tr. 135), when he was \ngranted custody of his daughter (AX H at 1). His ex-wife is now obligated to pay $300 \nper month in child support, but she has not paid it (Tr. 119).  \n \nApplicant has remarried, and his current spouse is expecting the birth of twins in \nearly 2010 (Tr. 43). His spouse had about $100,000 in debts, mostly for medical \nexpenses, when they were married about three years ago. The medical expenses arose \nabout a year before Applicant met his current spouse, as a result of her giving birth to \nthree babies who died at birth (Tr. 25). \n \nApplicant graduated from a state police academy and completed an associate\u2019s \ndegree program in 1997 and 1998. He received a certificate of appreciation for his \ncontributions to a state counter-drug procurement program in January 1999 (AX E). He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in October 2000 (AX C). In March 2004, he was appointed \nas a special advocate for abused and neglected children by the juvenile and domestic \nfamily relations court for his community (AX D). He received a master\u2019s degree in \nbusiness administration in 2007 and a master\u2019s degree in management in 2009 (AX A; \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAX B; Tr. 43). He has about $70,000 in student loans, on which payment is deferred (Tr. \n132).  \n \nIn 2002, after Applicant was released from a period of active duty with the \nNational Guard, he received unemployment benefits. After three months he found \nemployment, but he continued to collect unemployment benefits because he needed the \nmoney. In June 2002, he was charged with filing a false statement for unemployment \nbenefits. The charge was dismissed after he paid restitution of about $1,300 (GX 2 at \n13, 23-24; Tr. 101-02). \n \nApplicant worked at a naval shipyard as a radiation monitor from March 2001 to \nSeptember 2004. Between October 2004 and April 2007, he worked at 17 different \nnuclear power plants in seven different states (AX A; Tr. 24). His security clearance \napplication reflects unemployment from June to November 2005, March to October \n2006, December 2006 to February 2007, and April to August 2007. \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in September 2007, Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to mismanagement and spending more than he earned \n(GX 2 at 7). He admitted most of the delinquent debts reflected on his credit reports, \nincluding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, and 1.v (GX 2 at 8-\n11). He later denied these debts in his answer to the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that many of his delinquent debts arose between 2004 and \n2007, when he was moving frequently and not receiving his mail (Tr. 24). He also \nincurred about $10,000 in legal expenses to gain custody of his daughter (Tr. 25, 160).  \n \nApplicant denied the debt for cell phone service alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.v. He \ntestified he contacted the service provider and was informed that they had no \ninformation on the debt and could not explain why it was listed in his credit report (Tr. \n86). He presented no documentary proof of his contact with the service provider. He has \nnot submitted written disputes of this debt or any of the debts alleged in the SOR to the \ncredit reporting agencies (Tr. 83, 87). \n \nThe federal income tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.aa includes the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.p, for which a tax lien was imposed and later satisfied (AX F at 2; Tr. 73). \nApplicant testified he filed his tax returns every year, but for several years the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) recalculated his taxes to be a greater amount. For some years, \ninsufficient taxes were withheld from his pay, resulting in taxes due that were more than \nhe could afford to pay when he filed his returns (Tr. 76).  \n \nApplicant estimates he currently owes the IRS about $2,000 (Tr. 25). He has \nnegotiated a payment agreement providing for $100 payments each month beginning in \nNovember 2009.

He was required to obtain debt counseling when he filed his most \nrecent bankruptcy petition. \n \n \nIn a personal financial statement submitted in response to DOHA interrogatories \non May 4, 2009, Applicant reported net family income of $4,284, expenses of $2,735, \ndebt payments of $67, and a net monthly remainder of $1,482. His net family income \nincluded his spouse\u2019s net salary of about $1,200. His spouse was injured in an \nautomobile accident and was unable to work from December 2008 until May 2009 (GX \n2 at 5; AX G). She returned to work but was laid off in July 2009. At the time of the \nhearing, she was unable to work outside the home because of her pregnancy (Tr. 133).  \n \n \nIn his bankruptcy petition filed on May 15, 2009, Applicant reported average \nmonthly income of $5,309, and expenses of $5,509, leaving a monthly shortfall of $200 \n(GX 10 at 75). He reported net assets of $16,216 and liabilities of $202,950 (GX 10 at \n10). He testified that the actual amount of debts discharged was considerably lower \nthan shown on his schedule of creditors, because several debts listed were duplicates \nand his listing of debts included his delinquent federal taxes and about $70,000 in \nstudent loans that were not dischargeable (Tr. 106).  \n \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant reported that his actual net family \nincome and expenditures for November 2009 were $3,726. The expenditures include \nsavings of $70 and a $50 payment to a prepaid college fund for his daughter (AX H at 4; \nAX Q). \n \nApplicant owns a 14-year-old car and an 8-year-old van, and the loans for both \nhave been paid in full (Tr. 125). He does not own a home, but he and his wife have \npurchased a $3,000 vacation time share, on which the monthly payments are $67 (Tr. \n127). He has about $2,000 in savings and $1,989 in his retirement account (Tr. 130).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n6 \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 27 delinquent debts totaling about $34,420 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.aa). \nIt also alleges an arrest for filing a false statement for unemployment benefits (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.ab), and two Chapter 7 bankruptcies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.ac and 1.ad). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe federal tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p is included in the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.aa. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, \none of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in the applicant=s favor. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). \nAccordingly, I will resolve the SOR \u00b6 1.p for Applicant.  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(d) is raised by \u201cdeceptive or illegal \nfinancial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax \nevasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional \nfinancial breaches of trust.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s \nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash \nflow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d The evidence and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions raise all four disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to him \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established for Appellant\u2019s delinquent debts, because his delinquent \ndebts are numerous, not yet resolved, and did not occur under circumstances that make \nthem unlikely to recur. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is also relevant to Applicant\u2019s arrest for filing a false statement in \nconnection with his receipt of unemployment benefits in 2001. It happened more than \nseven years ago, and it was a single act of misconduct that has not recurred. He \npromptly made restitution. On the other hand, it did not occur under circumstances \nmaking it unlikely to recur. Applicant was a mature adult at the time of the misconduct. \nHe has continued to demonstrate financial irresponsibility. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ab.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant encountered several circumstances \nbeyond his control. He had periodic periods of unemployment, a marital break-up, and \nan expensive custody battle. His spouse\u2019s recent automobile accident and inability to \nwork reduced the family income. On the other hand, many of his debts arose before his \nmarital break-up and before his spouse\u2019s injury. He has not acted responsibly. He has \nbeen continuously employed since August 2007, but he chose not to resolve most of his \ndelinquent debts, in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy. Several of the debts were small: \n$18 (\u00b6 1.g), $60 (\u00b6 1.j), $81 (\u00b6 1.l), $44 (\u00b6 1.n), $91 (\u00b6 1.u), and $140 (\u00b6 1.w); and they \ncould have been paid while his spouse was working. He admitted to a security \ninvestigator that his financial problems arose because of his mismanagement and \noverspending. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is established because Applicant has received counseling and his \nfinancial problems are under control. Whether they are likely to remain under control is \na separate issue addressed below. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y, because it \nwas resolved by garnishment of Applicant\u2019s pay and not by any voluntary act on his \npart. It also is not established for the debts discharged in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a \nlawful, legitimate means of resolving delinquent debts, and it can ameliorate the security \nconcern about resorting to unlawful means to obtain funds. However, it does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort within the meaning of this guideline.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.r, 1.z, and 1.aa. \nApplicant has paid the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r and he is executing \nreasonable payment plans for the federal tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.aa and \nthe judgment alleged in \u00b6 1.z.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nadmitted the cell phone debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.v when he was interviewed by a \n\n \n9 \n \n \nsecurity investigator in September 2007, but he disputed it in his answer to the SOR \nand at the hearing. The basis for his dispute is that he has never had a contract with the \nprovider. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established, however, because he has not provided any \ndocumentary proof that he has presented his dispute to the creditor or the credit \nreporting agencies. \n \nConditional Clearance \n \n \nDuring his closing statement, Applicant suggested the possibility of being granted \na conditional clearance for a year to allow him to demonstrate his financial responsibility \n(Tr. 161). I cannot adopt his suggestion, because I do not have authority to grant a \nconditional or interim clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. \nBd. Mar. 1, 2000). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He was articulate and he seemed \nsincere at the hearing. He has held a security clearance for many years, apparently \nwithout incident. He has supported national defense, doing dangerous work, for many \nyears. On the other hand, he has demonstrated financial irresponsibility for almost 15 \nyears. Although his most recent bankruptcy discharge significantly reduces the financial \npressure on him, he has not fully satisfied his federal tax debt or the judgment that \narose from his auto accident. He recently assumed responsibility for his daughter and is \nabout to become the father of twins. He has about $70,000 in student loans that \neventually must be repaid. His current budget provides virtually no discretionary funds. \nHe has meager savings available for unexpected financial emergencies.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.s-1.y: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.z-1.aa:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.ab-1.ad:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $40,815 for seven delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g) that, as of April 24, 2009, remained unpaid. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but denied with explanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.g. In addition to the facts established through the pleadings, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 58 years old, and has worked for the same defense contractor since June 1998. Applicant has been married three times. He and his first wife divorced in March 1971 after only three months of marriage. His second marriage began in May 1973, produced three children (one is deceased and the other two are in their 30s), and ended in May 1982 through divorce. Applicant and his current wife have been married since March 2008. Applicant is a Vietnam veteran who served in the Navy from 1970 - 1974, and he has held an industrial security clearance without incident for at least 11 years. (Gx. 1; Tr. 53 - 54) Between 1999 and 2006, Applicant lived with a woman who, without his knowledge or permission, ran up the balances on his credit cards and forged his name on checks for cash. He would have lost his house and car had he not been making those payments automatically from his checking account. He was unaware of her conduct until sometime in 2003, when his pay was garnished to satisfy a delinquent debt. Thereafter, he was ",

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant two sets of interrogatories  to obtain clarification of and/or additional\n1\ninformation about potentially disqualifying information in his background. After reviewing\nthe results of the background investigation, as well as Applicant\u2019s responses to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nMarch 31, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised adjudicative guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised adjudicative guidelines take precedence over the guidelines listed\nin Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to allow him access to\n2\nclassified information. On May 13, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which, if established, raise security concerns addressed\nin the revised adjudicative guidelines  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nOn June 10, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 21, 2009, and I convened a hearing on\nNovember 19, 2009. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented\nfour exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 4,\nand the Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record remained open after the\nhearing to give Applicant time to provide additional relevant information; however,\nnothing further was submitted. The record closed on December 4, 2009, and DOHA\nreceived the transcript of hearing (Tr.) the same day.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately\n$40,815 for seven delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g) that, as of April 24, 2009,\nremained unpaid. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation the\nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but denied with explanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.g.\nIn addition to the facts established through the pleadings, I have made the following\nfindings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 58 years old, and has worked for the same defense contractor since\nJune 1998. Applicant has been married three times. He and his first wife divorced in\nMarch 1971 after only three months of marriage. His second marriage began in May\n1973, produced three children (one is deceased and the other two are in their 30s), and\nended in May 1982 through divorce. Applicant and his current wife have been married\nsince March 2008. Applicant is a Vietnam veteran who served in the Navy from 1970 -\n1974, and he has held an industrial security clearance without incident for at least 11\nyears. (Gx. 1; Tr. 53 - 54)\nBetween 1999 and 2006, Applicant lived with a woman who, without his\nknowledge or permission, ran up the balances on his credit cards and forged his name\non checks for cash. He would have lost his house and car had he not been making\nthose payments automatically from his checking account. He was unaware of her\nconduct until sometime in 2003, when his pay was garnished to satisfy a delinquent\ndebt. Thereafter, he was also arrested and charged with uttering checks with insufficient\nfunds. The charges were dismissed after he convinced the court that his girlfriend had\nforged the checks. Until then, because he worked long days at both his contractor job\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nand extra jobs on the side (Tr. 28, 55), Applicant relied on his girlfriend to take care of\ntheir finances. After he learned of her actions, he took possession of his credit cards\nand hid them. After a long period of inactivity, however, the cards were reissued and his\ngirlfriend was again able to intercept them and continue her spending at his expense.\nApplicant tried to evict his girlfriend in 2003, but she attempted suicide in response to\ngain emotional leverage. He was eventually able to get her to leave in 2006. (Answer to\nSOR; Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 36 - 37)\nApplicant testified that his ex-girlfriend is currently in jail for having shot someone\nover money. (Tr. 58) He also averred that she has a history of financial crimes. This\nclaim is supported by the information he submitted in response to DOHA interrogatories.\n(Gx. 2) \nApplicant has repaid all but two of the debts listed in the SOR, and he has been\nworking since 2006 to resolve the debts his girlfriend caused. (Gx. 2; Tr. 41 - 52) There\nwere several other debts he satisfied after his girlfriend left that were not examined\nduring his background investigation. (Tr. 56) Applicant disputes the actual amounts\nowed on the two unpaid debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). As to SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant\naverred that the debt is actually $12,000, which he is willing to pay, but that it is being\nreported as $32,000 because of fees and interest charged by collection agencies. He\nwas trying to work with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but has not heard anything from that\ncreditor for several years. At one point he sent them $700, but the creditor began taking\nmoney from his bank account without his permission. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 27 - 29)\nApplicant\u2019s current finances are sound, as reflected in a personal financial\nstatement he submitted in January 2009. (Gx. 2) A review of the statement at hearing\nshowed that little has changed and that he has about $1,200 remaining each month\nafter expenses. The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c arose when he was injured on the job in\n2007, and was a combination of a shortfall in his medical insurance coverage and his\nreduced income while he was on short-term disability. He is currently awaiting word on\na request to be placed on long-term disability due to recurring back and lung problems.\nHowever, his house is paid for and he has incurred no new debts that he cannot pay.\nHe has no excessive credit card debt and he has never missed a car payment. (Tr. 61 -\n66)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18, Guideline F (financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must prove\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of\npersuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n6\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information\nin favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a - 1.g; that is, that Applicant owed $40,815 for seven delinquent debts.\nAvailable information, including his response to interrogatories and his response to the\nSOR, showed that, despite having resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - c, 1.f and 1.g, he\nstill owed about $38,000 for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. Accordingly, the\nrecord supports those allegations and requires application of the disqualifying conditions\nlisted at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history\nof not meeting financial obligations). \nBy contrast, available information, which was supplied largely through Gx. 2,\nshows that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by his ex-girlfriend. Applicant\nalso established that he has been working since 2006 to pay or resolve all of the debts\nattributable to him by the government\u2019s information, whether he incurred them or not.\nThe record supports his claims that his ex-girlfriend had a history of relieving others of\ntheir money through deception. Finally, Applicant established that his finances are\nsound, that he is meeting his current obligations, and that he is not likely to resort to\nillegal means to resolve his remaining debts. Thus, available information supports\nconsideration of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment); AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances); and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). On balance, I\nconclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns about his finances.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a mature,\nresponsible 57-year-old defense contractor with a history of stability in the workplace as\na long-term employee. His current financial health is sound despite the adverse\ninformation in the record, and he has held a clearance without incident since 1998.\nWhile he acknowledges that his decision making in response to his girlfriend\u2019s conduct\nwas not initially sound, in the past three years he has accepted responsibility for the\ndebts attributable to him even though they arose largely through the malfeasance of\nanother. The circumstances that caused his financial problems are not likely to recur\nand, because Applicant has acted to resolve his debts, do not pose an unacceptable\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n8\n6\nrisk relative to his access to classified information. A fair, commonsense  evaluation of\n8\nthis record shows that Applicant has satisfactorily addressed the doubts raised by the\ngovernment\u2019s information about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s\ninterests as his own.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest for\nApplicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is granted.\n                            \n                                               \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Roberts, Esquire\nSeptember 24, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn March 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F  for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn April 7, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on May 12,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 10, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on August 11, 2009, in La Vegas, Nevada. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on her\nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through P, which were also admitted without\nobjection. Four additional witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on August 19, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nadditional witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 64 years old. She is divorced and has four children, 14\ngrandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Applicant is employed as a Tech\nPublisher by a defense contractor, and she has worked for this company and its\nprevious owner since October 1979. Applicant has held a DoD security clearance since\nOctober 1980, and she seeks to retain her clearance in connection with her employment\nin the defense sector.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 1 allegation (1.a.) regarding financial difficulties under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. \n1.a. In the SOR, the allegation read \u201cYou are indebted to Countrywide on an\naccount that has been foreclosed in the approximate amount of $194,000.00. As of\nDecember 15, 2008, this debt has not been paid.\u201d \nBased on evidence introduced at the hearing, the allegation was amended. The\nnew allegation states, \u201cYou are indebted to Countrywide on an account that is in pre-\nforeclosure in the approximate amount of $194,000.00. As of December 15, 2008, this\ndebt has not been paid.\u201d \nApplicant testified that she purchased the house, which is the sole cause of her\nfinancial difficulties, in December 1994. When she purchased the home, the\nneighborhood was very family friendly. It was her intention, at the time of purchase, to\nremain in the house for the rest of her life. Over the years, the area has become \u201cdrug\nand gang infested\u201d with a substantial amount of violence and crime (Tr at 63-65). On\nOctober 1, 2008, Applicant moved out of her home, because of her fear of remaining in\nthat area. Her son lives in the home until it can be sold, to protect it, because many\nempty houses in the area have been vandalized. \nIn 2006, at the suggestion of her real estate broker, Applicant refinanced the loan\non her home by taking an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM). He advised her that her\npayments would be lower, and in two years she could refinance again and the\npayments would be reduced even lower (Tr at 64). She subsequently learned that her\nhouse payments were going to double in late 2008, but despite her effort, she received\na letter from her creditor, dated June 5, 2008, informing her that she would not be able\nto refinance again at that point because of \u201cinsufficient property value\u201d (Exhibit G). She\n\n3\nthereafter consulted an attorney about possibly filing for bankruptcy, but was informed\nthat she did not have enough debt to file.  \nApplicant was referred, by the security officer of her employer, to a real estate\nagent in an attempt to sell her home. The agent, who she had known previously,\ntestified at the hearing. He stated that he had known her for a number of years, when\nshe worked for a contractor and he was a Colonel and Base Commander in the United\nStates Air Force. In 1992 he retired from the Air Force and became a real estate broker-\nsalesman. In December 2008, he was contacted by Applicant to try and sell her house.\nAt that time she owed approximately $190,000 on a house that was worth no more than\n$100,000. The agent recommended attempting a short sale, and at her authorization,\nhe contacted the bank in an attempt to accomplish a short sale. The bank\u2019s position is\nthat, if they receive an offer, they should present it to the bank, which will then decide if\nthe offer is sufficient to accept. \nThe agent initially offered to sell the house at $115,000, reduced it to $99,000,\nreduced it again to $80,000, and he currently has it listed for $50,000. Exhibits E and F\nare the documents showing the history of the attempted sale of Applicant\u2019s house.\nWhile he has finally received a few telephone calls showing some interest in the house\nfor the first time as a result of this latest reduction, he has yet to receive an offer on the\nproperty. The Witness testified that every time he has approached Applicant to reduce\nthe sale price, she has always been very cooperative and reasonable. He reiterated that\nApplicant has done everything that she could to try to resolve the problem with her\nhome (Tr at 48).\nAt this point Applicant has not paid the mortgage since October 2008 when she\nmoved out of the house, but as yet the creditor has not filed a foreclosure for this\nproperty. \nMitigation\nIn addition to the real estate agent, three additional witnesses testified on behalf\nof Applicant. These included the branch manager of Applicant\u2019s employer, who has\nknown Applicant for 21 years. In addition to her testimony, she also submitted a\ncharacter letter (Exhibit M) that she identified as still being true and correct at the time of\nthe hearing. The second witness was a civilian branch chief of the U.S. Air Force, who\nhas known Applicant for 17 or 18 years.  She submitted a character letter (Exhibit K)\nthat she identified as still being true and correct at the time of the hearing. The third\nwitness was a civil engineer and the Deacon of Applicant\u2019s church, who has known\nApplicant for 12 years. He submitted Exhibit O, which was also true and correct. The\ntestimony and the letters recommended Applicant in the most positive and laudatory\nfashion, describing her as \u201ca person of the highest integrity . . . In all aspects and\nespecially in regards to security, she is the most conscientious and trust-worthy person I\nknow.\u201d(Exhibit M).\n\n4\nApplicant also submitted additional character letters that described Applicant in\nextremely positive terms (Exhibits L, N, and P).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n     Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated one significant delinquent debt and has not\nyet been able to resolve it. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), \u201cit may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s one overdue debt resulted because Applicant has been unable to sell her\nhome at anything near a reasonable price because of the house\u2019s great reduction in the\nvalue. This occurred partly because of the general recession, and to a significant\ndegree because of the deterioration of her neighborhood, certainly reasons beyond her\ncontrol. Applicant\u2019s refinancing of her loan also contributed to this overdue debt, but her\nbank would not let her refinance again. Applicant has done everything she could to try\nto resolve this debt, including consulting an attorney to explore the possibility of\nbankruptcy, and then engaging the services of a real estate agent, in an attempt to sell\nher home. She also has been extremely flexible in reducing the asking price in an\nattempt to make a sale. Therefore, I find that this mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n Applicant has made a good-faith effort to  resolve her one overdue debt. I\nconclude that because of this effort and her otherwise excellent financial record, she\nhas mitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why Mitigating Condition 20 (b) applies under Guideline F, the very\npowerful, positive recommendations from the witnesses who testified on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf, the laudatory character letters submitted by Applicant, and her long and\nexcellent record of employment, I find that the evidence leaves me with no questions or\ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole\nperson concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\n       Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\n       In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMartin H.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nApril 27, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn June 25, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn July 26, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on August\n26, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 17, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on October 15, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified\non his own behalf and submitted four exhibits at the time of hearing, which was also\nadmitted without objection. (Exhibits A through D.) I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\nthe record open until October 29, 2009, to submit additional documents. He timely\n\n2\nsubmitted eight additional documents, which have been entered into evidence without\nobjection as Exhibits E through L. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nOctober 30, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 56 years old. He is married and has no children. Applicant served in\nthe United States Navy from 1974 to 1996, and he received an Honorable Discharge.\nHe is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists eight allegations (1.a. through 1.h.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F. The allegations will be discussed below in the same\norder as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in April 2009 at the United States\nBankruptcy Court. Exhibit A consists of the bankruptcy Schedule F, showing the\nunsecured creditors included in the bankruptcy and the amount owed to each one. The\ntotal amount owed in Schedule F is $154,676. Applicant testified that under this Chapter\n13 bankruptcy he is required to make payments to a Chapter 13 trustee. (Tr at 48-49)\nExhibit D includes receipts showing that by the time of the hearing, Applicant had made,\nas scheduled, six payments of $1,383, for the months of April 2009 to October 2009. All\nof his debts are scheduled to be to be resolved in the bankruptcy in three years. (Tr at\n53)\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $6,651. Applicant\ntestified that this debt is included in his bankruptcy Schedule F as creditor 14. (Tr at 55-\n56)  Exhibit E also confirms that this debt is listed as both creditors 14 and 2 under\nSchedule F. \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $11,149. Applicant\ntestified that this debt is included in his bankruptcy Schedule F as creditor 1. (Tr at 58-\n59)  Exhibits E also confirms that this debt is listed as creditors 1 under Schedule F. \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $10,208. Applicant\ntestified that this debt is included in his bankruptcy Schedule F as creditor 10. (Tr at 59-\n60)  Exhibit E also confirms that this debt is listed as creditor 10 under Schedule F. \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $15,039.  Applicant\ntestified that this debt is included in his bankruptcy Schedule F as creditor 15. (Tr at 62-\n64)  Exhibit E also confirms that this debt is listed as both creditors 15 and 2 under\nSchedule F. \n\n3\n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $14,948. Applicant\ntestified, and the evidence confirms, that this debt is the same as 1.e., above. (Tr at 62)\n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $17,271. Applicant\ntestified that this debt is included in his bankruptcy Schedule F as creditor 11. (Tr at 64-\n65)  Exhibit E also confirms that this debt is listed as creditor 11 under Schedule F. \n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $7,553. A p p l i c a n t\ntestified that this debt is included in his bankruptcy Schedule F as creditor 14.\n (Tr at 68-69)  Exhibit E also confirms that this debt is listed as creditor 7 under\nSchedule F. \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant was working full time and also had a part\ntime job to make certain that he could pay all of his recent debts and continue to pay the\nbankruptcy trustee. Neither he nor his wife has any credit cards at this time, and he\nreviews all of his current debts with his wife to make sure they are all being resolved in\na timely manner.\nApplicant testified that his debts became overdue for the following reasons: After\nhe retired from the Navy he was unemployed for one year. After he started working and\nearning a significant wage, his wife made a decision to stop working, and unbeknownst\nto Applicant, she withdrew money from her 401k account, which caused a penalty to be\nowed to the IRS. After a period of employment, he was terminated because of a\ndisagreement with his employer. For the years between 2002 and 2007, he went\nthrough periods of unemployment or underemployment. (Tr at 34-46) Specifically from\nOctober 2006 through May 2007, Applicant was unemployed. (Tr at 70-71)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted three very positive character letters (Exhibit G). The\nDepartment Manager for his current employer, who was a member of the United States\nAir Force for 24 years, wrote that Applicant \u201cis a mature and level headed individual. . . I\nhave never had to question his integrity, dedication to the job, or his loyalty to our\ncountry.\u201d  The Branch Manager wrote, \u201cI have full confidence in [Applicant\u2019s] discretion\nand integrity in dealing with classified information. [Applicant] held a Secret clearance\nfor 21 years while on active duty with the United States Navy.\u201d  Additionally, he added,\n\u201cI consider [Applicant] a very trustworthy, dependable, and stable man and would not\nhesitate to entrust him with personal information I desired to be held in confidence.\u201d\nApplicant also submitted Performance Evaluation Reports (PE) received during\nhis service in the Navy for the period from 1982 through 1995, which were all excellent\n(Exhibit K).  In his final PE, his Commanding Officer stated that Applicant\n\u201cdemonstrated, balanced, desired and truly exceptional qualities of leadership, military\nbehavior and personal integrity. Met every challenge head-on with impressive results.\nHas my STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION for advancement.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was unable to\nsatisfy many of his obligations for a significant period of time. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties:  Under AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted\nabove, Applicant testified that his financial problems were in large part the result of his\nunemployment or underemployment for several years after he left the Navy. Applicant\nhas acted responsibly to resolve all of these overdue debts, by employing the services\nof an attorney to file for bankruptcy. Additionally, since this is a Chapter 13 bankruptcy,\nApplicant\u2019s is required to make payment each month to satisfy this bankruptcy. At the\ntime of the hearing, Applicant had already made 6 months of payments in the amount of\n$1,383 each. Therefore, I find that this mitigating condition is a significant factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nI also find AG \u00b6  20 (d) is applicable since Applicant has made a good-faith effort\nto resolve all of his overdue debts through bankruptcy. Based on Applicant\u2019s overall\nconduct, I conclude that he has mitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n6\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to how Applicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve his overdue debts,\ntogether with Applicant\u2019s excellent military career, and the positive character letters and\nevaluations he has received, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no questions\nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the\nwhole-person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.h.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in February 2001, resulting in a discharge\nin July 2002. Since then he has incurred additional delinquencies, three of which he\nsettled very recently. Applicant failed to demonstrate ongoing solvency or otherwise\nmitigate security concerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and\nexhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 18, 2008.  On May\n1\n27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).

A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n4\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non August 14, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. On September 9, 2009, he submitted\nadditional evidence for consideration with a letter, which contained no objection to\nconsideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel.

In September 2003, he was hired as a manager\nfor a vending company, but left that job two months later due to disagreements with the\nowner over management decisions. He finally regained full-time employment with his\ncurrent company in August 2004, having lived on temporary work, unemployment\ncompensation, and charitable contributions from food banks and his church for much of\nthe preceding two years.6\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in July 1999, but soon fired his\nattorney and the court dismissed his case in September 1999. He hired another\nattorney and again filed for Chapter 13 protection in November 1999. This case was\ndismissed in June 2000, for reasons that are not revealed by the record evidence.\nApplicant said that the case was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding on\nadvice of his attorney. His credit report shows that his Chapter 7 petition was filed in\nFebruary 2001, and his debts were discharged in July 2002. In the process, his\nmortgage lender foreclosed on his home. Records indicate that this creditor, or an\naffiliate, purchased the home in May 2003 for more than the outstanding balance on the\nmortgage, resolving that debt. The SOR \u00b6 1.i. allegation, concerning the outstanding\nbalance on the mortgage loan, is supported only by a credit bureau report dated August\n1, 2008, that reflects an April 2003 listing by the creditor stating that foreclosure\nproceedings had started. His later credit reports do not reflect any post-foreclosure debt\nto that creditor.  \n7\nDepartment Counsel agreed with Applicant\u2019s contention in his SOR response that\nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.l. are duplicate listings of the same $87 cell\nphone bill that went to collections in 2007. Applicant claimed in his June 2009 SOR\nresponse that this bill had been paid. In his September 9, 2009, response to the FORM,\nhe also claimed it had been \u201cpaid in full as stated on the attached document.\u201d That\ndocument is an August 25, 2009, letter from a collection attorney stating that an account\nwith the same creditor is paid. The letter, however, does not reflect the amount of the\ndebt and cites an account number different from that reported on all the record credit\nreports for the alleged debt. The September 8, 2009, credit report Applicant submitted\nwith his FORM response continues to reflect the alleged debt as unpaid.  \n8\nApplicant has not made any payments toward, or other arrangements to resolve\nthe $1,291 delinquent debt that he admitted owing as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He denied\nowing the $1,404 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f., stating that he had contacted a\nrepresentative of the creditor who could not locate a record of the account. However,\nApplicant admitted during his September 2008 interview with an Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigator that he opened this account in 2003 and let it become\ndelinquent after using the credit to pay other bills while unemployed. The account was\n\nItem 2 at 1, 2; Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 30; Item 8 at 2; FORM Response at 1, 3.\n9\nFORM Response at 1, 18, 21-23.\n10\nItem 2 at 2; Item 6 at 8, 10, 13; Item 8 at 2; FORM response at 1, 9-12.\n11\n4\ncharged off by the creditor, and is still reported on each of the credit reports in the\nrecord.9\nApplicant submitted documentation with his response to the FORM that he fully\nresolved the $43 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g., the $452 medical debt alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.j., and the $1,070 bank debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. The documents confirming\nacceptance of final payments on the medical accounts were dated September 9, 2009,\nand the bank debt receipt was dated August 31, 2009.10\nApplicant said he is making monthly $50 payments toward the $2,690 student\nloan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. His credit reports show payments toward one such loan\nthat is now current, but also reflect another account that remains delinquent. Applicant\nsubmitted insufficient evidence to permit a determination that these accounts are the\nsame, or that he is not still delinquent on the alleged debt.   \n11\nApplicant submitted insufficient evidence about his current income, living\nexpenses, or ability to resolve his remaining delinquent debts and avoid incurring\nadditional ones. He provided no evidence concerning the quality of his recent\nprofessional performance, the level of responsibility his duties entail, or his track record\nwith respect to handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures.\nHe submitted no character references or other evidence tending to establish good\njudgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his credibility,\ndemeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided without a\nhearing.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns\nunder four Guideline F DCs, as set forth in AG \u00b6 19:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n\nFORM at 4.\n12\n6\n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt;\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and\n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.12\nApplicant has been unwilling and unable to satisfy several of his delinquent debts\nand only recently resolved a few in response to the proposed denial of his desired\nsecurity clearance. Applicant did not meet his burden to demonstrate resolution of the\ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., e., f., and h., totaling $5,472. He was also unable to\nsatisfy his debts from 1999 to 2002, resulting in several bankruptcy filings. DC 19(a) is\nclearly established.\nThe evidence is insufficient to establish DC 19(b), in that Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquencies primarily arose during the periods when he was attempting to support his\nfamily while unable to find or remain in full-time employment. I cannot confidently infer\nfrivolous or irresponsible spending from the mere existence of this relatively modest\namount of delinquent debt under such circumstances, and the record is devoid of other\nevidence that would demonstrate such spending.\nApplicant has demonstrated a ten-year history of not meeting financial\nobligations, including a pattern of borrowing and spending beyond his means even after\nthe discharge of his former debt through his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002. Security\nconcerns under DC 19(c) are also supported on this record.\nApplicant regularly spent beyond his means from at least 1999 to August 2004,\nwhile he began working for his current employer. DC 19(e) thus applied during that\nperiod of time, when he lost his home to foreclosure and other delinquencies kept\nmounting. Only a few minor new delinquencies could be considered to have arisen\nsince that period based on credit reports in the record, and those are insufficient to\ndemonstrate any consistent spending beyond Applicant\u2019s means since late 2004.\nAccordingly, DC 19(e) supports no present security concerns independent of those\narising under DC 19(a) and (c), as discussed above. The evidence supporting these two\ndisqualifying conditions requires a closer examination and balancing of resulting security\nconcerns with any potentially mitigating matters, and shifts the burden to Applicant to\nrebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties in AG \u00b6 20. Under MC 20(a), disqualifying conditions\nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\n\n7\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial irresponsibility is recent, involves numerous creditors, and continues to date.\nHe remains substantially in debt, and he provided insufficient evidence concerning his\ncurrent financial situation that would support a finding that delinquent indebtedness is\nunlikely to recur. The evidence does not support application of this potentially mitigating\ncondition. \nUnder MC 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant suffered\nseveral years of under-employment after being fired or released for cause from several\njobs in 1999, 2002, and 2003. He offered no evidence that these job losses were unjust\nor not his fault. He also did not demonstrate that he responsibly reduced non-essential\nspending in reaction to his mounting debts. The evidence indicates that Applicant chose\nto continue borrowing money on credit that he knew he could not repay, even after\nhaving earlier debts discharged through bankruptcy in 2002. Although fully employed\nsince August 2004, Applicant did not address any of the SOR-listed delinquencies until\nmid-2009. He has not established mitigation of his presently delinquent debts, or of his\nfinancial history as a whole, under this provision.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under MC 20(c). Similarly, MC 20(d) applies where the evidence\nshows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d Applicant demonstrated the beginning stages of mitigation under these\ntwo provisions through his recent resolution of several delinquent debts. However, the\nabsence of evidence demonstrating his current solvency or ability to resolve the\nremaining delinquencies precludes present findings of \u201cclear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d or \u201ca good-faith effort.\u201d His pattern of\nincurring additional delinquent debt, after two unsuccessful Chapter 13 bankruptcies led\nto Chapter 7 discharge in 2002, casts further doubt in that regard. Insufficient evidence\nwas presented to alleviate the substantial security concerns raised by the length and\ndegree of financial irresponsibility that continues to date. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n8\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature\nindividual who is responsible for his voluntary choices and conduct that underlie the\nsecurity concerns expressed in the SOR. He established a consistent pattern of\nfinancial irresponsibility dating back at least ten years, with only partial and very recent\nefforts to resolve his outstanding obligations. \nApplicant failed to comply with the requirements of his two Chapter 13\nbankruptcy proceedings, and voluntarily incurred additional delinquencies after\nobtaining Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in 2002. He failed to demonstrate financial\nrehabilitation or evidence of solvency from that point forward, so recurrence cannot be\nsaid to be unlikely. He continues to bear financial obligations for significant past-due\ndebt and ongoing living expenses. He accordingly remains subject to pressure,\nexploitation, or duress. The record contains insufficient other evidence about his\ncharacter, trustworthiness, or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or tending to\nmake their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nDuplicate of 1.d.\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn March 31, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nApril 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 22, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on June 3, 2009, in La Vegas, Nevada. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through G at the time of hearing, which were also\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June 10,\n2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until June 17, 2009, to\n\n2\nsubmit additional documents. He timely submitted additional documents, which have\nbeen identified and entered into evidence collectively as Exhibit H, and the record\nclosed on June 17, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, with the exception of\n1.b., 1.d., 1.m., and 1.o., which he denied. The admitted allegations are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 54 years old. He is currently married and has four children. He has\nreceived a Bachelor\u2019s degrees. He served in the United States Air Force from 1973 to\n1997, when he received an Honorable Discharge. \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor, although he is not currently\nemployed by that company, but he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with\nhis employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 15 allegations (1.a. through 1.o.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, for overdue debts. The debts will be discussed in the\nsame order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $956.\nWhile in his RSOR, Applicant admitted this allegation, during his testimony he alleged\nthat he was disputing this debt for a dental bill, because he had informed the dentist\nonly to proceed with the procedure if it was covered under his dental insurance. The\ndentist had informed him he was insured, and after he received the treatment, he\nlearned that his insurance would not pay for this bill.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $137.\nApplicant testified that this debt, also for a bill from the same dentist as 1.a., has been\npaid. Exhibit 6, the most current credit report submitted by the Government, shows that\nthis debt has been paid.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,169.\nApplicant testified that this debt is being paid in the amount of $176.01 per month, which\nis deducted automatically, and which he has paid for almost one year. Exhibit F\nestablishes that payments are made monthly on this debt. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $139.\nApplicant testified that he believed this debt, for a phone for his wife, had been paid.\nHowever, no evidenced was introduced to establish if this debt has been resolved.\n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,030,\nwith a total balance of $16,097.  Applicant testified that this debt for a credit card is\nbeing paid in the amount of $291 a month for more than a year. Exhibit G shows that\nApplicant made payments for the months of April and May 2009, in that amount. Exhibit\nH shows that payments have been made at least from November 2008 through May\n2009, and the amount now owed is $14,983.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,679,\nwith a total balance of $48,543.  Applicant testified that he has been in contact with the\ncreditor for a second mortgage for a rental property that he owns, and he is still waiting\nfor a loan modification. At this point he remains overdue on the entire debt. Applicant\ntestified that in the last five years he has purchased 16 investment properties that he\nplanned to rent out. There are only two properties that still remain in his possession.\nThe other 14 have all been lost in foreclosure.  He still owns this property at this time. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $7,824,\nwith a total balance of $74,000.  Applicant testified that he has been in contact with the\ncreditor for this second mortgage for another rental property that he owns, and he is still\nwaiting for a loan modification. At this point he remains overdue on the entire debt, and\nthis is the other property that he still owns. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,565,\nwith a total balance of $179,000. This debt, for property that was lost in foreclosure, is\nstill owed. \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,045,\nwith a total balance of $127,000.This debt, for property that was lost in foreclosure, is\nstill owed. \n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$51,213. This debt, for property that was lost in foreclosure, is still owed. \n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$13,177, with a total balance of $121,000. This debt, for property that was lost in\nforeclosure, is still owed. \n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$205,294.This debt, for property that was lost in foreclosure, is still owed. \n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$512,213. Applicant was not certain as to the origin of this debt, but upon review it\nappears that this is the same debt as that listed as 1.j., above, and the correct amount\nowed is $51,213.  \n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 14 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$117,382. This debt, for property that was lost in foreclosure, is still owed. \n\n4\n1.o. This overdue debt to Creditor 15 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $207.\nApplicant testified that he has been disputing this debt for a trash collection bill, because\nhe did not own the property at the time that the services were performed. \nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties occurred primarily because his\nwife\u2019s mother and aunt both became ill with cancer and ultimately died. During the\nperiod when they were ill, both Applicant and his wife were a spending a great deal of\ntime taking care of them, leaving them less time to manage their properties. \nThere were several other reasons for Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. Applicant\nconceded that he was not the best manager, as he was \u201ctoo nice,\u201d not filing eviction\nproceedings against tenants when they failed to pay their rent. Applicant also estimated\nthat the property values are 50 percent below what they had been two years ago.\nFinally, Applicant purchased most of the properties in a poor section of the city, and if\nthey were vacant, they often became vandalized, and they could not be rented without\nconsiderable expenditures for repairs.\nAt this point, Applicant has consulted with several attorneys to determine if it\nwould be best for him to file for bankruptcy, and what would be the most appropriate\nchapter to file.  \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted several positive documents in Exhibit H including: a letter\nfrom his former employer, dated June 15, 2009,  explaining that Applicant\u2019s work was\nsatisfactory, and the only reason for his termination was because he did not currently\nhold a security clearance. He also submitted a number of extremely laudatory Senior\nEnlisted Performance Reports that he received during his service in the Air Force.\nFinally, he offered citations for service medals that he received.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\n\n6\nbeen unable to pay most of his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above,\nApplicant argued that his financial problems were primarily the result of the illnesses of\nhis wife\u2019s mother and aunt. However, there were other reasons that contributed to his\noverdue debts, including his poor ability as a property manager, and the poor choices of\nwhere to purchase the property. Therefore, I do not find that this potentially mitigating\ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case. \n Applicant has not resolved most of his very significant overdue debt. I conclude\nthat until he is able to significantly reduce this overdue debt, he has not mitigated the\nfinancial concerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition\napplies, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant  questions and doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.c. through 1.l,\n1.n., and 1.o.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.m.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. Applicant is a 57-year-old structural engineer technician employed by a Department of Defense contractor who is applying for a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer for approximately four months. He has held a security clearance since 2000. He also held a security clearance when he was on active duty in the United States Air Force. In January 1998, he retired from the United States Air Force after 21 years at the rank of Staff Sergeant. He is a high school graduate and has earned some college credits. He is married but has been separated from his wife since 1987. They have two adult children.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on June 12, 2008. On June 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 15, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 6, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on that same date. On August 7, 2009, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for August 26, 2009. The case was heard \non that date. The Government offered six exhibits, which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 6. The Applicant testified and offered three exhibits, which were \nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - C. The record was held open until September 8, \nSeptember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted a \ntwo-page document, which was admitted as AE D without objection. The transcript was \nreceived on September 10, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations.   \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old structural engineer technician employed by a \nDepartment of Defense contractor who is applying for a security clearance. He has \nworked for his current employer for approximately four months. He has held a security \nclearance since 2000.  He also held a security clearance when he was on active duty in \nthe United States Air Force. In January 1998, he retired from the United States Air \nForce after 21 years at the rank of Staff Sergeant. He is a high school graduate and has \nearned some college credits. He is married but has been separated from his wife since \n1987. They have two adult children. Applicant has two adult children from previous \nrelationships. He lives with his girlfriend and their 13-year-old son. (Tr at 4-6, 26, 28, 31, \n35-36; Gov 1.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has the \nfollowing delinquent accounts: a $2,384 judgment for a delinquent credit card account \nentered against Applicant in March 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 3); a $2,927 \ncredit card account placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 \nat 6); a $1,929 credit card account that was charged off in November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: \nGov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 4); a $3,367 credit card account placed for collection in June 2008 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 4); a $1,544 credit card account placed for collection \nin December 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 5 at 5); and a $1,573 military exchange account \nplaced for collection  (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 3 at 52). \n \nApplicant experienced difficulty with his finances after retiring from the military. \nHe briefly attempted to reconcile with his wife. It did not work and Applicant moved \nacross the country. He had difficulty paying bills, child support, and student loans. On \nFebruary 8, 2007, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt-repayment \ncompany. He made monthly payments to the company. In turn, the company negotiated \nsettlements on his behalf. All of the debts alleged in the SOR were included with the \nexception of the military exchange account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Tr at 33-34; Gov 1; \nGov 3 at 35-43) \n \nApplicant\u2019s military retirement check was garnished to pay the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. At some point, the allotment stopped, unbeknownst to Applicant. He \ncontacted the military exchange and agreed to take a $130 allotment out of his military \nretirement check each month. The allotment has started again and payments are being \nmade towards the debt. (Tr at 15-16; Gov 3 at 52-62; AE C at 2) \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe current status of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. $2,384 judgment for a delinquent credit card account: The account \nwas settled on September 30, 2008, by the debt-repayment company. (TR at 17-18; AE \nA at 3)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, $2,927 credit card account placed for collection: Debt is included in \nApplicant\u2019s debt repayment plan. Debt-repayment company is negotiating a settlement.   \n(Tr at 18; Gov 3 at 39; Answer to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, $1,929 credit account that was charged off in November 2006: The \naccount was settled on May 29, 2009, by the debt-repayment company. (Tr at 19, 23; \nAE A at 4; Answer to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, $3,367 credit card account placed for collection: During the hearing, \nApplicant indicated the debt-repayment company was negotiating a settlement. After the \nhearing, Applicant provided proof the account was settled for $859.53 on August 27, \n2009. (Tr at 16; AE B; AE D) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, $1,544 credit card account placed for collection: Debt is included in \nApplicant\u2019s debt-repayment plan. Debt-repayment company will negotiate a settlement.  \n(Tr at 23-24; Gov 3 at 39; Answer to SOR)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f, $1,573 debt owed to a military exchange placed for collection: The \ndebt was originally $3,142. The balance is currently $1,573. Applicant restarted an \nallotment out of his military retirement check on August 1, 2009. (Tr at 15-16; AE C at 2; \nGov 3 at 52-62; Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant resolved another credit card account ($1,132) that was not alleged in \nthe SOR through his debt-repayment program. (Gov 3 at 45) He no longer has child \nsupport obligations. His and his wife\u2019s expenses are not commingled because they have \nlived apart for over 20 years. He anticipates that his wife will file for divorce soon. (Tr at \n26-28) \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $2,350. His military retirement check is $900 a \nmonth. His net monthly income is $3,250. After the allotments are deducted from his \nmilitary retirement check, he receives $332.40. His rent is $1,050; groceries are $380; \ncar expenses $350; necessities $200; utilities are $150; and cable $100. After expenses \nare paid, he has approximately $1,000 left over each month. (Tr at 24-28) He has no \nopen credit accounts. He has one debit card. He is current on his federal and state tax \nobligations. (Tr at 30-33) He took a financial counseling course while on active duty but \nhas not recently attended a financial counseling course. (Tr at 34)  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties started \nafter his retirement from the military. Primarily, he had difficulty paying his credit cards. \nThe SOR alleged six credit card accounts, an approximate total of $13,724. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant \nstarted to resolve his financial problems in February 2007 when he entered into a debt-\nrepayment program. He resolved three of the debts as well as a debt that was not \nalleged in the SOR. The debt-repayment program will negotiate settlements for the two \naccounts that remain in the program. He established an allotment from his military \nretirement check towards the debt owed to the military exchange. The efforts taken \ntowards resolving his delinquent debts diminish doubts about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.    \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Applicant has been \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncontinuously employed. No circumstances beyond his control contributed to his financial \nsituation.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies. While Applicant has not received recent financial counseling, he started \nto resolve his delinquent debts by entering into an agreement with a debt-repayment \ncompany in February 2007. He has resolved four delinquent accounts. Two accounts \nare pending settlement in his debt-repayment program. He started an allotment and is \nmaking payments towards his debt owed to the military exchange. He has sufficient \nincome to pay his expenses. His financial situation has stabilized.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Over the past two-and-a-half years, \nApplicant has steadfastly worked towards resolving his delinquent accounts. Only two \ndebts remain in his debt-repayment plan. He is making monthly payments towards the \nmilitary exchange debt that was not included in his repayment. He initiated a good-faith \neffort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant struggled \nfinancially after retiring from the military. In February 2007, he established a plan to \nresolve his delinquent accounts.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 6, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 23, 2009, after the hearing,\n\n1The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under SOR subparagraphs 1(b-c) and 2(b-c) and (e) are not at issue in this\nappeal.  \nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nWe construe Applicant\u2019s brief as  raising the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1  Finding no error,\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 27 year-old systems\nadministrator for a government contractor.  He previously held defense-related employment,\nreceiving a security clearance in 2003.  Applicant began using marijuana at the age of 16 and\ncontinued to do so, on a monthly basis, until October 2008.  He used cocaine in 2006 or 2007.  On\nthe security clearance application (SCA) which Applicant filled out in March 2008, he was asked\nif he had engaged in illegal drug use during the previous seven years and whether he had ever\nengaged in illegal drug use while holding a security clearance.  The following August, Applicant\nwas interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) official who was conducting his\nbackground investigation.  Applicant told the investigator that he had never illegally used controlled\nsubstances during the previous seven years and that he had never illegally used controlled substances\nwhile holding a security clearance.  Applicant\u2019s answers on the SCA and to the OPM investigator\nwere not true.  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s omissions were\ndeliberate, based upon the totality of the record evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 07-03307 at 5 (App.\nBd. Sep. 26, 2008).  Given record evidence as to the extent of Applicant\u2019s drug use and the clarity\nof the questions at issue here, the Judge\u2019s conclusion is sustainable.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On March 6, 2009, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \n \n1I corrected and initialed the change to the case number listed on the statement of reasons (Tr. 4, \n16-17).

The revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and \nE (Personal Conduct) (GE 7). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (GE 8). \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on May 1, 2009, and the case was assigned \nto another administrative judge on May 4, 2009. On June 2, 2009, the case was \ntransferred to me because the other administrative judge had a family emergency \n(Transcript (Tr.) 17). At the hearing held on June 2, 2009, Department Counsel offered \nfive exhibits (GE 1-5) (Tr. 22-25). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 (Tr. \n25). Applicant did not provide any exhibits (Tr. 13). I also admitted the hearing notice \n(GE 6), the SOR (GE 7), and Applicant\u2019s SOR response (GE 8). I held the record open \nuntil June 9, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit additional evidence. I received the \ntranscript on June 10, 2009. Applicant provided one document after the hearing, which \nwas admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A.  \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n2.a, and 2.d (GE 8 on last page). He also made partial admissions concerning his drug \nuse in relation to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c (GE 8). He denied the allegations in SO \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.b and 2.c (GE 8). He did not address the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.e (GE 8). He claimed \nthat his failure to disclose some of his drug involvement on his security clearance \napplication was because he forgot (GE 8). His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old and has been employed by a government contractor as \na systems administrator since April 2008 (Tr. 6, 27, 29-30).3 He received a high school \ndiploma in 2000, and he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology in 2007 \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s SF-86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(Tr. 7, 27-29). He has begun working on his master\u2019s degree (Tr. 28). His first defense-\nrelated employment was in 2002 (Tr. 32). He received a Secret security clearance in \n2003 (Tr. 8, 30; GE 4). He applied for access to sensitive compartmented information \n(SCI) (Tr. 31). In the course of that application, he provided additional information about \nhis history of drug use (Tr. 31).  \n \nCharge for underage alcohol consumption and failure to disclose that information \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c)  \n \nWhen Applicant was 19, he was attending a party where alcohol was being \nconsumed (Tr. 34). A police officer came to the party and called some of the parents of \nthe attendees, who were under the age of 21 (Tr. 34). He denied that he was arrested \nand did not believe he was issued a citation (Tr. 34). He did not remember whether he \nwent to court (Tr. 35). However, municipal court records show that in 2001, the court \ncharged Applicant with possession of alcoholic beverages while under the age of 21 \n(GE 3). The court\u2019s civil docket shows a \u201cstet\u201d entry in 2002 for disposition of the \nincident (Tr. 36; GE 3).  \n \nSection 23d of Applicant\u2019s May 23, 2008, SF-86 asked, \u201cHave you ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant \nanswered, \u201cNo\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.b; GE 1). On January 29, 2009, Applicant responded to a \nDOHA interrogatory, and he denied that he had any previous alcohol-related arrests or \ncharges (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 40; SOR \u00b6 2.c). He said he forgot completely about the incident \nwhere the police interrupted the party and collected information concerning those \nattendees, who were under the age of 21 because of alcohol consumption at the party \n(Tr. 40).  \n \nInformation on Applicant\u2019s security clearance application concerning previous \ndrug use \n \nApplicant signed his SF-86 on May 23, 2008 (GE 1). He personally completed his \nMay 23, 2008, SF-86 (Tr. 68-69, 74-75). He denied that he used illegal drugs in his \nresponse to Sections 24a and 24b (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Section 24 provides: \n \nSection 24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity The following \nquestions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity. You are \nrequired to answer the questions fully and truthfully, and your failure to do \nso could be grounds for an adverse employment decision or action against \nyou, but neither your truthful responses nor information derived from your \nresponses will be used as evidence against you in any subsequent \ncriminal proceeding. \n \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAnswer the following questions: \n \na. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have \nyou illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, \ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, \ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription \ndrugs?    \n \nb. Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as \na law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while \npossessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and \nimmediately affecting public safety? \n \nInformation Applicant provided to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator concerning previous drug use (SOR \u00b6 2.d) \n \nOn August 7, 2008, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant (GE 2). Applicant \ndenied that he had illegally used any controlled substance in the last seven years (Tr. \n56-57, 63; SOR \u00b6 2.d; GE 2 at 14). He also denied that he had used controlled \nsubstances while holding a security clearance (Tr. 58, 63; SOR \u00b6 2.d; GE 2 at 14). As \npart of his DOHA interrogatories, Applicant verified that the OPM report of investigation \n(ROI) accurately described the content of his OPM interview (GE 2 at 12). In his SOR \nresponse, Applicant admitted that he did not disclose his illegal drug possession and \nuse while holding a security clearance to the OPM investigator (Tr. 59; GE 8). He \ndescribed his failure to disclose his illegal drug use to the OPM investigator as \u201can \nembarrassment in itself\u201d and as \u201cpretty bad\u201d (Tr. 59). He was very sorry about \nexperimenting with drugs while holding a clearance (Tr. 67). He has changed and is \nthrough doing things that are not legal (Tr. 67). \n \nOn December 19, 2008, Applicant completed an SF-86 when he applied for an \nSCI clearance as part of a job application with another agency (Tr. 72; AE A). He \nadmitted he used marijuana once in October 2008 on the other agency\u2019s SF-86 (Tr. 72; \nAE A at Question 23). However, he also indicated that he did not use a controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance (AE A at Question 23b).4 On January \n30, 2009, Applicant sent an email to DOHA stating he had \u201cPast drug usage (Personal)\u201d \nand he sent in his response to DOHA interrogatories, admitting drug use (Tr. 72-73; GE \n2 at 2). He interpreted his email to DOHA as a correction of the information about drug \nuse that he previously provided (Tr. 53; GE 2 at 2). On February 13, 2009, the other \nagency denied Applicant\u2019s access to SCI (GE 4).      \n \n                                            \n4 Any misstatements in Applicant\u2019s December 19, 2008, SF-86, concerning his illegal use of \ncocaine, marijuana and ecstasy will not be addressed in the Personal Conduct and Drug Involvement \nsections of this decision, and are only being considered with respect to his credibility and for the Whole \nPerson concept. \n\nIllegal Drug Use (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d) \n \n \nOn May 23, 2008, Applicant completed his SF-86 to upgrade his security \nclearance from Secret to Top Secret (Tr. 30-31, 45, 48). He has held a security \nclearance since October 2003 (Tr. 46-47). He held a security clearance in 2006 or 2007 \nwhen he used cocaine and in October 2008 when he used marijuana (Tr. 46-47, 49). He \nsaid when he failed to disclose his drug use on his security clearance application he \nwas \u201cincorrect\u201d (Tr. 52-53). He explained that when he provided his responses to \ninterrogatories and provided inconsistent information from his statement at his hearing \nabout the extent of his drug use, he \u201cmessed up\u201d (Tr. 50).  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant claimed his first and only use of marijuana was in 2008 \n(Tr. 38, 51). He claimed he used cocaine once in 2006 (Tr. 38, 51-52, 62, 66). He \nclaimed he used ecstasy once in 2002 or 2003 (Tr. 39, 51).  \n \nThe most credible description of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is contained in his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2). Applicant actually used marijuana starting at \nthe age of 16 and continuing on a monthly basis until October 2008 (GE 2). He used \ncocaine in 2006 or 2007, and he used ecstasy in 2002 (GE 2). \n \nResponses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories concerning previous drug use \n \nOn January 29, 2009, Applicant responded to a DOHA interrogatory about \nprevious drug use, under oath, as follows (GE 2 at 8): \n \n \n \n \nCorrected Decision \n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied that he used marijuana, cocaine or ecstasy more \nthan once each. However, he could not explain why he wrote \u201cmonthly\u201d next to \n\u201cMarijuana\u201d without a question mark, other than to say he \u201cmessed up.\u201d (Tr. 61-62, 66, \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n70-71). He said the question marks in the frequency column for ecstasy pertained to \nwhen he used illegal drugs within that month or year (Tr. 71). He thought DOHA wanted \nmore specifics about his drug use and he questioned what he was supposed to put \ndown on the form (Tr. 71). He conceded, \u201cBut monthly was incorrect and seems like a \nlie. For someone outside looking in, it seems like a great big lie. It does.\u201d (Tr. 72). \n \nAs indicated above, in response to DOHA\u2019s question, \u201cWhen did you first use \neach of the drug(s) listed above? He answered, \u201cmarijuana, 16 yr; extacy (sic), 19 yr; \ncocaine, 24 yr.\u201d (GE 2 at 8). Applicant responded to the interrogatories in his own \nhandwriting (Tr. 41). He insisted that he used marijuana on one occasion in October \n2008 (Tr. 41, 63-64, 66). Applicant explained when he wrote, \u201c16,\u201d he was thinking \nabout when he first used alcohol (Tr. 43). He only used cocaine once and that was in \n2006 (Tr. 66). When he completed the DOHA interrogatory, he swore the information he \nprovided in DOHA\u2019s interrogatory was accurate (Tr. 43-44; GE 2).    \n \n \nApplicant denied that he continued to associate with the persons involved in \nillegal drug use (Tr. 65; GE 2). \n     \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug involvement-related conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular \ncase. AG \u00b6 25(a), indicates, \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d5 AG \u00b6 25(c) states, \u201cillegal drug \npossession,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g) provides, \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a \nsecurity clearance,\u201d could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(g) apply. The other disqualifying conditions listed in \nAG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. These disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant \nused and possessed marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy.6 He eventually disclosed his drug \nabuse in his response to DOHA interrogatories, and to a lesser extent at his hearing. He \npossessed marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy before he used these substances. \nApplicant\u2019s Secret security clearance was approved in 2003, and he used marijuana \nand cocaine after his security clearance was granted.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n5AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n6AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana and ecstasy or 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine are Schedule (Sch.) I controlled \nsubstances. See Sch. I(c)(9) and I(c)(10), respectively. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) \n(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, 449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. \n2006) (ecstasy). Cocaine is a Sch. II Controlled Substance. See Sch.

There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d7 \n \n \n7 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. The Appeal Board addressed the recency \nof drug use, stating:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant used marijuana on a monthly basis beginning when he was 16 years \nold. He used marijuana until October 2008. He used cocaine in 2006 or 2007 and \necstasy in 2002. Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use was recent because it was nine months \nbefore his hearing. He recognizes the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse. These \nactions create some certitude that he will continue to abstain from drug use. AG \u00b6 26(a) \npartially applies to his marijuana-related offenses.8    \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has disassociated from his drug-using associates and \ncontacts. He has broken his patterns of drug abuse, and he has changed his life with \nrespect to illegal drug use. He has abstained from drug abuse for about nine months. \nHowever, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.\u201d9 AG \u00b6 26(b) does not fully apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury. Marijuna, \ncocaine and/or ecstasy were never prescribed for him. He did not satisfactorily complete \na prescribed drug treatment program. Moreover, he cannot receive full credit because \nhe did not provide \u201ca favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional, \nincluding rehabilitation and aftercare requirements.\u201d \n  \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his marijuana abuse in October 2008, about nine \nmonths ago. Aside from his marijuana use, all of his other illegal drug use ended in 2007 \nor earlier.10 Applicant used marijuana and cocaine while holding a security clearance. \n \n8In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n9Even if Applicant had provided such a statement, sufficient time has not elapsed since his most \nrecent illegal drug use, to warrant full mitigation of security concerns relating to his drug involvement. \n \n10The Appeal Board has reversed decisions granting a clearance because the administrative \njudge considered individual acts of misconduct one-by-one and determined the isolated acts were \nmitigated. ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006). Here, Applicant used \necstasy in 2002 and cocaine in 2006 or 2007, and marijuana until October 2008. His repeated abuse of \nthese particular drugs is relevant in the whole person analysis, but individually, as listed in the SOR, the \nabuse of two of the three illegal drugs more than two years ago is insufficiently aggravating to cause \ndenial of his clearance. In ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008), the Appeal Board \nexplained it is the overall conduct that determines whether a clearance should be granted stating: \n \nThe Judge's analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record failed to reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  By analyzing each category \nof incidents separately, the Judge failed to consider the significance of the \u201cevidence as a \nwhole\u201d and Applicant's pattern of conduct. See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860, \n866 (2d Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). Under the whole person concept, a \nJudge must consider the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding whether it is clearly \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nThe motivations to stop using illegal drugs are evident. He understands the adverse \nresults from drug abuse.11 He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no \ndrug abuse to partially, but not completely, mitigate drug involvement as a bar to his \naccess to classified information.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant used marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy in the previous seven years. He \nused marijuana and cocaine while holding a security clearance. He falsely denied this \ndrug use in his response to section 24a and 24b on his May 23, 2008, SF-86. He falsely \ndenied his drug use to an OPM investigator on August 7, 2008. His decisions to falsify \nhis 2008 security clearance application and to lie to the OPM investigator were \nintentional and deliberate. The falsifications were intended to deceive his employer and \nsecurity officials. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply.  \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0350 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 1999). The Judge\u2019s \npiecemeal analysis of Applicant's overall conduct did not satisfy the requirements of \u00b6 \nE2.2 of the Directive. \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006), see Whole Person Concept at pages \n13-14, infra.  \n \n11Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6 2.e that Applicant\u2019s drug use as detailed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.d also raises a personal conduct security concern. The government cross-alleged the \nsame conduct under both guidelines to ensure proper notice and full review as well as \nto address possible exigencies of proof. Clearly, his drug use raises disqualifying \nconditions under both Guideline E and H. See AG \u00b6 16(e). However, I will find \u201cFor \nApplicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.e because his illegal drug use is more appropriately \nand fully addressed under Guideline H. Duplicative coverage of his illegal drug \npossession and use in my findings under Guideline E is not warranted in this case.    \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) do not apply. Applicant did not make a prompt, good-faith \neffort to correct the falsification of his May 23, 2008, SF-86 before being confronted with \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthe facts. Instead, he chose to lie to the OMP investigator on August 7, 2008, about his \ndrug use. These two falsifications were not caused or significantly contributed to by \nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or \ninstructing him concerning the security clearance process.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. His falsification of his May 23, 2008, SF-86, and his \nlie to the OPM investigator about his drug abuse are not minor offenses. The two \nfalsifications are relatively recent. Because there are two offenses, the offenses are not \n\u201cisolated.\u201d The Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence requires consideration of all such offenses \nin a non-piecemeal fashion. The Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a \nwhole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of his conduct. ISCR Case \nNo. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 26, 2004)). The two falsifications continue to cause doubt about Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.        \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), 17(e) and 17(g) have some application, but do not apply to a \nsufficient degree to mitigate all security concerns under Guideline E. There are some \npositive signs of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation. He admitted his extensive drug use in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories on January 29, 2009. He said he ceased his \nassociations with other drug users. No other allegations of problems at his employment \nhave surfaced. He has promised not to use drugs in the future, which is an important \nstep toward his rehabilitation. He received job training and has a good employment \nrecord. His security manager is well aware of his drug abuse problems. Disclosure of \nhis drug use has reduced his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the charge of underage \nconsumption of alcohol because the allegations of falsification are not substantiated. \nThere is insufficient information that he knew he was charged, as opposed to being \ncited, for these offenses. I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the Findings section of this decision \nwith respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s false descriptions denying his illegal \ndrug use on his May 23, 2008, SF-86 and to his false statement in 2008 to an OPM \ninvestigator. These false statements were deliberate, and the allegation of falsification is \nsubstantiated.12 At the time he provided false information, he intended to deceive his \n \n12The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nemployer and security officials. These severe lapses in judgment are too recent and \nserious to be mitigated at this time.  \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant falsely denied at his hearing the full extent of his \nmarijuana use. He stated he only used marijuana once, when he actually used \nmarijuana on a monthly basis beginning when he was 16 years old, and continuing until \nOctober 2008. The decision not to be candid and forthright at his hearing shows he has \nnot been rehabilitated, and that personal conduct concerns are not mitigated.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nwas relatively young and immature when he used illegal drugs and falsified his May 23, \n2008, SF-86 and lied to an OPM investigator on August 7, 2008. Applicant\u2019s December \n19, 2008, SF-86, admitted that he used marijuana once in October 2008. This \nadmission of drug use is a positive sign that Applicant was coming to terms with his \ndrug use and beginning to take responsibility for his marijuana use in the context of his \nsecurity clearance. He stopped using illegal drugs in October 2008. He subsequently \nmade a more accurate admission of his illegal drug use in his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories on January 29, 2009. He knows the consequences of drug abuse. \nApplicant contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no \nevidence of any disciplinary problems at work. For example, there is no evidence he \nused illegal drugs at work. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would \nintentionally violate national security. His character and good work performance show \nsome responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His supervisors evidently support him \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nor he would not have been able to retain his employment after his security clearance \nwas called into question.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a problem with drug abuse beginning with his marijuana use at age 16. \nHe has not received drug counseling or treatment. However, if his only problem had \nbeen his drug abuse, security concerns under the drug involvement guideline would be \nmitigated by his continuing abstinence from drug abuse in about a year because of the \npassage of time. His falsification of his May 23, 2008, SF-86 and his lie to an OPM \ninvestigator denying his drug abuse cannot be mitigated at this time and for the \nforeseeable future. Applicant\u2019s December 19, 2008, SF-86, admits one use of marijuana \nin October 2008; however, he failed to disclose his illegal use of cocaine and ecstasy. \nHe failed to disclose the extent and frequency of his marijuana use.  \n \nAt his hearing, he chose to lie about the extent of his marijuana use. At his \nhearing, he chose to recant his description of his marijuana use that he provided in his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories. He falsely claimed at his hearing that he used \nmarijuana once in October 2008. Actually, I am convinced that he used marijuana on a \nmonthly basis beginning at the age of 16 and continuing until October 2008. His \ndecisions to provide false information were knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. \nHe was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. The false statements \nshow a lack of judgment in the context of security requirements. Such conduct raises a \nserious security concern, and a security clearance is not warranted. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns \npertaining to drug involvement and personal conduct.     \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d13 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n13See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \nCorrected Decision \n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b and 2.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Knier, Lay Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on July 11, 2008.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on March 19, 2009. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 24, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 8, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nSeptember 8, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd.

Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on May 14, 2009. DOHA assigned the case to another judge on\nMay 15, 2009 and reassigned the case to me for case load considerations on May 26,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 22, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on July 13, 2009. The government offered eight exhibits (GE) 1 through 8,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf. He submitted seven exhibits (AE) A through G, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on July 23, 2009. I held the record open until July 31, 2009, for the submission of\nadditional matters.  Applicant timely submitted four additional documents, AE H through\nAE L, which are received and admitted without objection. The record closed on July 31,\n2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice less than 15\ndays before the hearing on July 13, 2009. (Tr. 7.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6\nE3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. After consulting with his\nrepresentative, Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.

He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c\nand 1.e of the SOR.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 45 years old, works as an electronics test coordinator for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. His supervisor describes him as knowledgeable and\nhard working with a willingness to learn new information. Applicant began work for his\ncurrent employer in May 1987, one month after the United States Marine Corps\nhonorably discharged him. He served four years in the Marine Corps. He first held a\nsecurity clearance in the Marine Corps and has continuously held a clearance since\n1984. He always complied with the rules for handling classified documents.2\nApplicant married in 1984 and divorced in 1992. He has two sons, ages 24 and\n18.

His fiancee lives with him and has for a significant period of time. Applicant\ncoaches high school football and basketball.3\nAt the conclusion of his divorce, Applicant assumed responsibility for the debts of\nhis marriage, including credit cards which he paid monthly. He also paid alimony and\nchild support for his younger son for a period of time. In 2001, he decided to purchase a\nhouse. Based on his income and his fiancee\u2019s projected income, he qualified for a\nmortgage. Because he did not have money for a down payment, he financed the\npurchase through a primary mortgage and a secondary mortgage. He also acquired a\nloan and a line of credit for this purchase. At that time, he paid his bills, including his\ncredit card payments, and had a good credit history.4\nIn 2001, when football season began, his fiancee offered to manage the\nhousehold finances, as he was working two jobs. He agreed. By the end of 2002, he\nlearned that his bills were not being paid and the bank had started foreclosure\nprocedures on the house. When he discussed the problem with his fiancee, he learned\nthat she had mismanaged the household finances. She failed to pay bills; she bounced\nchecks; and she hid the problem from him. Applicant assumed control of his finances\nand checkbook in 2002. His fiancee is not allowed to access the checkbook.5\nWhen he realized the bank intended to foreclose on his house, he contacted the\nbank and worked out a repayment arrangement for his past due payments. Within one\nyear, he repaid his arrearage and this debt remains current. His also learned that his\nsecond mortgage, line of credit and personal loan were in arrears. He developed a\nrepayment plan on these debts. He repaid the arrears on these debts. His second\nmortgage is paid in full; his line of credit is almost paid; and his personal loan is current\nand will be paid in full within two years. He also paid several smaller debts in full, but did\nnot pay his long standing credit cards.  \n6\nIn late 2002, his fiancee developed pneumonia and pleurisy, which required\nexpensive prescription drugs to treat. She did not have health insurance. Applicant paid\nfor her medications, which impacted household finances at the time. To pay for her\nmedications, he did not pay his credit card payments.   \n7\nDoctors diagnosed Applicant\u2019s fiancee with lupus in late 2004 or early 2005.\nBecause she did not have medical insurance, he paid her medical bills for her\ntreatments. In late 2007, the Lupus Foundation started paying the medical bills for her\n\nTr. 21-22, 29, 32-34, 52.\n8\nAE C; AE D; AE H; AE J; Tr. 22-23.\n9\nTr. 37.\n10\nHe pays his property taxes for eight months in the year.\n11\nAE K; Tr. 31, 38-42.\n12\n4\nlupus treatments. Her disease prevented her from working. She applied for Social\nSecurity disability at least two years ago. Just prior to the hearing, her attorney notified\nher that Social Security approved her request for disability benefits. Applicant believed\nthat she would received a lump sum payment for back benefits. He did not know when\nthe lump payment would occur nor did he know when her benefits would begin.8\nApplicant initiated repayment with his creditors in 2008. He contacted his\ncreditors, one at a time, and arranged a resolution to his old, outstanding debts. As a\nresult of his efforts, he paid and resolved three debts, including the debts listed in\nallegations 1.c and 1.e, one at a time. He recently developed a repayment plan for the\ndebt identified in allegation 1.d. He made his first payment in July 2009. Under his\nrepayment plan, he will make six payments, which will fully resolve the debt by January\n2010.9\nApplicant has not developed a repayment plan for the two judgments and one\nadditional debt. He contacted his employee assistance program for guidance on\nresolving his debts. This program suggested he pay his delinquent debts before the\ndebts are reduced to judgment because the judgment impacts his credit rating.\nApplicant acknowledged responsibility for these debts, and indicated that he plans to\nrepay 7ach debt, one at a time.  \n10\nApplicant earns $19.58 an hour plus shift work differential pay. His employer\nreduced the work hours for the employees in the spring of 2009; he is now working full-\ntime. His gross bi-weekly pay for a full bi-weekly work schedule is approximately $1,760\nand his bi-weekly net pay is approximately $1,175. His net monthly income is $2,350.\nHe also earns $3,500 a year from coaching. His usual monthly expenses total\napproximately $1,700, including his mortgage, personal loan, utilities, cable, internet,\nfood, insurance, home telephone, and a car payment. He currently pays $275 a month\nfor his 2008 property taxes and $150 a month on one delinquent debt. He owns the car\nhe drives, but did not include gasoline as an expense, which is estimated at $100 a\nmonth.  After all his expenses are paid, he has approximately $125 a month for all\n11\nother unlisted expenses. Because of her illness and an old car with 180,000 miles, he\npurchased a used car for his fiancee to ensure reliable transportation to her medical\nappointments.

An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt in 2002 and 2003.\nHe could not resolve all the debts for a period of time. Some debts remain unresolved.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between 2002 and 2003. He accumulated delinquent debt when\nhis fiancee mismanaged the household funds from 2001 through 2002. He assumed\ncontrol of the finances and slowly worked to pay the unpaid bills. Except for this time, he\nhas regularly paid his bills. Given he now has control over his finances and his fiancee\ndoes not have access to the checking account, the circumstances leading to his debt\nproblems are not likely to recur, and they do not raise concerns about his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. This mitigating condition applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. His debt problems arose\nwhen his fiancee improperly managed the household finances for a year. When he\nlearned about the financial problems, he assumed responsibility for paying the bills and\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable in this case.\n14\n7\nmanaging the household finances. He contacted and worked with the bank to repay the\narrearage on his mortgages and personal loans. He successfully repaid the mortgage\narrearage by January 2004. His fiancee became ill in 2003 with pneumonia and\npleurisy. Because she did not have medical insurance and could not work, he paid the\nbills. He also paid her medical bills for her lupus treatment, which left him without\nsufficient funds to pay his credit card debt. When the Lupus Foundation agreed to pay\nfor her medical treatment, he began resolving his credit card debts. His recent loss of\nwork hours impacted his ability to proceed with his repayment plans. Now that he is\nagain working full-time, he is paying one old debt. He acted responsibly in identifying\nand resolving these debts. I find this mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol@ is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received financial\ncounseling. He did contact his employee assistance program which provided him with\nsome guidance on how to approach his debt resolution. He has paid many debts since\n2003 and continues to work on a resolution of all his debts. His finances are under\ncontrol. This mitigating condition has some applicability.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\ninitiated a repayment plan in 2003 for his mortgage arrearage and personal loans. He\nsuccessfully repaid his arrearage for these debts. When the Lupus Foundation accepted\nresponsibility for his fiancee\u2019s medical bills, he began to resolve his credit card debts,\none at a time. He paid three debts and has a payment plan in place for a fourth debt.\nHis current bills are paid. I conclude this mitigating condition applies.14\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems first began when he allowed his fiancee to manage the household\nfinances without any oversight by him. He has not resolved all of his debts alleged in the\nSOR and is paying his 2008 property taxes, not his 2009 property taxes. However,\nthese unpaid debts do not raise a security concern. When he learned in late 2002 that\nhis bills were not being paid and he was about to lose his house, he assumed\nimmediate control of the household finances. He developed a systematic repayment\nplan for his mortgages and personal loan delinquencies. He resolved these past due\ndebts and some smaller debts. His fiancee required extensive and expensive medical\ntreatment, which he paid. This expense interfered with his ability to pay his credit card\ndebt until much later. He began working to pay his credit card debt in 2008. As a result,\nhe resolved three credit card debts and has a payment plan for a fourth credit card debt.\nHe is systematically paying his debts. Given his long track record for resolving unpaid\ndebts, his intent to repay the remaining debts is credible. For the last six years,\nApplicant has worked towards resolving all his debts, one at a time. He does not live\nbeyond his financial means, and his debts are not the result of an extravagant lifestyle;\nrather, his debts occurred during a specific period of time. Since that time, he has taken\naffirmative action to pay or resolve much of the delinquent debts raising security\nconcerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) His 25 years of holding a security clearance without\nincident is a factor to consider. In reviewing all of the above factors in totality, his unpaid\ndebts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not\nsimply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise\nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. While some debts remain\nunpaid, they are insufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on July 23, 2009. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nH and E on June 3, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR and answered it in writing on June 30, 2009 and\nagain on July 20, 2009. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA\nDecember 23, 2009\n\nGE 1; Tr. 28, 45.\n1\nGE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 41-43, 49-51.\n2\n2\nreceived the request on July 23, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non August 31, 2009, and I received the case assignment on September 3, 2009. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 25, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on October 20, 2009. The government offered three exhibits (GE) 1 through\n3, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and four\nwitnesses testified on his behalf. He submitted three exhibits (AE) A through C, which\nwere received and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on\nOctober 20, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 28,\n2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b, and 2.a of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 28 years old, works as a graduate research assistant at a state\nuniversity. In this position, he also works as a project team leader for a Department of\nDefense contractor. Applicant began his work as a research assistant six years ago and\nbegan working on a government contract more than 18 months ago.  \n1\nApplicant was born in Taiwan and emigrated from Taiwan to the United States in\n1990 with his parents. He became a United States citizen in 1999 and holds a United\nStates passport. Applicant graduated from high school in 1999. He attended college and\ngraduated in 2003 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. He received a\nmaster\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering in 2005, and is currently working towards a\nPh.D in aerospace system design. He anticipates receiving his Ph.D in 2010.\nApplicant is engaged. He began dating his fiancee in 2005. They plan to marry in\nSeptember 2010. He does not have any children.\nAs a college student, at age 20, Applicant first used marijuana while on a college\nbreak. Applicant and his long-time childhood friend drove to his friend\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s\nhouse to watch TV. During the evening, his friend asked him if he wanted to try\nmarijuana. Applicant took four or five puffs from a bong, as he was curious about\nmarijuana. Over the next six years, Applicant used marijuana about four additional\ntimes. He smoked marijuana once or twice, ate a brownie with marijuana, and used a\nsmoking bowl maybe twice. He last used marijuana in the summer of 2007.2\nApplicant never purchased marijuana for his use or for use by others. He has\nnever been provided anything in exchange for marijuana and does not possess any\ndrug paraphernalia. He last used marijuana with his girlfriend in the summer of 2007.\n\nTr. 47, 52, 59, 64.\n3\nId. 44, 55-57, 61-62.\n4\nGE 1; GE 2; Tr. 55, 63.\n5\nAE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 13-36.\n6\n3\nTheir upstairs neighbor provided the marijuana to them. He sees his neighbor in the\ndriveway, but otherwise he does not have any contact with this neighbor. His girlfriend\nno longer smokes marijuana. To his knowledge, his girlfriend never purchased\nmarijuana.3\nApplicant\u2019s childhood friend still uses marijuana. Applicant served as his friend\u2019s\nbest man when his friend married in September 2009. To Applicant\u2019s knowledge,\nmarijuana was not at the wedding reception. He did observe marijuana at the bachelor\nparty for his friend. Applicant did not use any marijuana at the party, but he believed six\nor seven individuals of the twelve who attended did use marijuana. Following his\ndecision not to use marijuana, Applicant declined marijuana offers from his friend. His\nfriend no longer offers him marijuana. Because he lives several hundred miles from his\nchildhood friend, he sees him on rare occasions, usually when Applicant visits his\nparents. Before the wedding and bachelor party, Applicant has not seen his friend since\nlate December 2008 or early January 2009.4\nWhen he completed his e-QIP, Applicant acknowledged his past marijuana use,\nlisting his estimate of his use. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he had no future\nintent to use marijuana or any other illegal drug. He has never been arrested for drugs\nor treated for drug problems. Applicant\u2019s employer has a zero tolerance policy for drug\nuse at work, which he has not violated.5\nFour friends and co-workers testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They have known\neach other between one and five years. All work with him and associate with him\noutside of work. Each describe Applicant as hardworking, reliable, dependable, truthful,\nethical, and highly trustworthy. Applicant provided each with basic information about his\npast drug use and explained that his past drug use was the reason for the hearing.\nApplicant does not discuss using drugs as a social activity, and has never come to work\nsmelling of marijuana. His witnesses have not observed him smoking marijuana. Each\nstates that he follows company rules concerning the handling of proprietary information\nand sensitive information. His associates at work do not use drugs. A co-worker and his\nsupervisor wrote letters of recommendation, which also reiterate his reliability,\ndependability, and trustworthiness. Applicant is an exemplary worker and can be trusted\nto comply with company procedures for handling propriety information. Applicant\u2019s\nacademic advisor and the director of his laboratory opines that Applicant is candid and\nhonest. He obeys \u201call the facets of the rules and guidelines set by the school.\u201d Applicant\ncan be entrusted with proprietary information and to the best of his knowledge.\nApplicant has never been accused or suspected of improperly handling such\ninformation.   \n6\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of\n1970, \nas \namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. In this case, the following disqualifying conditions may apply:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and\n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nApplicant admitted in his e-QIP, answers to interrogatories, and testimony that he\nused marijuana on five or six occasions between 2001 and 2007. Although he has\nnever purchased marijuana or any other illegal drug, to use marijuana he had to\npossess it. The government has established its prima facie case under Guideline H.\nUnder AG \u00b6 26, Applicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns\nthrough the following conditions:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nand\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n\n6\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\nApplicant last used marijuana more than two years ago. Although his use of\nmarijuana was infrequent, his use was intentional and not under unusual circumstances.\nBecause he decided to use marijuana more than once, AG 26(a) is not applicable.\nApplicant stopped using marijuana two years ago and has expressed an intent\nnot to use marijuana or other illegal drugs in the future. Applicant has been honest and\nopen about his past marijuana use. The government became aware of his marijuana\nuse when he acknowledged it on his e-QIP. Because of his truthfulness, I find his\nstatement that he will not use drugs in the future credible. Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline H.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nUnder AG \u00b6 16, the following conditions could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s past drug use creates a vulnerability for exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress. He continues to sporadically associate with his childhood friend who continues\nto use marijuana, an illegal substance. The government has established the applicability\nof the above disqualifying conditions under Guideline E.\nUnder AG \u00b6 17, Applicant could mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns\nunder the following conditions:\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nApplicant has been forthright and truthful about his past, infrequent marijuana\nuse. He is not addicted to marijuana; thus, he has no need for counseling. He, however,\ndecided not to use marijuana two years ago and will not use it in the future. Because of\nhis truthfulness and openness about his past drug use, I find his statements about when\nhe stopped using marijuana and about his future intent credible.\nApplicant continues to associate with his childhood friend, an individual who still\nuses marijuana. Applicant does not spend much time with his friend, in part because\nthey live many miles from each other. Marijuana use is not the basis for their friendship\nand is not the reason they visit with each other. His childhood friend introduced\nApplicant to marijuana. The friend now respects Applicant\u2019s decision not to use\nmarijuana and does not press Applicant to participate. While his friend still uses\nmarijuana, Applicant\u2019s continued association with his childhood friend does not caste\ndoubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations. Applicant complies with his workplace rules on\nhandling proprietary information. His witnesses describe him as trustworthy, reliable,\ndependable, and ethical. In weighing all the evidence, I find that Applicant has mitigated\nthe government\u2019s security concerns about his personal conduct as related to his past\ndrug use.  \n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\n\n8\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nused marijuana infrequently as a college and graduate student. His childhood friend of\nmany years introduced him to marijuana because Applicant was curious about it. Other\nthan his infrequent use of marijuana, Applicant is a model young adult working towards\nthe American dream. He immigrated to the United States with his parents when he was\nnine years old. He became a citizen in 1999, about the time he graduated from high\nschool. He attended college, graduating in 2003 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical\nengineering.  He immediately enrolled in graduated school, where he continues to work\nand study. Two years after his college graduation, he received his master\u2019s degree and\nis currently working on his Ph.D. His co-workers, supervisor, and academic advisor\nspeak highly of him. All of them describe him as honest and trustworthy. He is\ndependable and reliable with a strong work ethic. He is planning to marry his long-term\ngirlfriend in 2010. He still associates with his childhood friend, who continues to use\nmarijuana. This association does not raise a security concern because the friendship is\nnot based on marijuana use, but bonds established over a long period of time. His friend\nunderstands and respects Applicant\u2019s wishes not to use marijuana. Their friendship is\nmany years old and will continue into the future, but with fewer contacts because they\nlive many miles apart and have different lives and responsibilities.\n\n9\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising about his past drug use and\npersonal conduct related to his past drug use under Guidelines H and E.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 12, 2009, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on June 2, 2009, and did not respond with any information. The case\nwas assigned to me on July 31, 2009.   Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nand exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nOctober 19, 2009\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 19 delinquent debts\nexceeding $26,000. They are comprised of delinquent consumer accounts, medical\ndebts, and deficiency debts associated with two vehicle repossessions.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He\nprovided no explanations for his admitted debts. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old production support technician for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married in February 2005 and has two children from his marriage, ages\nfour and three (ex. 4).  Records document that he divorced his wife October 2007 (ex.\n4).  Applicant was awarded a high school diploma in 2001 (see ex. 4).\nSince 2001, Applicant has accumulated a number of delinquent debts.  His listed\ndelinquencies appear in virtually all of his credit reports documented in the record (see\nexs. 6 and 8).  His listed debts include three repossessed vehicles: two in 2003 and\nanother in 2005 (ex. 6).  \nBased on the information contained in his January 2008 credit report, Applicant\npurchased a vehicle in July 2002 for $23,443 under an installment agreement he\narranged with the seller (see ex. 6).  He defaulted in his agreement in December 2002,\nand he surrendered the vehicle to the creditor in January 2003 (ex. 6).  Sale of the\nvehicle produced an $8,822 deficiency balance, which the creditor charged off in April\n2005.  The deficiency from this repossession is not reflected in the SOR.  \nApplicant surrendered another vehicle in December 2003 (see ex. 6).  According\nto his January 2008 credit report, he purchased a vehicle in September 2002 from\ncreditor 1.d for approximately $7,213 (see ex. 6).  His credit report shows he defaulted\nin his monthly car payments sometime in 2003.  Following his voluntary surrender of the\nvehicle to the creditor in December 2003, creditor 1.d charged off a debt balance of\n$5,144 in February 2004 (ex. 6).  Whether the seller was able to recover any proceeds\nfrom a public sale is unclear. Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report lists a delinquency\nbalance of $6,787 with creditor 1.d (see ex. 7).  Without any information from Applicant\nto challenge the amount of the reported deficiency by this creditor, inferences warrant\nthat Applicant remains indebted to creditor 1.d for the stated amount ($6,787) in his\nlatest credit report (ex. 7). \nIn 2005, a third creditor (creditor 1. r) repossessed a vehicle from Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s January 2008 credit report indicates he purchased the vehicle in February\n2004 for $7,021 from creditor 1.r, and defaulted  in January 2005, or thereabouts.  \n\n3\nRecords show that creditor 1.r repossessed Applicant\u2019s vehicle in January 2005\n(see exs. 6 and 7).  Although, it is not clear whether the vehicle ever produced any\nproceeds from a public sale, Applicant does not dispute the deficiency owing following\nthe repossession, and offered no documented proof of any sale credits or satisfaction of\nany owed deficiency to the creditor on this account. Inferences warrant, accordingly,\nthat Applicant remains indebted to creditor 1.r for the full amount of the charged off loan\nbalance.\nBesides his major debts associated with his vehicle deficiencies, Applicant\nincurred a number of other debts: some medically-related and others consumer-based.\nThese remaining debts number 17 and exceed $12,000 in aggregate indebtedness.\nHow Applicant came to be indebted to these listed creditors and delinquent in his\npayments is unclear. Applicant provided no documentation of the origins of these debts,\nhis payment history, or how he became delinquent.  All that can be gleaned from the\nexhibits is that Applicant accrued the debts listed in the SOR and documented in the\naccompanying credit reports and ceased paying on them between 2002 and 2005 (see\nexs. 6 and 7).  \nAfforded an opportunity to supplement the FORM, Applicant declined to so. He\nprovided no endorsements or performance evaluations in his behalf.  Nor did he provide\nany proofs of community and civic contributions.\nPolicies\nThe revised AGs (effective September 2006) list guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take\ninto account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual\napplicant, as well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. These guidelines include\n\"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying\nconditions), if any, and all of the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns,\u201d if\nany. These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied.  Although, the guidelines do not\nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 2(a) of the revised\nAGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n4\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\n\n5\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an employee of a defense contractor who accumulated a number\nof delinquent debts (several are related to vehicle repossessions) between 2002 and\n2005. His accumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability and unwillingness to\naddress these debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC)\nof the Guidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c)\n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s pleading admissions of the debts covered in the SOR (sometimes\nreferred to as judicial admissions) negate the need for any independent proof (see\nMcCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (3d ed. 1984)).  Each of Applicant\u2019s listed debts are\nfully documented in his latest credit reports and provide ample independent proof of\nhis debts.\nApplicant\u2019s debts are both unexplained and unresolved. To date, he has not\nmanifested any efforts to address these debts, despite extended opportunities to\nsupplement the FORM materials furnished him. \nWithout any documented payment history or tangible plan to resolve the listed\ndebts, Applicant cannot be credited with any manifest progress to date in regaining\ncontrol of his finances and provides no hard assurances of any commitment to resolve\nhis debts in the foreseeable future.  Applicant\u2019s finances still require a good deal of\neffort on his  part to fully stabilize them. \nBased on the documented materials in the FORM, Applicant has not\ndemonstrated any extenuating circumstances associated with the delinquent debts he\naccrued over several years.  Consequently, MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations\nguideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibility,\u201d\nis not available to him.  Some judgment problems persist, too, over the delinquencies\nhe has failed to explain or address.\nMoreover, even if Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies did arise due to circumstances\noutside of his control, he could have been reasonably expected to address his debts in\na responsible way once the conditions that contributed to the delinquencies had\npassed or eased, and his finances had improved. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App.\nBd. Sep. 24, 2004).  Not only are his listed debt delinquencies ongoing, but he has\nfailed to address them in any visible way.  \n                                                    \n\n6\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  See\nSnepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is\nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While\nthe principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in\nfinancial cases.  Failure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve\nhis (or her) debts when able to do so raises security-significant concerns about the\nsufficiency of the applicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard\nclassified information.\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts (some quite large). Since\ngraduating from high school in 2001, he has not shown any manifest effort in\naddressing any of his covered debts to mitigate his still delinquent accounts.\nResolution of his delinquent accounts is a critical prerequisite to his regaining control\nof his  finances.\nWhile youth, immaturity, and the strains of managing a family household might\nhave played a considerable role in his accumulation of so many debts over a relatively\nshort period, Applicant failed to provide any explanatory material for consideration.\nEndorsements and performance evaluations might have been helpful, too, in making a\nwhole-person assessment of his overall clearance eligibility, but were not provided.\nOverall, clearance eligibility assessment of Applicant based on the  limited amount of\ninformation available for consideration in this record does not enable him to establish\njudgment and trust levels sufficient to enable him to overcome appraised security\nconcerns arising out his accumulation of delinquent debts.\nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, his youth and family commitments, his lack of any\nexhibited explanations for his debt accruals, and his failure to provide any proof of\ncorrective actions taken to address his old debts, it is still soon to make safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore his finances to\nstable levels commensurate with his holding a security clearance. Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a\nthrough 1.s. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the 2(a) factors enumerated in the revised AGs.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n\n7\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCES):         \nAGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR which was received by DOHA on\nMarch 9, 2009, and requested a decision without a hearing (Answer).  Department\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on March 19,\n2009.  The Applicant received the FORM on March 26, 2009, and was given 30 days to\nsubmit any additional information.  He elected not to submit any additional\n\n2\ndocumentation.  The case was assigned to me on May 20, 2009.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 51 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially\noverextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds.  The\nApplicant admitted the factual allegation, but denied that his conduct showed poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant worked for a school system for 20 years.  He was laid off from this\njob in September 2007.  Until he found work with his present employer in June 2008, he\nwas underemployed while trying to find a permanent job.  (Item 5 at question 11.)   \nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owes approximately $16,030.00\nfor a past-due credit card account.  The Applicant states that he was, and is, unable to\nmake payments on this account due to his lack of meaningful employment.  In his\nAnswer to the SOR, the Applicant states that he attempted to work out a payment\narrangement with this creditor, Citi Bank, but was unable to do so.  According to the\nApplicant, Citi has obtained a judgment against the Applicant.  He also stated that, due\nto his continued inability to pay this debt, he may have to declare bankruptcy.  (Item 4.)\nThere is no information that the Applicant has attempted to resolve this debt since being\nemployed by his current employer.\nMitigation\nThe Government\u2019s credit bureau reports show that he has paid off or resolved all\nof his debt other than the credit card debt.  The Applicant submits that this supports his\nargument that he shows good judgment with regards to his debts.  (Items 6 and 7.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\n\n3\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. An\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d is a concern under AG \u00b6 19(a).  Under AG &\n19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may also raise security concerns.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes the debt set forth in SOR subparagraph 1.a, and has\nbeen unable to pay it for two years.  The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose in 2007, due to his layoff.  However, there is no indication that\nhe has taken recent action to resolve this debt since he was employed in June 2008.  It\nis the Applicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that his financial situation has\nimproved.  He has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties seem to be connected to his layoff.\nHowever, once again, there is no evidence that he has made recent attempts to resolve\nthis situation.  I cannot find, under these particular facts, that the Applicant has acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\nFinally, the Applicant is at least $16,000.00 in debt.  Under these facts I cannot\nfind that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\n\n5\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is under financial\nstrain, and has been for two years.  He has not made a sufficient showing that his debt\nsituation is under control.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based\non the state of the record, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral\nchanges under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I cannot find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)), or that\nthe likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations at this time.  If he resolves this major debt in an acceptable, legal, way\nhe may be eligible for a clearance in the future.  He is not eligible now.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST  THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by her own admission, has over $28,000.00 in past\ndue debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 2004 and 2006.  However, it took her\nuntil 2008 to begin the negotiations to pay off any of the past due indebtedness.  In\naddition, the evidence is meager as to how much she has paid.  It is the Applicant\u2019s\nburden to submit evidence showing that her financial situation has improved.  She has\nnot done so.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties seem to be\nconnected with her failed business.  However, once again, she did not make any\nattempts to resolve this situation until after being contacted by DOHA.  I cannot find,\nunder these particular facts, that the Applicant has acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\n\n6\nThe Applicant has barely initiated a good-faith effort to pay off her creditors.\nEven taking her word that she has paid the debts in 1.h. and 1.k., that amounts to only\n$354.00.  In addition, while it appears her husband was making the required payments\nthrough September 2008 on the debt in subparagraph 1.a., there is no evidence to\nshow that he has continued the payments for another six months.  In conclusion, there\nis no track record of her making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly,\nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  \nFinally, the Applicant is at least $28,000.00 in debt.  Under these facts I cannot\nfind that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is under financial\nstrain, and has been for several years.  She has not made a sufficient showing that her\ndebt situation is under control.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.\nBased on the state of the record, I cannot find that there have been permanent\nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I cannot find\nthat there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6\n2(a)8), or that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations at this time.  If she continues to pay down her debts, and is able to\ndocument these payments, she may be eligible for a clearance in the future.  She is not\neligible now.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\n\n7\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On December 30, 2008, she \ncompleted a Standard Form 86 Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  \n \nMarch 12, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 23, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to another \nadministrative judge on October 6, 2009, and re-assigned it to me on October 13, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 10, 2009. The hearing convened as \nscheduled on January 7, 2010.2 Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 6 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through F into the record without objection. The record remained open \nuntil January 22, 2010, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit any additional relevant \ninformation. Applicant did not submit additional evidence and the record closed as \npreviously ordered.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 19, \n2010. \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nLebanon. (Tr.11; 25.) The request and the attached documents are included in the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 with attachments I through XX. Applicant did not object \nto consideration of those exhibits. (Tr. 11; 25.) Hence, the facts administratively noticed \nare limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute. The facts administratively noticed (incorporated from those documents) are set \nout in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. a, 1.b, and \n2.a through 2.g. She denied the allegations contained in \u00b6 2.h. Her admissions are \nincluded herein as findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and divorced. She was born in Lebanon and earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree from a university there in July 1991. After graduation, she worked for \nan international not-for-profit for two years. (Tr. 28.) In 1993, she reconnected with an \nAmerican man she previously met in Lebanon. They became engaged and she came to \nthe United States in August 1993 on a fianc\u00e9e visa. They married in September 1993 \nand divorced in March 1998.  (GE1.) They have a 13-year-old daughter, who was born \nin the United States. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1998. (GE \n2.) She relinquished her Lebanese passport in 1998 and uses her U.S. passport for \ntravel. (Tr. 32.) \n                                            \n2The scheduling of this hearing was delayed for a period of time due to Applicant\u2019s illness. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nFrom January 1996 until May 1997, Applicant worked as a teaching assistant for \na professor at a U.S. university. Subsequently, she worked in private industry in the field \nof information technology until August 2004, when she decided to return to Lebanon to \nlive and raise her daughter with the help of her family. (Tr. 46.) While there, she worked \nin her oldest brother\u2019s business. (Tr. 66.) In July 2006, she left Lebanon and returned to \nthe United States with her daughter because of the conflict between Lebanon and \nIsrael. Her mother\u2019s home was almost destroyed in that war. (Tr. 46-47.) \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Lebanon.  Her father is deceased. He \nwas a member of the legislature. (GE 2; Tr. 51.) Her mother is a dual citizen of Lebanon \nand the United States. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2009. She \nprimarily resides in Lebanon, but spends time with Applicant in the United States. (Tr. \n51.) She intends to immigrate here with Applicant\u2019s younger, disabled brother. (Tr. 70.)  \n \n \nApplicant is one of seven children, all born in Lebanon. Her six siblings are \ncitizens of, and reside in, Lebanon. Her oldest brother owns a business. He obtained an \nadvanced degree from a U.S. university. He started an institute in Lebanon in 2004. \nApplicant and her oldest brother communicate frequently. He visits her in the United \nStates. (GE 6 at 3, 5; Tr. 59-60.) Applicant made a one-time donation of $100 to the \ninstitute November 2007. She did not make regular contributions. (GE 6 at 4.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second oldest brother is employed by a Lebanese university. They \nhave some contact. (GE 6 at 7.) The third oldest brother is a self-employed civil \nengineer. This brother visited her in the United States in December 2007 while she was \nill. (GE 6 at 7.) The fourth oldest brother is 42 years old and unemployed. He lives with \nApplicant\u2019s mother in Lebanon. (Tr. 58.) Applicant has frequent contact with him. (GE 6 \nat 7.) Applicant\u2019s oldest sister is a housewife with four children. Her brother-in-law is \ndeceased. She speaks to this sister every couple months. (Tr. 58; GE 6 at 9.) The \nyoungest sister is a homemaker and works for her brother\u2019. She has some contact with \nher. (Tr. 59; GE 6 at 9.) Applicant also has two close friends that live in Lebanon, both \nof whom she regularly contacts. (Tr. 63, 66, 81.)  \n \n \nThe weight of the evidence supports a finding that the incident involving \nApplicant being involuntarily contacted by a person suspected of terrorist affiliation did \noccur, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.h.3 (Tr. 50; GE 3 at 3.) \n \n \nThree months after returning to the United States from her two-year stay in \nLebanon, Applicant applied for a linguist position with a defense contractor. In October \n2006, she was hired to work with the U.S. Army. In that capacity, she worked in Iraq for \ntwo periods of time: from January 2007 to October 2007, and January 2009 to July \n2009.  In October 2007, she was diagnosed with cancer and returned to the United \nStates for treatment. She completed medical therapy in May 2008. She remained in the \nUnited States until January 2009, when she resumed her work in Iraq. (Tr. 41.) In July \n                                            \n3The details surrounding this incident that are contained in the record were not recited in the \ndecision in order to protect Applicant\u2019s privacy interests. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n2009, she returned to the United States after receiving the SOR. (Tr. 42.) Currently, she \nis on medical leave due to the possible recurrence of cancer.  (Tr. 79.)  \n \n \nSince arriving in the United States in 1993, Applicant has traveled to Lebanon \ntwice a year to see her family, except during the time she was working in Iraq. (Tr. 45.) \nShe enters Lebanon on her U.S. passport and uses a Lebanese Identification Card (ID), \nissued in 2002, as a visa, making travel in and out of the country easier.4 (GE 6 at 7.) \nThe last time she used the ID card was in October 2009. She is willing to relinquish the \nID card, if necessary. (Tr. 34; 67.)  She intends to continue visiting Lebanon in the \nfuture, but not while she works in Iraq. (Tr. 69.) She always registers with the American \nembassy in Lebanon before traveling there. (Tr. 54.) \n \n \nIn 2009, Applicant traveled to Lebanon twice. She and her daughter went in July \nand stayed until September 2009. She returned in October and came home in \nDecember 2009. She stayed with her mother both times, while she was recovering from \ncancer treatment. (Tr. 53.) During one of these visits, the State Department issued a \ntravel warning for Americans in Lebanon, unbeknownst to her. (Tr. 56.) She would \nconsider any similar warnings in the future before returning. (Tr. 57.) She acknowledged \nthat there are dangerous areas in Lebanon that she does not visit because of the \npresence of terrorists. (Tr. 65.)  \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members work for the Lebanese government. None of \nthem belong to terrorist organizations or has been approached by terrorists. (Tr. 69.) All \nof them support U.S. policies and goals. (GE 6 at 12.) Her family knows that she works \nfor the U.S. Government, but does not know that she works in Iraq. (Tr. 67; 84.) Such \nknowledge could jeopardize their safety in Lebanon because her family resides in a \nterrorist stronghold. (GE 6 at 12.)  \n \n \nApplicant owns a home in the United States. She does not own property in \nLebanon. (Tr. 67.) She does not have any foreign investments. (Tr. 68.) She does not \nprovide financial assistance to her family in Lebanon. (Tr. 68.) She donated $50 to her \nuniversity alma mater one time more than 15 years ago, but not annually as alleged in \nthe SOR. (Tr. 32; GE 7.) \n  \n \nApplicant speaks French, Arabic, and English. (Tr. 39.) She uses those language \nand computer skills in her linguist position. (Tr. 43.) She held an Interim Secret \nclearance until it was revoked pending this proceeding. (Tr. 79) There is no evidence \nthat she has been disciplined for violating security rules or procedures.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted five letters of recommendation from her supervisors and \ncolleagues, who have known her over the past three years. All of them provided \nextremely and exclusively positive comments concerning her professionalism, integrity, \nand performance. Her direct supervisor most strongly recommended her for positions of \n                                            \n4 Lebanon requires passports and visas to enter and exit the country. American citizens traveling \nthere for tourism are able to purchase a short-term visa at the country\u2019s border. (HE II.)   \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nresponsibility, trust, and importance. (AE A, B.) Three other linguist colleagues attest to \nher exceptional skills and work ethic. (AE D, E, F.) \n  \n \nThroughout the hearing, Applicant credibly asserted her pride of U.S. citizenship \nand loyalty to the United States.  She has no allegiance to Lebanon. (Tr. 82.) Her \ncommand is aware of her Lebanese family and that she emails them while working in \nIraq. (Tr. 84.) \n \nLebanon \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which people have the constitutional \nright to change their government. It has a unicameral legislature, and a president \nelected by the legislature.  Its major elected officials have been allocated among the \nvarious religious and ethnic groups for many years, according to the Constitution and a \nlong-ago negotiated agreement among all the parties. Lebanon is located at the eastern \nend of the Mediterranean Sea in the Middle East area. It operated under a French \nmandate between World War I and II.  It was peaceful until a civil war erupted in 1975 \nbetween various religious factions. Due to this civil war the full exercise of political rights \nwas precluded from 1975 until 1991. Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong \nlaissez-faire commercial tradition. Historically, the Lebanese have been traders \nthroughout the Mediterranean. The economy is service-oriented. The U.S. enjoys a \nstrong export position with Lebanon and is its fifth largest source of imported goods. \nMore than 160 offices representing U.S. businesses operate in Lebanon. Since the \nlifting of passport restrictions in 1997, a number of large U.S. companies have opened \nbranch or regional offices in Lebanon.  \n \nThe foreign policy of Lebanon reflects its geographic location, the composition of \nits population, and its reliance on commerce and trade. Its foreign policy is heavily \ninfluenced by neighboring Syria, which has also long influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal \npolicies. For over 10 years, Syrian troops occupied part of Lebanon, and controlled its \ninternal politics and policies.  About three years ago, Syria was forced to withdraw its \ntroops because of Lebanese opposition expressed in a popular uprising against the \nSyrian presence. Syria maintains some influence in Lebanon. The U.S. State \nDepartment has declared Syria to be a supporter of terrorism. Lebanon, like most Arab \nstates, does not recognize Israel, with which it has been technically at war since Israel\u2019s \nestablishment. Lebanon has had some human rights problems, including the arbitrary \narrest and detainment of individuals and instances of arbitrary and unlawful deprivation \nof life, torture, and other abuses. \n \nThe terrorist group Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based radical Shi\u2019a group and is \ndesignated by the U.S. as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d It is allied to and \nsupported by the Iranian Government. The Lebanese government recognizes Hezbollah \nas a \u201clegitimate resistance group and political party,\u201d and until recently it was \nrepresented by elected officials in the Lebanese parliament. Hezbollah also provides \nsupport to several Palestinian terrorist organizations and is known to be involved in \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nnumerous anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli terrorist attacks. Americans have been the targets of \nnumerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon.  \n \n \nThe United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon and \nto help preserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity. \nThe U.S. provides more than $400 million in aid to Lebanon and pledged $1 billion in \nadditional aid. The aid reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to Lebanon\u2019s \ndevelopment as a unified, independent, and sovereign country. \n \n \nU.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to laws that \nimpose special obligations on them as Lebanese citizens. Presently there is a travel \nwarning for U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon due to the threat against westerners. \n \nPOLICIES \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nANALYSIS \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \nAG \u00b6 9 sets forth the security concern involving foreign preference: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business \ninterests in another country; \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and, \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and, \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \nApplicant\u2019s actions in obtaining and maintaining a valid Lebanese ID card raise \nsecurity concerns under \u00b6 10(a) and \u00b6 10(b).  She was born a Lebanese citizen, but \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1998. Obtaining a Lebanese ID card in 2002 and maintaining it \nfor the past seven years is an action to acquire recognition of her continuing Lebanese \ncitizenship by the Lebanese government and an exercise of a foreign right after \nreceiving U.S. citizenship.  \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority;  \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and, \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \nApplicant clearly asserted that she would willingly renounce or surrender her \nLebanese ID card. AG \u00b6 11(b) applies. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the government\u2019s concern about foreign \ninfluence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and 5  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n  \nSince 1993, Applicant has had frequent personal and telephonic contact with her \nmother and six siblings, who are residents and citizens of Lebanon. Although Lebanon \nhas had a close relationship with the United States for many years, it also continues to \nhave human rights issues and has been victimized by terrorist organizations and \nattacks. Applicant\u2019s family resides in an area that is controlled by a terrorist \norganization. These facts create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure or coercion, and a potential conflict of interest between her \nobligation to protect sensitive information and desire to help her native country and \nfamily members there.  Legitimate security concerns are raised under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b). \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those with \npotential application to the disqualifying conditions are: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n                                            \n5 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members work for the Lebanese Government. In their \nemployment positions, it is improbable that any of them would have any interest in \nacquiring protected information. However, their physical presence in a terrorist-\ncontrolled section of Lebanon creates a substantial potential that their interests could be \nthreatened to the point that Applicant would confront a choice between her family\u2019s \ninterests and those of the United States, particularly if her employment became known \nto the terrorists. Based on that fact, and Applicant\u2019s strong familial relationships and \nfrequent visits, Applicant could foreseeably be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of her family and those of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not \nhave application.  \n \nApplicant produced evidence warranting a partial application of AG \u00b6 8(b).  She \nacknowledged her loyalty and allegiance to the United States and could be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. She moved to the United \nStates in 1993 and became a naturalized citizen in 1998. She has held various jobs \nover the years. Her daughter is a U.S. citizen and resident.  Her mother is a naturalized \nU.S. citizen, periodically residing in the United States. Applicant owns a home in the \nUnited States. She receives medical care in the United States, which is important, given \nher recent medical issues. For two years she performed with excellence as a translator \nfor the U.S. Army.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply because Applicant has consistently visited and \ncommunicated with her mother and siblings since 1993, such that her communication \nand contacts cannot be construed to be casual or infrequent, as required under this \ncondition. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors (APF) listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are as follows:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole-person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; \nand many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \n \nFive circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole-person analysis.  First, \nthere is a significant risk of terrorism and various human rights abuses in Lebanon, \ndespite its ally status with the United States. More importantly for security purposes, \nApplicant\u2019s family lives in an area controlled by terrorists, who are hostile to the United \nStates and may seek classified information. Such terrorists could attempt to use \nApplicant\u2019s siblings or mother to obtain classified information if they became aware of \nher employment with the U.S. Army. Second, she personally encountered the presence \nof suspected terrorists. Third, she had numerous connections to Lebanon before leaving \nit in 1993. Following her birth, she spent her formative years there, along with her \nfamily. She graduated from a university located there. Fourth, her siblings and mother \nare residents and citizens of Lebanon. Fifth, she has frequent contact with her family \nand two close friends there, including yearly visits and a previous extended stay from \n2004 to 2006. She, understandably, relies on them for support during her unfortunate \nmedical problems.   \n \nSome mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. First, she is a mature person, who came to the United States in 1993 to start \na family. She has been a naturalized citizen for almost twelve years. She has worked for \na university and private companies while in the United States.  Second, her daughter \nwas born in the United States and resides here. Her mother is a recently naturalized \nU.S. citizen. Third, she has a strong sense of patriotism toward the United States and \ndecided to support the United States in its efforts in Iraq. Her co-workers praise her as \nloyal and honest, and consider her work important. Those are commendable and \nnoteworthy accomplishments in her life. However, in balancing both sets of factors, her \nties and connections to Lebanon remain strong and deep. Her decision to frequently \nreturn to Lebanon, despite valid concerns for the safety of her family given her \nemployment in Iraq, heightens the potential for risk and causes further security concern.    \n \n\n \n \n \n \n12\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference, but not those arising under foreign \ninfluence and the whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n       For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.h:  \n       Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Attorney At Law\nOctober 28, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on July 24, 2006.  (Government Exhibits 1 and 2). On May 11, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 2, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on July 8, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 13, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for August 20, 2009.  Applicant requested an earlier date, and the\nmatter was rescheduled on July 15, 2009, and set for August 19, 2009.  The\nGovernment offered three exhibits referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which\n\n2\nwere received without objection.  Applicant called three witnesses and offered fifteen\nexhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through O, which were admitted into\nevidence without objection.  She also testified on her own behalf.  The transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) was received on August 26, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nREQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in South Korea that were set\nforth in Administrative Notice documents 1 through 15.  Applicant had no objection to\ndocuments 1 through 8 and 12, 13 and 15.  (Tr. pp. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, and 25).\nApplicant objected to Administrative Notice documents 9 through 11 and 14, but was\noverruled.  (Tr. pp.  23, 25, 26, 27 and 28).  The request and the attached documents\nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 29 years of age and has a Master\u2019s of\nScience degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics.  She is employed as a Guidance and\nControl Engineer by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with her employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of\nclassified information.\nThe Applicant was born in the United States in 1980, to parents from South\nKorea.  She is not a dual citizen of Korea and possesses only a United States passport.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  She is married to an American citizen.  She was raised in the\nUnited States, and obtained her Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees from a prestigious\nUniversity in the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits I and J).  She considers herself\nindependent and self-sufficient.  She participates in the political process in the United\nStates, and her loyalties lie with the United States.           \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother, father and grandmother are citizens and residents of\nSouth Korea.  Her mother is and has always been a housewife.  Although she resides in\nKorea, her mother became a naturalized United States citizen in 1987.  Applicant\u2019s father\nis currently the Chief Executive Officer for a large Korean pharmaceutical corporation.\nThe Applicant stated, \u201cMy father\u2019s job and his life is separate from my own.  It is\n\n3\nunderstood in my family  that I have no obligations toward them, financial or otherwise.\u201d\n(Tr. p. 68).  The Applicant communicates with her mother about two to three times a\nweek.  Her contact with her father is not as frequent, about once or twice a month by\ntelephone.  She maintained contact with her grandmother in Korea up until she started\nher current job.  Due to her busy schedule now, she no longer maintains regular contact\nwith her grandmother.  She last contacted her grandmother in 2007, and has not talked\nto her since then. (Tr. p. 65).  The Applicant has aunts and uncles in South Korea, but\ntalks to them at most about once a year by telephone.  The Applicant has one sister who\nis a jewelry designer who resides in Paris, France.  (Tr. p. 70).  The Applicant has told\nnone of her family in South Korea that she is applying for a security clearance with DoD\nand has no intentions of ever discussing the issue with them.  None of her family\nmembers in South Korea are associated with the Korean Government in any way.\nThe Applicant\u2019s parents visit the United States about once a year on average.  In\ntwo years, when the Applicant\u2019s father retires from his position, her parents plan to\npermanently move to the United States to be near the Applicant and her family here.      \nIn 1999, at the age of eighteen, the Applicant applied for and was accepted to a\nprogram that was sponsored by a Korean-American Scientist and Engineering\nAssociation for a summer internship with the Korean Aerospace Research Institute in\nSouth Korea.  She applied for the program in order to learn more about the Korean\nculture.  (Tr. p. 66).     \nSince 1999, the Applicant has traveled to South Korea on an annual basis to visit\nher parents.  Her most recent trip was in December 2007.  She has no future plans to\ntravel to Korea.  She understands her responsibilities to the United States Government\nwhile holding a security clearance.  During her trips to Korea in the past, at no time was\nshe approached, contacted, or received requests or threats from or by any person or\norganization from Korea or any other foreign country.  (Tr. p. 61).  She would report any\nsuch contact to her security department and/or the proper authorities.  The Applicant has\nalways complied with her employer\u2019s travel reporting requirements. (Tr. p. 70).  She does\nnot discuss her job in the United States with her parents.  (Tr. p. 59).     \nA manager, who has daily contact with the Applicant at work testified that the\nApplicant is a \u201cstellar performer.\u201d  Out of 40 employees that he is in charge of, the\nApplicant is considered to be one of his top performers.  She is described as, \u201chonest\nand reliable.\u201d  She exhibits no vices or lapses in personal behavior.  This manager has\nno reservations about recommending her for a position of trust.  (Tr. pp. 36 - 44).\nA section leader, who has input in the Applicant\u2019s annual performance appraisal,\ntestified that the Applicant is one of the highest ranked for her skill level in the\norganization.  (Tr. p. 47). \nThe Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that because of his wife\u2019s patriotism and love for\nthe United States, her country, he does not believe that she would ever inappropriately\ndisclose classified information to anyone under any circumstances.  (Tr. p. 53).\n\n4\nLetters of recommendation from the vice president of engineering, mangers,\nfriends and other professional colleagues of the Applicant attest to her dedication,\nenthusiasm and hardworking nature.  She is said to be a woman of honesty, reliability\nand integrity in all aspects of her life.  She is considered to be a valuable member of the\ngroup and is recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C, D, L and\nM ).\nPerformance appraisals of the Applicant for 2006, 2007 and 2008, reflect that she\n\u201cmeets\u201d or \u201cexceeds\u201d performance requirements in every category, except one where\nshe rates in the outstanding category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F, G and H).\nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in South\nKorea.  Following the Korean War, South Korea has experienced political turmoil that\nincluded autocratic leadership, restriction of political freedoms, military coups,\ndeclarations of martial law, and violent confrontations.  Currently, South Korea is a\nstable, democratic republic.  The South Korean Government has generally respected the\nhuman rights of its citizens, however, reported human rights problems include: societal\ndiscrimination against women, persons with disabilities and minorities, domestic violence\nand rape, child abuse, and trafficking in persons.  South Korea has a history of collecting\nprotected U.S. information and in the past has centered its collection efforts on computer\nsystems, aerospace technologies and nuclear technologies, and its activities have\nincluded stealing information from computerized databases maintained by U.S.\ngovernment agencies. \n     \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should\nbe followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions\nare neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they\nsupersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.  Because\neach security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot\nbe assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally\nin every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most\napplicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\n\n5\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion; \n7.  (b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\ntheses persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest;\n8.  (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct;\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n\n6\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed\nin Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole\nperson concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence) that\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a\nrational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and\nhis ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of\nproof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Foreign influence\ncan raise  questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the\ninterests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must\n\n7\nbe able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by\nall security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Conditions 7.(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and 7.(b)\nconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 8.(a) the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which theses persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.,  8.(b)\nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\nand 8.(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also\napply.\nIt is acknowledged that the Applicant\u2019s mother, father, grandmother and extended\nfamily members are citizens of and reside in South Korea.  Although her contact with her\nparents occurs more frequently than with her other relatives, she has clearly established\nthat those contacts are casual and pose no security risk whatsoever.  Her mother is a\nUnited States citizen and her father, although a Chief Executive Officer for a Korean\ncorporation, plans to retire in the United States in two years.  Her sister in Paris, France\nand her extended family members in Korea, have no association with, or any allegiance\nto the Korean Government, nor does the Applicant.  It is noted that the current political\nsituation in South Korea elevates the cause for concern in this case.  However, in this\ncase, the Applicant is a native born American citizen who has lived in the United States\nher entire life.  Her husband is also an American citizen.  Her parents just happen to be\nKorean.  The Applicant is a product of the American culture and its values.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, the possibility of foreign influence does not exist nor could it\ncreate the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  I\n\n8\nfind that the Applicant is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may properly safeguard classified information.  The Applicant is a bright\nyoung engineer who has a promising future with the Defense Department.  Her favorable\nevidence, including testimony and letters from her manager and other professional\nassociates, her performance appraisals and her overall integrity gleaned from her own\ntestimony, demonstrate her trustworthiness.  She has presented sufficient evidence in\nmitigation to demonstrate that she is not a  security risk.\n     \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.e.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.f.:  For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.g.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n\n9\n \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 28, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July \n24, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 3, 2009, scheduling the hearing \nNovember 18, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nfor August 18, 2009. The case was reassigned to me on August 12, 2009. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nSeptember 2, 2009.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \nOn my own motion and without objection from either party, I amended the SOR \nto reflect the correct spelling of Applicant\u2019s name. \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about Russia. Applicant did not object and the request was approved. \nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The facts administratively noticed are \nset out in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. GE 1 through 5 were \nreceived without objection. GE 6 was admitted over Applicant\u2019s objection. I have \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s objection in determining the weight accorded to GE 6. Applicant \ntestified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were received \nwithout objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She was born in \nRussia, in what was then the Soviet Union. She is seeking a security clearance for the \nfirst time. She has worked for her current employer as a Russian linguist since 2007, but \nhas been employed in the same geographic location in similar capacities for other \ndefense contractors since 2000. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree from a Russian university \nand completed post-graduate courses at an American university. She was married to a \nRussian citizen from 1985 until her divorce in 1993. She married a U.S. citizen in 1994. \nThat marriage ended in divorce in 2004. She is engaged to be married to a U.S. citizen \nwho is a member of the military reserves. She has a 24-year-old daughter from her first \nmarriage and a 15-year-old child from her second marriage.1  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 23, 26-27, 30-31, 33-34, 42; GE 1-3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant met a member of the U.S. military while she was visiting Germany in \n1993 or 1994. She married him and moved from Russia to Germany in 1994. Her \ndaughter moved to Germany to live with her, but she only stayed about a month. She \ndid not like living in Germany, and she moved back to Russia to live with her father and \nApplicant\u2019s parents. Applicant\u2019s second child was born while she was in Germany. \nApplicant moved to the U.S. with her second husband and child in about 1997. She \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2000.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and daughter are citizens and residents of Russia. Her \nparents are both in their early 70\u2019s. Her father is a retired musician and teacher. He was \na member of the Communist Party. He became disillusioned and quit the party in about \nthe late 1990s. Her mother teaches music and English. Applicant\u2019s daughter is a \nstudent. She is not married.3 \n \n \nApplicant visited her parents and daughter in Russia for about three weeks in \n2007. That is her only trip to Russia since she immigrated to the United States. Her \nyounger child has not been to Russia. Her parents visited Applicant and her younger \nchild in the United States in the 1990s, and again in 2000. Her daughter in Russia does \nnot speak English, and she has never traveled to the United States. She plans to visit \nApplicant in the United States, but they do not have a date for her trip. Applicant \ncontacts her parents by phone about twice a month and periodically by e-mail. She has \nregular contact with her daughter by e-mail and occasionally by telephone.4 \n \n \nApplicant credibly denied that she told an investigator in a 2002 interview that a \nthreat against her family members in Russia could be used to coerce or compromise \nher.5 She stated in response to DOHA interrogatories: \n \nI had not considered it a possibility but if coercion were applied to myself \nor my family or friends, I would notify proper U.S. officials including my \nDoD contract project manager and security forces.6 \n \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. She owns a house in the United \nStates. She views Russia as the country of her birth and has affection for the Russian \npeople, but her loyalty and allegiance are to the United States.7  \n \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 24, 27-31; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 24-29; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 28, 32-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 19, 40-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n6 GE 3. \n \n7 Tr. at 40, 42-43. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters from her supervisor and a colleague who is also her \nfriend. The supervisor lauded her superior job performance. The colleague attested to \nApplicant\u2019s character, patriotism, and dedication to the United States.8  \n \n \nThe Russian Federation \n \nThe Russian Federation is composed of 21 republics. The government consists \nof a strong president, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature and a weak judiciary. It is \na vast and diverse country with a population of 142 million people. It achieved \nindependence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991. It is a \nnuclear superpower that continues to develop politically, socially, and economically. \n \nThe United States and Russia share certain common strategic interests. Of \nmutual interest to the United States and Russia are counterterrorism and the reduction \nof strategic arsenals. Russia and the United States share a common interest in \ncontrolling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CRT) program was launched in 1992 to \nprovide for the dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet \nUnion. The CRT program was renewed in 2006 for seven years, until 2013. \n \n \nSince 2003, U.S.-Russian relations have often been strained. Tensions between \nthe United States and Russia increased in August 2008, when Russia sent its army \nacross an internationally recognized boundary in an attempt to change by force the \nborders of Georgia, a country with a democratically-elected government. Russia\u2019s \nassault on Georgia followed other troubling signs: threats against Poland, including the \nthreat of nuclear attack; suspicious poisonings and killings of journalists and those \ndeemed \u201cundesirable,\u201d including the President of Ukraine; the apparent use of energy \nresources to apply political pressure against Ukraine, Lithuania, and the Czech \nRepublic; and the creation in Russia\u2019s state-controlled media of an \u201cenemy image\u201d of \nthe United States.  \n \nThe Russian Federation\u2019s intelligence capability is significant and focuses on \ncollection of information from the United States. Russia has targeted U.S. technologies \nand has sought to obtain protected information from them through industrial espionage. \nRussian espionage specializes in military technology and gas and oil industry expertise. \nAs of 2005, Russia and China were the two most aggressive collectors of sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology and accounted for the majority of such targeting. Russia is a \nleading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and military-related \ntechnology to China, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela. \n \nThe threat of terrorism in Russia continues to be significant. Travel in the vicinity \nof Chechnya may be dangerous, despite Russian efforts to suppress the terrorists. Acts \nof terrorism include taking hostages and bombings.  \n \n                                                          \n8 AE A, B. \n\n \n5 \n \nRussia has recognized the legitimacy of international human rights standards, \nbut human rights abuses continue. Both Russian federal forces and Chechen rebel \nforces \nact \nwith \nimpunity \nwhile \nengaging \nin \ntorture, \nsummary \nexecutions, \ndisappearances, and arbitrary detentions. Additional problems include corruption, media \nsuppression, life-threatening prison conditions, and corruption in law enforcement.  \n \nThe U.S. Department of State reports allegations that Russian government \nofficials and others conduct warrantless searches of residences and other premises and \nelectronic surveillance without judicial permission. This surveillance includes Ministry of \nInternal Affairs and Federal Security Office monitoring of internet and e-mail traffic.  \nAdditionally, Russian law enforcement agencies have legal access to the personal \ninformation of users of telephone and cell phone services.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \n\n \n6 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and daughter are citizens and residents of Russia. Russia is \na diplomatic and strategic partner of the United States in some areas where both \ncountries have mutual interests. For example, Russia is a key partner in efforts to \nreduce proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and control of nuclear materials. \nHowever, Russia is also one of the world\u2019s most aggressive nations in the collection of \n\n \n7 \n \nU.S. intelligence and sensitive economic information. Applicant\u2019s family members\u2019 \npresence in Russia creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant\u2019s father is a former member of the Communist \nParty. That is a fact and circumstance included in the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cparents are citizens and residents of Russia.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for \nApplicant.  \n \n \nApplicant has visited Russia once since she has immigrated to the United States. \nThat does not raise security concerns independent of those raised by her family\u2019s \npresence in Russia. SOR \u00b6 1.d is concluded for Applicant.  \n \n \nThe government has not established that Applicant told an investigator in a 2002 \ninterview that a threat against her family members in Russia could be used to coerce or \ncompromise her. That information, even if established, would be a fact and \ncircumstance included in the allegations that Applicant\u2019s parents and daughter are \ncitizens and residents of Russia. SOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant is clearly a loyal U.S. citizen with no allegiance to the government of \nRussia. However, because of her close family ties to Russia and the nature of the \ngovernment of Russia, I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable to the security concerns related to her parents and daughter.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Russia. Her parents and \ndaughter are citizens and residents of Russia. Her father is no longer a member of the \nCommunist Party. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the \nforeign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Russia engaged in armed conflict \nwith a democracy friendly with the United States; it has human rights issues; it has been \nvictimized by terrorism; and it is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. The complicated relationship of Russia to the United States places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her immediate family \nmembers in Russia do not pose a security risk. Applicant is obviously an intelligent, \nhonest, trustworthy, and loyal U.S. citizen. She simply was unable to mitigate the \nconsiderable security concerns raised by her family in Russia. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Foreign Influence security concerns. \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nSeptember 28, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 20, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on July 21, \n2009, and issued a Notice of Hearing on July 29, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on August 19, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into \nevidence, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibit \n(AE) 1 (consisting of 47 pages) into evidence. I admitted Applicant\u2019s exhibit without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 27, 2009.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 18-19) The request and the attached documents are \nincluded in the record as Government Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through VI. Applicant did \nnot object to my consideration of those Exhibits. The facts administratively noticed are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated may 20, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f of the SOR.   \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. He was born in a northern part of Iraq, commonly \nreferred to as the Kurdish area. He attended high school and undergraduate college \nthere, receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in Kurdish languages in 1990. He speaks English, \nFarsi, and Arabic. From 1991 to 1994, he worked for a Kurdish reconstruction company. \nFrom 1994 to 1996, he worked for a Swedish company doing business in the Kurdish \narea. At some point, Saddam Hussein decided that any citizen who worked for a foreign \ncompany should be executed. (GE 2 at 5) \n \n \nIn December 1996, Applicant, his wife, and their two children sought asylum in \nthe United States. Applicant and his family stayed in Guam until April 1997, when they \nentered the United States through an affiliation with a religious social services \norganization. (GE 2 at 5) In December 2004, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. His \nwife became a naturalized U. S. citizen in February 2004, and his two children became \nU.S. citizens in June 2005. Another child was born in the United States in 2001. His wife \nand children live with him in the United States. His wife obtained an advanced degree \nfrom a U.S. university where she works. (Tr. 45) \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Iraq. His father is 68 years old and a \nretired farmer. He receives a pension from the Iraqi government. His mother is 67 years \nold and a homemaker. They are citizens and residents of the Kurdish area in Iraq. \nApplicant filed a U.S. Immigration Petition for Relative for his mother and father in \nNovember 2005. (AE 1 at 34, 35) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nApplicant is one of eight children, all born in Iraq. One of his siblings is deceased. \nOne of his brothers is a U.S. permanent resident alien, residing in the United States. \nAnother brother is residing in Denmark while awaiting citizenship there. His third brother \nis a resident and citizen of northern Iraq. He is a school principal for a public school. In \nSeptember 2006, Applicant filed a U.S. Immigration Petition for Relative on his behalf \nand hopes that he will be able to come to the United States. (AE 1 at 36) His fourth \nbrother is also a resident and citizen of northern Iraq. He is a lawyer and worked with \nthe U.S. Army as a local interpreter from 2003 to 2004. (Tr. 79) In November 2005, \nApplicant filed a U.S Immigration Petition for Relative on behalf of this brother. (AE 1 at \n34) His two sisters are residents and citizens of a city in northern Iraq. They are \nhomemakers and their husbands work for a company that removes mines placed in the \nground during the Iran/Iraq war. (Tr. 67) None of these relatives works directly for the \nIraqi government. (Tr. 42-45) Applicant speaks to his parents a couple times a month. \nHe emails his siblings once or twice a month and sometimes calls them. (Tr. 62)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are residents and citizens of Iraq. His \nmother-in-law is a homemaker, and his father-in-law is retired from a city worker \nposition. (Tr. 44) He has some type of pension from the city. (Tr. 71) His wife\u2019s two \nbrothers are residents and citizens of Iraq. (Tr. 45) One of her brothers works for a U.S. \nbank and the other brother is a policeman. (Tr. 46) His sister-in-law is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. (Tr. 54) His wife contacts her family once or twice a month. (Tr. 63) Applicant \nhas more limited contact with his in-laws. (GE 2 at 8) None of Applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily members or in-laws has been approached or threatened by the Iraqi government \nor any terrorist organization. (Tr. 80) These in-laws reside in the Kurdish section of Iraq. \nApplicant does not have contact with anyone living in Iraq other than family members. \n(GE 2 at 8) \n \n \nAfter arriving in the United States, Applicant worked for a pizza parlor before \nsecuring a position as a health information analyst with a university hospital. He worked \nfor the hospital for ten years, during which time he had access to confidential \ninformation. (Tr. 29) In October 2007, he applied for a position with a federal contractor \nas an Iraqi cultural advisor. In December 2007, he deployed with the U.S. Army to Iraq \nfor 15 months. (Tr. 30-31) While there, he found himself in dangerous situations while \ntraveling the countryside to gather information. He said at times he closed his eyes and \n\u201cwasn\u2019t sure I can open my eyes again.\u201d (Tr. 35) Prior to going to Iraq, he received an \ninterim Secret security clearance. In describing the reason he decided to work with the \nArmy, he stated that he wanted to help the United States because this country gave him \n\u201cnew life.\u201d (Tr. 31)  \n \n \nApplicant returned to Iraq to visit his family in March 2001 and September 2005. \n(Tr. 47) He did not visit his family while he was there with the U.S. Army, as mandated \nby his employer. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 48) He was permitted to phone them. (Tr. 48) His family \nknew that he was working for the United States, but had little information about his \nposition. (Tr. 50)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \nApplicant owns a house in the United States. He also has U. S. bank accounts. \n(Tr. 46) He does not own any property in Iraq. (Id.) There is no derogatory information \nconcerning his police or financial records. He has never been fired from a job. He has \nnever been arrested. He has never used illegal drugs or been involved in an alcohol-\nrelated incident. (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant submitted several exhibits attesting to his capabilities and contributions \nto the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 efforts in the war on terror. According to his performance \nevaluations for the time period of January 2008 to June 2008, Applicant\u2019s job \nperformance was outstanding, exceeding expectations. (AE 1 at 14-19) One of his \nsupervisors stated that Applicant\u2019s \u201ccultural and political awareness throughout the \nvarious levels of the human terrain that exists has proven essential to the \naccomplishment of client mission requirements.\u201d(AE 1 at 15) In May 2008, a U. S. Army \ncolonel wrote that Applicant\u2019s services with the Task Force \u201cled to the mission success \nof the 3d Infantry Division\u2019s mission and strong relationships between the Soldiers, the \nIraqi citizens, and leaders.\u201d (AE 1 at 10) The operations manager for Applicant\u2019s division \nwrote a strong letter of recommendation in October 2008. He stated that Applicant \"is an \nexemplary team player and displays leadership potential. Not only is he quite capable of \nhandling a high volume of work and producing quality deliverables, [Applicant] also has \nhigh moral character and is loyal.\u201d (AE 1 at 8) He submitted several certificates of \nappreciation for his service. (AE 1 at 6, 7) There is no evidence in the record that \nApplicant breached any security policies or procedures while holding a security \nclearance in Iraq.  \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride in his U.S. citizenship at the \nhearing and  his desire to resume work with the U.S. Army or obtain a position with the \nU.S. State Department. (Tr. 36)  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (HE I, V, VI) \n \nI also take administrative notice of the fact that the northern area of Iraq, \noccupied by the Kurdish people, has had a functioning democratic form of government \nfor approximately ten years. It is more stable, appreciative of the support of the United \nStates, and more friendly to the presence of the United States forces than other parts of \nIraq. (HE I, III) \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern, two of \nwhich may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nIn this case, Applicant has contact with his parents, four siblings, and in-laws, \nwho are residents and citizens of Iraq. He has sufficient familial connection to them that \nhe has filed immigration petitions to help four of them immigrate to the United States. \nHis relationship and contact with these family members potentially create a heightened \nrisk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists in the Middle East \nseek intelligence and are hostile to U. S. interests.  \n  \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nmitigation. Three Foreign Influence mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to the disqualifying conditions based on the facts: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and father-in-law are retired and receive pensions from the \nIraqi government. One of his brothers works for a public school and a brother-in-law is a \npoliceman. These facts could place them in positions in which they want to acquire \nprotected information and place Applicant in a position of having to choose between \nthem and U.S. interests. However, because those family members reside in the Kurdish \narea of Iraq, known to be more democratic and less hostile to the United States, the \npotential for a conflict of interest arising is somewhat diminished. AG \u00b6 8(a) has limited \napplication.  \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. He and his immediate family members have lived in the \nUnited States since April 1997. One of his children was born in the United States, and \none of his brothers is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing here. He owns property and \nholds bank accounts in the United States. He worked for a major university for ten years \nbefore starting a job with a federal contractor. His wife earned an advanced degree from \na U.S. university and has a position with the university. In contrast, his Iraqi interests \nhave become minimal over the years. He does not own property in Iraq. There is no \nevidence that he has connections or contact with any people other than his family \nmembers, some of whom hope to immigrate to the United States soon. He expressed a \nstrong sense of loyalty to the United States.  \n \nApplicant maintains ongoing communication with his family in Iraq. Hence, AG \u00b6 \n8(c) cannot apply, as those contacts are frequent and not casual.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The Appeal Board \nrequires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal \nloyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his \n[or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, \n2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although this case pertains to \nGuideline B, and security concerns do not arise from any questionable conduct by \nApplicant, several circumstances warrant further analysis. First, there is a significant risk \nof terrorism and various human rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security \npurposes, terrorists are hostile to the United States and actively seek classified \ninformation. Terrorists, and even friendly governments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s \nparents, siblings and in-laws to obtain such information. Second, he had numerous \nconnections to Iraq before he immigrated to the United States in 1997. Following his \nbirth, he spent his formative years there. He was educated at an Iraqi university. He \nreturned to visit his family in 2001 and 2005. Third, his parents, four siblings, and in-\nlaws remain residents and citizens of Iraq. Fourth, he has consistent contact with these \nfamily members. \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 12 years, and \nhas been a naturalized citizen for five years. His spouse has been living in the United \nStates since 1997 and is a naturalized citizen, as are two of his Iraqi-born children. One \nof his children was born here. Out of his sense of patriotism and love for the United \nStates, he joined a company providing direct support to the U.S. Army, as a cultural \nadvisor. One of his brothers, residing in Iraq, has worked for the U.S. Army. He has filed \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nimmigration petitions for four family members. All of his family members residing in Iraq \nlive in the Kurdish area, known to be more sympathetic to the United States. His ties to \nthe United States, which he refers to as having given him \u201cnew life,\u201d are much stronger \nthan his ties to his family members living in northern Iraq. There is no evidence that he \nhas ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the United States. He \ntakes his loyalty to the United States seriously, and he has worked diligently for a \ndefense contractor for several years in an important capacity for the U.S. Army. In fact, \nhe jeopardized his physical safety while working in Iraq. His supervisors assess him as \nloyal, trustworthy, conscientious, and responsible, giving him excellent evaluations and \npraising his dedication to the cause of freedom in Iraq. He is an excellent family \nmember, employee and U.S. citizen. When he returned to Iraq in 2005 with the U.S. \nArmy, he did not have any physical contact with his family, as mandated by his \nemployer. No witnesses recommended denial of his security clearance. There is not any \nderogatory information about him in the record.  \n \nApplicant held an interim security clearance during his tenure with the U.S. Army \nwithout any indication that he breached security policies or procedures. While that fact \nis not normally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board \nnoted in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006), citing ISCR Case No. 04-\n12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006) as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006). \nThe presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s \nassertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report a \nforeign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.2 Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \n                                            \n2 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. \nAssuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under \nAG \u00b68 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing \nalone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign \ninfluence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 21, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 13, 2011, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant  appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 27  years old and he\nhas a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree.  He has never been married and has no children.  In\n2003, when he was 19 years old and in college, Applicant and his father decided to enter the real\nestate business.  His father is an attorney.  Their plan was to buy \u201cintercity\u201d houses, renovate the\nproperties, and then quickly sell or \u201cflip\u201d the properties.  Between 2003 and 2005, Applicant bought\nnine houses in his individual name, all financed through first and second mortgages.  His father also\nbought a number of properties.  Applicant and his father had a joint line of credit that they used to\nfund the renovation of the properties.  Applicant quickly learned that he was unable to sell the\nproperties at a profit, so he started renting the properties.  He had problems with the properties and\nthe renters, and he was unable to maintain the mortgage payments.  He stopped paying the\nmortgages in about 2007.  Attempts to \u201cshort sale\u201d the properties were unsuccessful.  His nine\nproperties were all foreclosed upon.  His father experienced similar problems with his properties.\nHis father filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and his debts were discharged the same year.  \nWhen applying for his security clearance in October 2007, Applicant indicated that he\nplanned to address his debts through bankruptcy.  He submitted a security clearance application in\nJanuary 2008 and stated that he would be filing for bankruptcy within a month.  Applicant was\nvariously interviewed or provided answers to interrogatories during his background investigation\nin April 2008, October 2008, February 2009,  June 2009, and October 2009.  On each occasion,\nApplicant indicated his intention to file for bankruptcy, but gave numerous reasons for why he could\nnot file immediately.  These reasons generally involved advice from his attorneys to forestall filing\nuntil he filed tax returns and got information from the IRS.  In October 2009, Applicant indicated\nthat, based on his 2008 tax refunds, he once again found himself with \u201ctoo much money to file [for\nbankruptcy].\u201d  He anticipated filing for bankruptcy in January 2010, or shortly thereafter.  Applicant\nresponded to the last set of DOHA interrogatories in July 2010.  At that time he wrote that he had\nnot yet filed for bankruptcy because he realized he might not owe any taxes on the mortgage debts\nforgiven by the mortgage holders.  In addition to the outstanding mortgages, Applicant admits to\nowing $81,000 to the line of credit established by him and his father.  He also admitted owing about\n$3,000 to a credit card company.  He stated that his attorney advised him to stop making payments\non the credit card, as the card balance would be included in his bankruptcy.  As of the hearing date,\nApplicant had not filed for bankruptcy nor paid any of his delinquent debts.   \nApplicant indicated post-hearing that he has decided not to file for bankruptcy and that he\nwould pay his delinquent debts.  He is solely liable for the $82,254 line of credit, but claims that the\ndebt is \u201cclosed\u201d because the bank issued a 1099-C cancelling the debt in 2010.  No copy of the\n1099-C was submitted by Applicant.  Applicant stated that he established a payment plan on a\n$2,940 mortgage delinquency, and made his first payment of $122 in June 2011.  Applicant settled\nthe $2,604 credit card debt for $651 in May 2011.  Two delinquent mortgage accounts were\ncancelled via 1099-Cs in 2008.  A third delinquent mortgage in excess of $13,000 remains\noutstanding, although the financial institution is prepared to settle the debt for $8,000.  Applicant\nhas not made any payments toward this debt because the financial institution is demanding a lump\nsum payment.  Applicant is saving and hopes to pay this off in a few more months.  Applicant paid\n\na $519 delinquent utility debt in June 2011.  Applicant is convinced that he has taken the correct\nsteps to address his financial problems.  Applicant\u2019s performance evaluations reflect superior job\nperformance and show that Applicant is a valued and trusted employee.    \nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: The events surrounding the downturn in the\nreal estate market were outside Applicant\u2019s control.  His decision to invest in the real estate market\nwas completely within his control.  Mitigation required that individuals act responsibly under the\ncircumstances.  In 2007, Applicant stated he planned to file for bankruptcy.  Applicant took actions\nto ensure that he would be in the best possible economic position once he filed for bankruptcy.  He\nstopped paying debts that were unrelated to his mortgages, he maximized his retirement accounts,\nand he accelerated his student loan and car payments.  He did not file for bankruptcy and paid none\nof the debts by his hearing date.  Applicant did not act reasonably under the circumstances.  Post-\nhearing, Applicant paid a total of about $1,292 to pay one debt, settled another debt, and made the\nfirst payment on a third debt.  He has about $125,000 in retirement accounts and about $12,000 in\nthe bank.  His payments are insufficient to constitute a good-faith effort to pay his debts.  Applicant\nreceived 1099-Cs on several of his debts.  A creditor\u2019s cancellation of a debt does not equate to a\ngood-faith effort on Applicant\u2019s part to pay or otherwise resolve his debts.  What is missing is a\ntrack record of financial responsibility, in other words, sufficient actions to implement his repayment\nplan.  Applicant\u2019s finances are not yet under control.  His financial issues are recent and ongoing.\nThey continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.  Financial\nconcerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation.\nApplicant asserts that the logic the Judge used was unsound and that he disregarded and\nmisused certain facts in the case.  He states that he is not irresponsible, and, in any event,\nirresponsibility does not equate to unreliability.  Applicant argues that the Judge could not logically\narrive at the conclusion that he cannot protect classified information.  Applicant states that his\nactions regarding his debts have been the result of careful planning, albeit while motivated by self-\ninterest.  He argues that it was improper for the Judge to hold these matters against him.  Applicant\nstates that the Judge did not give due consideration to the efforts he has made regarding his finances\nand does not appreciate how far Applicant has come in improving his debt profile.  Applicant asserts\nthat he will make good his promise to repay his debts.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not establish error\non the part of the Judge.  \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he specifically\nstates otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009).\nNotwithstanding his assertion that the Judge disregarded certain facts, Applicant has not overcome\nthis presumption.   \nMost of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief essentially argues for an alternative view of the record\nevidence.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions\nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at\n3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \n\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed in some detail the applicability of the mitigating factors listed\nunder Guidelines F and indicated why the mitigating conditions did not apply, or if partially\napplicable, did not apply in sufficient strength to justify an ultimate favorable outcome.  These\nconclusions were reasonable given the Judge\u2019s findings about the nature of Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness, the circumstances under which it arose, Applicant\u2019s failure to file for bankruptcy after\nnumerous representations that he would, the failure of Applicant to address meaningfully his debt\ndelinquencies despite his knowledge since 2007 that his finances were of concern to the Department\nof Defense, and Applicant\u2019s failure to resolve debts because of a desire to preserve certain assets for\nthe future, despite the monetary resources he had at his disposal.\nApplicant states that the Judge concluded that two of the disqualifying conditions under\nGuideline F were potentially applicable to the case.  Applicant asserts that the Judge then\nerroneously proceeded to rule against him under two additional disqualifying conditions in his\n\u201cformal findings\u201d section.  Applicant has confused the letter designation of the individual allegations\nin the SOR with the letter designation of the various disqualifying conditions listed under Guideline\nF in the Directive.  The formal findings at the end of the Judge\u2019s decision refer to the SOR\nallegations and not the disqualifying conditions applicable to the case under Guideline F.  The Judge\ndid not commit error.   \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

These reasons generally involved advice from his attorneys to forestall filing until he filed tax returns and got information from the IRS. In October 2009, Applicant indicated that, based on his 2008 tax refunds, he once again found himself with \u201ctoo much money to file [for bankruptcy].\u201d He anticipated filing for bankruptcy in January 2010, or shortly thereafter. Applicant responded to the last set of DOHA interrogatories in July 2010. At that time he wrote that he had not yet filed for bankruptcy because he realized he might not owe any taxes on the mortgage debts forgiven by the mortgage holders. In addition to the outstanding mortgages, Applicant admits to owing $81,000 to the line of credit established by him and his father. He also admitted owing about $3,000 to a credit card company. He stated that his attorney advised him to stop making payments on the credit card, as the card balance would be included in his bankruptcy. As of the hearing date, Applicant had not filed for bankruptcy nor paid any of his delinquent debts. Applicant indicated post-hearing that he has decided not to file for bankruptcy and that he would pay his delinquent debts. He is solely liable for the $82,254 line of credit",

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 21, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 15, 2011, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 18, 2011. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 4, 2011, scheduling the hearing for May 5, \n2011. On April 28, 2011, Department Counsel contacted me, indicating that Applicant \nJuly 13, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \nmay want a continuance. Applicant, Department Counsel, and I had a telephone \nconference the same day. Applicant stated that he would like additional time to work on \nhis finances. I indicated that I would not grant a continuance over the phone, but I would \ngive him at least 45 days after the hearing to submit additional documentary evidence. I \nindicated that he could renew his request for a continuance at his hearing. The hearing \nconvened on May 5, 2011. Applicant did not seek a continuance, and he indicated that \nwith the additional 45 days to present evidence, he was prepared to proceed.  \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 12, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through L, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record was held open until July 5, 2011, for \nApplicant to submit additional information. On June 27, 2011, Applicant requested that \nthe record remain open until the end of July 2011. That request was denied. The e-mail \ncorrespondence regarding Applicant\u2019s request for additional time is marked Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. Applicant timely submitted documents that were marked AE M through Y \nand admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 18, \n2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He seeks to retain a \nsecurity clearance he has held since 2006. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s \ndegree. He has never been married and has no children.1 \n \n \n \nIn 2003, when he was 19 years old and in college, Applicant and his father \ndecided to enter the real estate business. His father is an attorney. Their plan was to \nbuy \u201cintercity\u201d houses in their individual names, renovate the properties together, and \nthen quickly sell or \u201cflip\u201d the properties. Between 2003 and 2005, Applicant bought nine \nhouses, all financed through first and second mortgages. His father also bought a \nnumber of properties. Applicant and his father had a joint line of credit that they used to \nfund the renovation of the properties. Applicant quickly learned that he was unable to \nsell the properties at a profit, and he started renting the properties. He had problems \nwith the properties and his renters, and he was unable to maintain the mortgage \npayments. He stopped paying the mortgages in about 2007. Further attempts to sell or \n\u201cshort sale\u201d the properties were unsuccessful. His nine properties were all foreclosed \nupon. His father experienced similar problems with his properties. His father filed \nbankruptcy in 2008, and his debts were discharged the same year.2 \n \n \nApplicant wrote a statement for his security clearance in October 2007. He \nexplained his foreclosures and wrote that he planned to address his debts through \nbankruptcy. He submitted a questionnaire for national security positions (SF 86) in \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 21, 25, 117, 159; GE 1; AE B, N. \n \n2 Tr. at 27-46, 54-56, 115, 128-130; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5, 7, 8; AE D, E, H. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nJanuary 2008. He listed the foreclosure of his properties and his delinquent debts. He \nwrote that he would \u201cbe filing for bankruptcy within the month.\u201d3 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in April 2008. He told \nthe investigator that he had not filed bankruptcy because his attorney advised him to \nwait until he had filed his tax return for tax year 2005. He stated that he planned to file \nbankruptcy in May 2008. In addition to his mortgages, he admitted that he owed \n$81,000 to his and his father\u2019s line of credit (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$82,254) and about $3,000 to a \ncredit card company (SOR \u00b6 1.c-$2,604). He told the investigator that his attorney \nadvised him to stop making purchases with the card and to stop making payments on \nthe card, as the card balance would be included in his bankruptcy.4  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed again in October 2008. He stated that he had to file his \nstate and federal tax returns for 2005 before he could file bankruptcy. He stated that he \nplanned to file bankruptcy in December 2008.5   \n \n \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in February 2009. He stated that \nhe had not yet filed bankruptcy because he was waiting for information from the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) regarding IRS forms 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt). He \nresponded to additional DOHA interrogatories in June 2009. He stated that he received \nhis 1099-Cs from the IRS for tax year 2007, but the documents from tax year 2008 \nwould not be available until June 2009. He anticipated filing bankruptcy in July 2009.6  \n \n \nApplicant responded to another set of DOHA interrogatories in October 2009, in \nwhich he wrote: \n \nBankruptcy has yet to be filed. Upon receipt of my 2008 tax refunds, I \nonce again find myself with too much money to file \u2013 at least if I did file, I \nwould lose some of my cash. Note that since [approximate amount of \ncash] on hand is nowhere near enough to pay off my debts, I am not \nconsidering that. Bankruptcy is still in my plans. However, upon advice \nfrom my attorney, I paid off my student loans reducing my assets by \n[about] $6,500.7  \n \nApplicant wrote that his \u201cbankruptcy was postponed for 90 days to avoid having [his] \nstudent loan payoff count toward [his] assets.\u201d He anticipated filing bankruptcy in \nJanuary 2010, or shortly thereafter.8  \n                                                          \n3 GE 1, 7. \n \n4 GE 5. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 GE 4, 6. \n \n7 GE 3. \n \n8 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant responded to the last set of DOHA interrogatories in July 2010. He \nwrote that he had not yet filed bankruptcy because he realized he might not owe any \ntaxes on the mortgage debts forgiven by the mortgage holders. He wrote that he should \nknow which path he would need to take in \u201canother couple months.\u201d9  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 10, 2011, and he responded to it on \nFebruary 15, 2011. He indicated that he was still working his tax debts and 1099-C. He \nstated that he intended to hire an accountant to amend his previous tax returns to \naddress his debt forgiveness and to file his 2010 tax returns. He also stated that his \neventual plan was to hire \u201can attorney to determine the grand total of outstanding debts \nand to file bankruptcy.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant testified that his actions up through the hearing were based upon the \nadvice of his attorneys. He followed his attorneys\u2019 advice, and his actions were by \ndesign to place him in the best position financially after he declared bankruptcy. He \nmaximized the amount contributed to his 401(k) and IRA retirement accounts, as those \naccounts are not affected by bankruptcy. He stated that he had about $100,000 in his \n401(k), $25,000 in his IRA, and about $12,000 in the bank. He also paid his student \nloans because they are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, and he expedited his car loan \npayments because he is able to keep the car in a bankruptcy.10  \n \n \nAs of the hearing date, Applicant had not filed bankruptcy nor paid any of his \ndelinquent debts. He admitted that he incurred all the debts alleged in the SOR. He \nstated that banks and mortgage companies accept the risk that people will not pay their \nloan and set the interest rates accordingly. He also noted that the companies holding \nthe first mortgages received the properties back and were able to write off the \ndeficiencies, thereby earning a tax benefit. He argued that made them \u201cwhole,\u201d and \n\u201c[t]hey should be okay with that.\u201d He listed five proposals on how he could address his \nfinances, and he stated that he would take action on one of them in the near future.11  \n \n \nApplicant indicated post-hearing that he has decided not to file bankruptcy, and \nthat he would pay his delinquent debts. His father had his debts discharged in \nbankruptcy, so Applicant is solely liable for their joint $82,254 line of credit alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. That account was not secured by any properties. Applicant did not pay the \ndebt. He stated the debt is \u201cclosed\u201d because the bank issued a 1099-C, cancelling the \ndebt in 2010. He testified that it takes about a year to obtain a copy of the 1099-C from \nthe IRS, and it was not available yet. He stated the bank told him that they mailed him a \ncopy of the 1099-C in January 2011. He stated that the letter was probably in a large \nstack of unopened mail that he had not gone through. Applicant did not submit a copy of \na 1099-C for this debt in his post-hearing submission.12 \n                                                          \n9 GE 2.  \n \n10 Tr. at 60-63, 70-72, 99-103. \n \n11 Tr. at 40, 59, 65, 123, 136-154; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n12 Tr. at 54-59, 64, 152-153; AE C, N. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a delinquent $2,940 mortgage account. Applicant stated that \nhe established a payment plan with the company collecting the debt. He paid $122 on \nJune 30, 2011. He stated that was his first monthly payment, and that the \u201cdebt will be \ngone in less than one year.\u201d13 \n \n \nApplicant owed $2,604 to a credit card company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. This \ndebt is unrelated to Applicant\u2019s real estate ventures. Applicant stated that he used the \ncredit card \u201cto buy groceries, gas, entertainment, etc.\u201d The debt became delinquent in \n2007, when Applicant\u2019s attorney advised him that he should not use the card and that \nhe should not pay the debt because \u201cthe balance will be eliminated by the bankruptcy.\u201d \nApplicant settled the debt for $651 on May 24, 2011.14 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f allege delinquent mortgage accounts of $70,350, \n$62,902, and $13,341 owed to the same financial institution. The financial institution \nissued 1099-Cs in 2008 cancelling the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. Applicant \nstated the financial institution is willing to settle the $13,341 debt for a lump-sum \npayment of $8,000, but it is unwilling to accept installment payments. Applicant stated \nthat he was \u201cuncomfortable taking money from [his] retirement account or borrowing \nmoney with a credit card to pay debts. So [he] is saving for a few more months, and \nthen [he] will pay this off.\u201d15 \n \n \nIn June 2011, Applicant paid the $519 delinquent utility debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.g. This debt was from one of Applicant\u2019s rental properties.16 \n \n \nApplicant is convinced that he has taken the correct steps to address his financial \nproblems. He does not live a lavish lifestyle, and he is committed to saving for his \nretirement.17  \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations reflect superior job performance and show \nthat Applicant is a valued and trusted employee. He has received a number of awards \nand accolades for his work. Letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf attest to his responsibility, \nindependence, ethics, leadership, trustworthiness, work ethic, honesty, loyalty, \npatriotism, dedication, and integrity. The authors are aware of Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and recommend him for a security clearance.18 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n13 AE N, Q. \n \n14 Tr. at 158; GE 1; AE N, Q. \n \n15 Tr. at 78-85; AE C, N. \n \n16 Tr. at 85-88, 158-159; AE N, P. \n \n17 Tr. at 104, 109; AE N. \n \n18 AE H, I, O, R-X. \n\n \n6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay \nsome of his financial obligations and unwilling to pay others. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhile a college student, Applicant invested heavily in the real estate market, \npurchasing nine properties. He quickly realized that he was unable to flip the properties, \nand he decided to rent them. He attributed his financial problems to the downturn in the \nreal estate market and tenants who did not pay the rent. Those events were outside \nApplicant\u2019s control. His decision to invest in the real estate market was completely \nwithin his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. All nine properties were foreclosed upon. In 2007, Applicant stated that \nhe planned to file bankruptcy. Following legal advice, Applicant took actions to ensure \nthat he would be in the best possible economic position once he filed bankruptcy. To \nthat end, he stopped paying debts that were unrelated to his mortgages; he maximized \nhis retirement accounts; and he accelerated his student loans and car payments. He did \nnot file bankruptcy and paid none of the debts by his hearing date. I find that Applicant \ndid not act responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant stated that he planned to address his debts through \nbankruptcy. In January 2008, he wrote that he would \u201cbe filing for bankruptcy within the \nmonth.\u201d In April 2008, he stated he planned to file bankruptcy in May 2008. In October \n2008, he stated that he had to file his state and federal tax returns for 2005 before he \ncould file bankruptcy, and that he planned to file bankruptcy in December 2008. In \nFebruary 2009, he stated that he was waiting for information from the IRS and that he \nanticipated filing bankruptcy in July 2009. In October 2009, he wrote that he had \u201ctoo \nmuch money to file \u2013 at least if [he] did file, [he] would lose some of [his] cash.\u201d He \nanticipated filing bankruptcy in January 2010, or shortly thereafter. In July 2010, he \nwrote that he had not yet filed bankruptcy because he realized he might not owe any \ntaxes on the mortgage debts forgiven by the mortgage holders, and he should know \nwhich path he would need to take in \u201canother couple months.\u201d In February 2011, he \nindicated that he was still working his tax debts and 1099-C. He stated that his eventual \nplan was to hire \u201can attorney to determine the grand total of outstanding debts and to \nfile bankruptcy.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant had taken no action by his hearing date, but he stated that he planned \nto take one of five options. He testified that he had about $125,000 in retirement \naccounts and about $12,000 in the bank. He indicated post-hearing that he has decided \nnot to file bankruptcy, and that he would pay his delinquent debts. He paid a total of \nabout $1,292 to pay one debt, settle another debt, and make the first payment on a third \ndebt. I find those payments are insufficient to constitute a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts.19 Applicant received 1099-Cs on several of his debts. A creditor\u2019s cancellation of \n                                                          \n19 The Appeal Board addressed debt settlement in ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010): \n \nApplicant\u2019s attempts to settle outstanding debts at a reduced amount speaks directly to \nan evaluation of the good faith nature of Applicant\u2019s effort to reduce indebtedness \nresponsibly, given the record evidence of the fact that she had funds available to fully \nsatisfy these debts, and the fact that Applicant\u2019s attempts to settle the debts for a lesser \namount resulted in their going unpaid. \n \n\n \n9 \n \na debt does not equate to a good-faith effort on Applicant\u2019s part to pay or otherwise \nresolve his debts.20 AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant received legal advice on how to handle his debts. The first part of AG \u00b6 \n20(c) is applicable. He paid or settled the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g. The \nsecond part of AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable to those debts. It also has some applicability to \nthe debts that have been cancelled.  \n \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nWhat is missing here is a track record of financial responsibility, in other words, \nsignificant actions to implement his plan. I find that Applicant\u2019s finances are not yet \nunder control. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. I am unable to determine \nthat they are unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. I find that financial \nconcerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n                                                          \n20 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [good-faith mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n \n10 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. He has known since 2007 \nthat his finances have been a concern to the Department of Defense. As of the hearing \ndate, he had paid nothing toward his delinquent debts. He paid a total of about $1,292 \nafter the hearing. Applicant\u2019s failure to act responsibly toward his legal obligations, \nparticularly those that were not secured by properties, raises significant unresolved \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file,  pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\n \nStatement of Case\nOn April 28, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant first responded to the SOR on May 28, 2010. He filed a second answer\non June 28, 2010, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written\nDecember 30, 2010\n\n2\nrecord. Applicant received the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 21, 2010, and\nprovided additional written information within the 30 days permitted. The case was\nassigned to me on September 3, 2010.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accrued two outstanding\njudgments, one in the amount of $1,078 (covered by subparagraph 1.a), and another in\nthe amount of $5,123 (covered by subparagraph 1.l and (b) accumulated 13 delinquent\ndebts (either charged off or in collection) between 2006 and 2009, exceeding $31,000\nas follows: creditor 1.b ($1,445); creditor 1.c ($457; creditor 1.d ($5,474); creditor 1.e\n($1,198); creditor 1.f ($1,130); creditor 1.g ($1,454); creditor 1.h ($12.299); creditor 1.i\n($5,631); creditor 1.j ($1,430); creditor 1.k ($917); creditor 1.l ($5,123); creditor 1.m\n($84); and creditor 1.n ($149). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of\nthe debts; he denied only  the debt covered by subparagraph 1.a. He furnished no\nexplanations. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29-year-old system administrator for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married in December 2003. (Item 6) He has no children from this\nmarriage. He separated from his wife (W1) in 2006. She initiated divorce proceedings\nagainst him in December 2006. (Items 7 and 8) \nApplicant enlisted in the Navy in September 2000 and received his discharge in\nSeptember 2005. (Item 6) Between January 2007 and July 2007, applicant was\nunemployed and had no reported income.  Without any income sources, he was unable\nto pay any of listed credit card accounts, and they became delinquent. Records show\nthat between 2006 and 2009 Applicant accumulated two outstanding judgments, one in\nthe amount of $1,078 (covered by subparagraph 1.a), and another in the amount of\n$5,123 (covered by subparagraph 1.l and (b) accumulated 13 delinquent debts (either\ncharged off or in collection). The largest debt listed in the SOR involved a medical\naccount with a reported outstanding balance of $12,299. (see Item 7) Applicant\u2019s state\ntaxes were garnished to cover the debt, but Applicant does not know whether any of the\ndebt was ever credited.  \nIn March 2007, Applicant purchased a pickup truck for $33,557. (Item 8) After\ncrediting Applicant with the proceeds from the repossession sale, this creditor claims a\ndeficiency balance in the amount of $9,719. (Item 13) While this debt is not listed in the\nSOR, it remains an unpaid balance and is listed as an unsecured priority debt in\nAppellant\u2019s recently filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \nSince returning to full-time employment in July 2007, Applicant has made no\ntangible efforts to contact any of his creditors to work out repayment arrangements.  His\ndebts remain unsatisfied.\n\n3\nUnable to address his delinquent debts individually, Applicant petitioned for\nChapter 13 relief in July 2010. (Items 12 and 13)  In this petition, Applicant scheduled\nunsecured, non-priority claims totaling $44,602. (Item 13) In the same petition, he listed\nnet monthly income of $2,788 for himself and $2,932 for his wife (W2). He agreed to\nlegal fees for counseling and filing the petition of $1,252. (Item 13) \nApplicant\u2019s post-FORM submissions do not indicate any plan approval from the\npresiding court. In his undated cover letter (Item 12), he assured he has set up a\nbudget and received debt counseling. However, he provided no documentation to\nsupport his claims. Without more documentation of progress in his Chapter 13 plan\nproposal, no inferences can be drawn about the probability of his completing his\nproposed plan.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made\nabout whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n\n4\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n\n5\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a system administrator of a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts (to include two adverse judgments) during a six-month\nperiod of unemployment. His accumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability\nand unwillingness to address these debts warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s pleading admissions of the debts covered in the SOR negate the\nneed for any independent proof (see McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006)).\nEach of Applicant\u2019s listed debts are fully documented in his latest credit reports and\nprovide ample corroboration of his debts.\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his extended period of\nunemployment in 2007. His largest debt is a deficiency resulting from a car\nrepossession.  After crediting Applicant with the proceeds of sale, the creditor claims\na deficiency of $12,299.  Besides this large debt, Applicant remains obligated on two\noutstanding judgments and a host of smaller debt delinquencies that were either\ncharged off or are in collection status.  Each of these debts remain unresolved and\nare covered in Applicant\u2019s recently filed Chapter 13 petition. \nBased on the documented materials in the FORM, some extenuating\ncircumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s inability to pay or otherwise resolve his\ndebts. Available to Applicant is MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly.\u201d\nMoreover, some judgment problems persist, too, over Applicant\u2019s accumulated\ndebts and his failure to demonstrate he acted responsibly in addressing his listed\ndebts once he returned to full-time employment in August 2007 and the conditions\nthat contributed to the delinquencies had passed or eased. See ISCR Case 03-01059\nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004).  Not only are his listed debt delinquencies ongoing, but\nhe failed to address them in any tangible way before petitioning for Chapter 13 relief\nin July 2010. Mitigation credit is only partially available to Applicant based on the\nevidence developed in this record.         \n                                          \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on Government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\nGovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). \nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts. Since his return to\n\n6\nwork in August 2007, he has not shown sufficient effort in addressing any of his\ncovered debts to mitigate his still delinquent accounts.  Resolution of his delinquent\naccounts is a critical prerequisite to his regaining control of his  finances. While\nunemployment conditions might have played a considerable role in his accumulation\nof so many debts over a relatively short period, Applicant failed to provide any\nexplanatory reasons why he failed to address his debts before July 2010.\nEndorsements and performance evaluations might have been helpful, too, in making\na whole-person assessment of his overall clearance eligibility, but were not provided.\nOverall, clearance eligibility assessment of Applicant based on the limited amount of\ninformation available for consideration in this record does not enable him to establish\njudgment and trust levels sufficient to overcome security concerns arising out of his\naccumulation of delinquent debts.\nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, his lack of any payment track record, and his failure\nto provide proof of any approval of his recent Chapter 13 petition, it is still soon to\nmake safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and\nrestore his finances to stable levels commensurate with the minimum requirements for\nholding a security clearance.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.n.  \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the 2(a) factors enumerated in the AGs.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubparas. 1.a through 1.n:\n    Against Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 23, 2009; answered it on August 28, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nJanuary 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on August 31, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September \n21, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on September 28, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on October 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for October 28, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but presented no \ndocumentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 4, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old account executive for a defense contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since November 2007. He was married in July 2004. \nHe has a 4-year-old son and a son born two weeks before the hearing (Tr. 30). He has \nnever held a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol at age 15 (GX 2 at 6). He was arrested for \npossession of marijuana at age 17, while he was in high school. He continued to use \nalcohol and marijuana through high school and college. Between 1987 and 1993, while \nhe was in college, he used marijuana three to four days a week (Tr. 33). He used \nlysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms ten to fifteen \ntimes, cocaine five or six times (GX 2 at 8-9), and nitrous oxide twice (GX 4 at 26; Tr. \n34-35). After graduating from college, he continued to purchase and use marijuana \nthree or four times a week until June 2000 (Tr. 37) \n \nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in 1988 and 1991 \n(GX 5 at 1-2). In March 2000, while he was pursuing a master\u2019s degree, he sought \ntreatment because he was concerned about his pattern of heavy drinking. He was \narrested for his third DUI in June 2000 (GX 5 at 3; Tr. 27). His doctor, a psychiatrist \nspecializing in addiction treatment (Tr. 39), prescribed medications for anxiety (GX 2 at \n5), and recommended that Applicant enter a residential alcohol and drug rehabilitation \ncenter (Tr. 39-40).  \n \nApplicant voluntarily entered a residential alcohol and drug rehabilitation center in \nJune 2000. At the time, he was consuming 16 to 24 beers and smoking one or two \nmarijuana cigarettes daily (GX 4 at 6). He was evaluated by a social worker and a \nmedical doctor (GX 4 at 9), and he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and \ncannabis dependence. He dropped out of graduate school in order to complete the \nrehabilitation program (Tr. 28). He completed the program in November 2000 and \nreceived a good prognosis, contingent on complying with the aftercare plan, which \nincluded regular attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings (GX 4 at 4). He \ncompleted his graduate studies and received a master\u2019s degree in information \ntechnology in August 2001 (GX 1 at 6; Tr. 28-29). He continued to see his psychiatrist \ntwice a week until January 2002, when he moved to another state (Tr. 42). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant stopped consuming alcohol and using marijuana when he entered the \nrehabilitation program in June 2000. He attended AA meetings regularly until around \n2005 (GX 2 at 8). He and his wife, also a recovering alcoholic, now attend AA meetings \nless frequently, but they have a core group of friends in recovery and they support each \nother (GX 3 at 8; Tr. 29). Applicant currently is a sponsor for another AA member (Tr. \n43). He regularly reads the \u201cBig Book\u201d published by AA (Tr. 51).  \n \n \n \nApplicant resumed his marijuana use in November 2005. He is an avid mountain \nbiker, and he purchased and used small amounts of marijuana while mountain biking \nwith friends. He stopped using marijuana in December 2007, when he learned his \nemployer wanted him to obtain a security clearance (GX 2 at 8). He estimated he used \nmarijuana 35 to 40 times between November 2005 and December 2007 (Tr. 29).  \n \nApplicant testified that his wife expressed concerns about his marijuana use. In \nDecember 2007, he realized his marijuana use \u201cwasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d He was concerned \nabout the impact of his marijuana use on his family, and he knew his marijuana use was \ngoing in a direction that could get worse (Tr. 49). He continues to see the mountain \nbikers with whom he used marijuana, but he no longer rides with them (Tr. 48). He \ntestified that marijuana use is not a part of his life and it will never be a part of his life \nagain (Tr. 30). \n \nApplicant disclosed his DUI convictions, treatment for alcoholism, and drug use \non his security clearance application (GX 1 at 22-27, 29). During an interview with a \nsecurity investigator in April 2008, Applicant told the investigator that he enjoyed using \nmarijuana, and that it helped him to relieve stress. He also told the investigator that he \nis not ashamed of his illegal drug use, but he believes that it is not socially acceptable \n(GX 2 at 9).  \n \nApplicant is not currently receiving any counseling for anxiety, but he continues \nto take anxiety medications that are prescribed and monitored by his physician (GX 2 at \n9). He visits with his physician, a general practitioner, every six months (Tr. 54). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \n\n \n4 \n \n \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana from 1987 to June 2000 and from \nNovember 2005 to December 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he purchased marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b), \nhe used LSD, ecstasy, cocaine, and mushrooms between 1988 and 1993 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-\n1.f); he used nitrous oxide in 1992-1993 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and he was arrested and charged \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwith possession of marijuana in 1987 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). It also alleges he was treated from \nJune to November 2000 for cannabis dependence (SOR \u00b6 1.i). \n \n \nThe SOR does not allege any disqualifying conditions under Guideline J (Alcohol \nConsumption). I have considered the evidence of Applicant\u2019s alcohol dependence and \nalcohol abuse for the limited purposes of assessing his credibility; deciding which \nadjudicative guidelines are applicable; evaluating the evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, and changed circumstances; considering whether he has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; and as part of my whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. \n03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \nThe concern under Guideline H is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse of \na prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. This guideline encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1).  \n \nThe evidence raises the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse, defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as \u201cthe illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction\u201d;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug \ndependence. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant last used marijuana in December 2007, more than two years ago. Two \nyears is \u201ca significant period of time\u201d within the meaning of this mitigating condition. \nSeveral factors tend to negate application of this mitigating condition. Applicant \npreviously abstained from marijuana use for more than five years and then relapsed in \nNovember 2005, which tends to show that a two-year period of abstinence is not \nsufficient to demonstrate rehabilitation. His decision to stop using marijuana was \nmotivated in part by his desire to obtain a security clearance, and not because of any \nlegal, moral, or ethical considerations.  \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s decision to stop using marijuana in December \n2007 was also motivated by his wife\u2019s disapproval, his increased family responsibilities, \nconcern about the impact of his marijuana use on his family, and his realization that he \nwas going down a path of substance abuse similar to what he previously experienced. \nHe is more mature, self-aware, and committed to his professional career than he was in \nDecember 2007. He has twice experienced the downward slide of his lifestyle caused \nby substance abuse, and he does not desire to repeat that experience. In addition to his \ntwo-year period of abstinence from marijuana use, he has abstained from alcohol for \nmore than nine years. After weighing all the evidence, I conclude that AG \u00b6 26(a) is \nestablished.  \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). The evidence establishes AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3), but not AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), (2), or (4). \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished. Applicant satisfactorily completed an extensive and intense drug and \nalcohol rehabilitation program. It was recommended by his psychiatrist, but not \n\u201cprescribed.\u201d He complied with the aftercare requirements. He received a favorable \nprognosis in November 2000, but he has since relapsed. He has not received any drug \ntreatment or prognosis since his relapse.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He presented himself at the hearing \nas intelligent, articulate, candid, and sincere. He fully disclosed his record of substance \nabuse in his security clearance application. His disclosures in his application and during \nsubsequent security interviews and DOHA interrogatories are the only evidence \nsupporting the allegations in the SOR. His candor and sincerity during the security \nclearance process are strong indicators that he is trustworthy and reliable.  \n \n \nApplicant has suffered from anxiety for many years, and his substance abuse \nwas due in large part to his efforts to self-medicate his anxiety. He has learned to \ncontrol his anxiety through prescribed medication and counseling.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person and my obligation to \ndecide doubtful cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns based on drug involvement. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn January 3, 2008, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF \n86)(e-QIP). On June 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 17, 2009. She answered the \nSOR in writing on June 22, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 26, 2009, and I \nreceived the case assignment on August 28, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \non September 1, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 15, \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through N into evidence, \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 24, \n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 22, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6 1.d of the SOR. She also provided additional information to support her \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, has one child, and worked for a defense contractor until \nshe was laid off in June 2009 because she did not have a security clearance. She now \nlives with her father to save money while she collects unemployment. She pays her \nfather $300 monthly for expenses. She will be reemployed by the same company if she \nobtains a security clearance. Applicant worked for 18 months at that company, which \npaid her $20,000 more than her previous employment in a bank. (Tr. 24, 25, 30, 47, 48; \nExhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant has four delinquent debts listed on the SOR. These debts total \n$19,979. These debts remain after Applicant\u2019s efforts to repay other debts. At the \npresent time, Applicant has three credit cards with balances on them that are not listed \nin the SOR. She is paying the minimum monthly payments on them to keep them \ncurrent.

(Tr. 32, 52-69, 76) \n \n \nApplicant reduced her expenses after her June 2009 layoff, and lives on the \nunemployment compensation she receives. She used her savings account of $2,500 to \npay some debts, and has $1,500 remaining in the account. When employed, she saved \n$200 a month.  Her car is paid and she watches her expenditures carefully. (Tr. 47-65) \n \n \nApplicant owes $10,360 (SOR Para. 1.a.) on a credit card she obtained while \nattending college. She graduated from college in 2005. She used it for purchases of \nfood, books, and other necessities for which her scholarship did not pay. The creditor \ntold Applicant recently that with the 29% interest rate on the card the amount owed is \nnow $21,642.75. Applicant pays the creditor $100 monthly on the account. She has \nmade two payments, in August and September 2009.  She will make a third payment in \nOctober 2009. After establishing a regular payment pattern, the creditor will negotiate \nwith her on a settlement amount. This debt is currently being resolved by an installment \npayment plan. (Tr. 31-36; Exhibits 2-6, A, E-K)) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant also owes $3,951 on another credit card (SOR Para. 1.b). She pays \n$50 monthly on that account. She has made three payments on this debt, in June, July, \nand August 2009.  She continues to pay on this account. This debt is being resolved by \nan installment payment plan. (Tr. 36-38; Exhibits 2-6, B, E-K) \n \n \nApplicant owes $5,430 on another store credit card (SOR Para. 1.c).  She pays \nthis creditor $100 monthly on this debt. Applicant made three payments on this account, \nin June, July, and August 2009. This debt is being resolved by an installment payment \nplan. (Tr. 40-42; Exhibits 2-6, C, E-K) \n \n \nThe delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d is for $238 owed to a creditor on a judgment.  \nApplicant denied that this debt was owed by her. She submitted a letter from the \ncreditor dated June 19, 2009, stating that the judgment debtor was Applicant\u2019s father, \nnot Applicant. Applicant has never owed this debt. SOR \u00b6 1.d. is found for the Applicant. \n(Tr. 44; Exhibits 2-6, D-K) \n \n \nApplicant paid four debts in 2009.  Those debts were owed to a clothing store, a \nphysician, a cell telephone service provider, and on her 1998 automobile. (Tr. 39, 70, \n76; Exhibits F-K) \n \n \nApplicant submitted two character letters. One letter came from her supervisor, \nwho described Applicant as \u201cdependable, honest, courteous, hard working and very \nintelligent.\u201d Her supervisor also regarded Applicant as an \u201cexcellent employee.\u201d The \ndirector of a cultural center where Applicant formerly worked also praised her \ndependability and excellent work ethic. Applicant\u2019s employee evaluation for the period of \nJanuary 28, 2008, through June 30, 2008, showed that she met or exceeded \nexpectations. (Exhibits L to N) \n \n \nApplicant made a well-organized presentation of documents showing the current \nstatus of her repayment plan for her remaining three delinquent debts.  She is a credible \nperson. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline lists nine conditions that could raise security concerns. From these \nnine conditions, two are applicable in this case. \n \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt when using credit \ncards while attending college. Her spending exceeded her financial ability to repay the \ndebts in a regular process. These debts started accruing at least four years ago and she \ndid not begin resolving them until January 2009. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes six examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. After evaluating all of the evidence, I \nconclude two mitigating conditions are applicable. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial difficulties \narose about 2005. She accumulated delinquent debt due to her spending habits while a \ncollege student with no regular source of income. Since 2008, Applicant has \nconcentrated her efforts at repaying these debts listed in the SOR, while at the same \ntime resolving other delinquent debts, which are not listed. She has the three debts in \nSOR Para. 1.a to 1.c remaining on her credit record to resolve by the installment \npayment agreements. She has also reduced her expenses, and has controlled her \nexpenditures, while collecting unemployment. The college circumstances are no longer \nextant. I find the behavior occurred under unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur, and it does not raise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition.  \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant is \nresolving the three remaining delinquent debts by installment payment plans that she \nnegotiated. She is making payments even though her income is reduced and she \ncollects unemployment insurance payments.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a college student \nwhen she incurred these debts, succumbing to the lure of easy credit extended to \nstudents by various companies.  Then, she compounded her financial errors by not \ncontrolling her spending and not making regular payments to resolve the debts. She has \nonly these three SOR-listed delinquent debts remaining to pay, in addition to three \ncredit cards that she no longer uses. Her expense-reduction program, coupled with her \ninstallment repayment plan, demonstrate that Applicant is acting responsibly to resolve \nher debts, even in her reduced income situation. These are permanent behavioral \nchanges motivated by her innate sense of responsibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s character letters describe a thoughtful person of integrity. She \nimpressed her supervisors at two places of employment, who made the effort to write \nthese character letters. These letters and Applicant\u2019s presentation at the hearing show \nthat, under the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, she is not a security risk. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 32 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Systems Analyst and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR sets forth that the Applicant is indebted to at least ten different creditors that involve defaulted auto loans, credit card accounts, other consumer debts, and student loans totaling approximately $ 28,341.00. Applicant admits several of the debts and denies others, asserting that he has either satisfied the debt and/or is no longer responsible for it. (See Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM). Credit reports of the Applicant dated December 12, 2007, December 17, 2008, and December 23, 2008, reflect each of the delinquent debts as owing. (Government Exhibits 6,8 and 9).

Stevens, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 25, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on November 20, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 5).  On February 6, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 16, 2009, in which he\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on August 10, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on August 13, 2009, and he submitted a reply on September 11, 2009.  The\ncase was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on October 15, 2009.  Based upon\n\n2\na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 32 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nSystems Analyst and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe SOR sets forth that the Applicant is indebted to at least ten different creditors\nthat involve defaulted auto loans, credit card accounts, other consumer debts, and\nstudent loans totaling approximately $ 28,341.00.  Applicant admits several of the debts\nand denies others, asserting that he has either satisfied the debt and/or is no longer\nresponsible for it.  (See Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM).  Credit reports of the Applicant\ndated December 12, 2007, December 17, 2008, and December 23, 2008, reflect each\nof the delinquent debts as owing.  (Government Exhibits 6,8 and 9).  \nIn February 2005, the Applicant left active duty.  He explained that at that time,\nunbeknownst to him, having to change from USAA insurance to another company, his\nmortgage insurance increased, which caused his mortgage payment to increase from\n$1,536.00 to $1,941.00 monthly.  His car payment also increased from $650.00 monthly\nto $695.00.  This unexpected significant financial increase triggered a number of\ndelinquent debts that the Applicant was not prepared for.  Although the Applicant\ncontinued to work full time, he was not in a financial position to tackle his delinquent\ndebt.    \nIn August 2009, the Applicant became a self-employed government contractor.\nSince his most recent credit report, he has been working hard to resolve his delinquent\ndebts.  He has contacted each of the creditors, inquired into the debt, and has provided\nsupporting documentation showing that he has either paid off the debt in full, set up a\npayment plan to pay it, or has otherwise resolved the debt.   He plans to incur no new\ndebt.      \nListed in the SOR are the following debts; a debt in the amount of $12,826.00 for\na repossession and resale of a vehicle  remains owing (allegation 1(a)).  The Applicant\nhas established a payment plan with the creditor in the amount of $100.00 monthly and\nplans to continue with the payments until the debt is paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to\nthe FORM).  \n\n3\nDebts owed to creditors in the amount of $1,100.00 (allegation 1(b)) and\n$1,230.00 (allegation 1(c)), are not the Applicant\u2019s responsibility.  The Applicant has\nprovided letters from the creditors acknowledging that he was only an \u201cauthorized user\u201d\nof his wife\u2019s credit cards and has no financial responsibility for the account balance.\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to the FORM and attachments B and C).  \nIn regard to a debt owed to creditor in the amount of $1,357.00, Applicant has\ndisputed the debt, and received a letter from the creditor indicating that the debt was\nsold to another creditor and therefore said creditor has no reportable financial interest\nagainst the Applicant concerning the debt.  The letter also indicates that there is a zero\nbalance on the account with the bank that the debt had been sold to (allegation 1(d)).\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to the FORM and attachment D, and Applicant\u2019s Post Hearing\nExhibit).  \nLetters from the creditors concerning debts in the amount of $816.00 and $83.00\nindicate that the collection accounts have been closed and all adverse information has\nbeen removed from the Applicant\u2019s credit report concerning the debts. (allegations 1(e)\nand 1(f)).  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the FORM attachment E and F).\n  \nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $695.00 has been paid (allegation\n1(g)).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,880.00 has been paid (allegation\n1(h)).  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the FORM and attachments G and H).  \nApplicant denies a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $7,286.00 for a\nvehicle.  He submitted a copy of the car title and there is no lien holder shown.\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to the FORM and attachment I).  \nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,058.00 has been paid (allegation\n1(j)).  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the FORM and attachment J).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances;\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\n\n5\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant has contacted each of the creditors and either paid\noff the debt, set up a payment plan to do so, or resolved the debt.  He understands the\nimportance of paying his bills on time and living within his means.  Under the\ncircumstances, he has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is\nevidence of financial rehabilitation.  He has demonstrated that he can properly handle\nhis financial affairs and that he is fiscally responsible.  Under the particular facts of this\ncase, the Applicant must continue to pay off his debts in a timely fashion and maintain a\nclean credit report or his security clearance will again be in jeopardy.\n\n6\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control; and 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for\nthe Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, candor, and a  willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, and it mitigates the negative\neffects of his financial indebtedness and the effects that it can have on his ability to\nsafeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has\novercome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.   \n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n  \n\n7\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn June 16, 2008, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On September 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 21, 2009. She \nanswered the SOR in writing on October 1, 2009, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 9, \n2009, and I received the case assignment on November 16, 2009. DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing on December 2, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nDecember 14, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received \n \n \n \n \n1\nMarch 31, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through C, without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 28, 2009. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until January 4, 2010, to submit \nadditional matters.  On January 4, 2010, she submitted Exhibit D, without objection. The \nrecord closed on January 4, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel stated the Notice of Hearing and the hearing \ndate are less than 15 days apart. I advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the \nDirective to have 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her \nright to 15 days notice and elected to proceed with the hearing. (Tr. at 8, 9)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR, \nwith explanations. She also provided additional information to support her request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is 40, divorced and has five children. The three daughters live with her. \nOne son lives with her former husband, and the oldest son is a college student. She \nwas married to her husband from 1989 until divorcing him in 2001. She remarried him in \n2004 and divorced him in 2009. She works for a defense contractor as a material \nhandler and has done so for the past five years.  (Tr. 22-26, 35, 51; Exhibit 1) \n \nApplicant has 21 delinquent debts totaling $15,684.74 listed in the SOR. She \nfiled Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 1999, and it was discharged in May 1999. She \nagain filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2009, and it was discharged in November 2009. \nIn her latest bankruptcy, the unsecured debts total $14,221.32 on the Schedule F. Her \ndelinquent debts listed in the SOR, and in the Chapter 7 petition, include medical debts \nnot covered by her employer\u2019s health insurance plan, credit card debts, telephone \ndebts, and a utility company debt. Applicant did not pay any of the debts listed in the \nSOR. She did not demonstrate at the hearing, or by January 4, 2010, that the SOR \ndebts were all included in her latest bankruptcy. My examination of the bankruptcy \nSchedule F and the SOR showed 14 of the SOR-listed debts were included in the \nbankruptcy, based on creditor name and amount owed (SOR Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.q, 1.r, 1.t). As part of the bankruptcy, Applicant \nattended and completed a personal financial management course in September 2009, \nand received credit counseling by telephone in July 2009. (Tr. 27-29, 42-44, 58; Exhibits \n2-4, A-C) \n \nApplicant has 12 delinquent debts listed in the SOR that are under $200 each. \nThese debts total $1,212. The SOR next lists five debts under $1,000 each. Finally, the \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nSOR lists four debts between $1,000 and $4,000. Applicant received a $5,500 income \ntax refund in 2008. She used that money to buy a car. She did not use any of it to repay \nany debts. Her current automobile is a 2001 vehicle she received as a gift. Applicant \nhas no credit cards. She uses a debit card or checks to pay her bills. She overdraws her \nchecking account on a monthly basis. Between July and December 2009, Applicant \npaid overdraft fees that in some months were $250. Applicant admitted she used credit \ncards to make purchases when she did not have the cash to spend on those items. (Tr. \n33, 37, 38, 46, 47, 66) \n \nApplicant completed answers to two DOHA interrogatories on February 9, 2009. \nShe told the investigator in one set of answers she could not recall the delinquent \naccounts he listed for her. In the second set of answers she either stated she intended \nto file bankruptcy or \u201cwill call to pay off ASAP.\u201d She took no action on the bankruptcy \nfiling until July 2009, and did not resolve any of the delinquent debts by payment. \n(Exhibits 2-4) \n \nApplicant testified her former husband started paying child support only recently. \nHe was frequently unemployed during their marriages, quitting jobs at his whim, and \nleaving the burden of supporting the family to her. Applicant\u2019s brother submitted a \nwritten character statement that supported Applicant\u2019s statements about the lack of \nsupport from her former husband. His statement added information that their mother \nwas helping Applicant financially. He concluded by stating Applicant works hard to be \nthe sole provider for her children and herself. (Tr. 36; Exhibits 4, D)  \n \nApplicant could not coordinate the SOR debts with those listed in her 2009 \nChapter 7 bankruptcy to show which debts were discharged in that legal proceeding. \nApplicant did not explain persuasively why she could not have used her 2008 income \ntax refund to pay the 12 delinquent debts totaling $1,212 instead of buying a car. (Tr. \n42-44) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns. Of these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts \nfound in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nDuring the past decade, Applicant accumulated 21 delinquent debts for a total of \n$15,684.74 that were unpaid or unresolved. She has a history of not meeting her \nfinancial obligations. She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy twice in 10 years. She overdrew \nher checking account regularly during the last five months of 2009, thereby obligating \nherself to pay fees totaling $250 in some months. Applicant demonstrated persuasively \nshe cannot manage her personal finances. AG \u00b6 19 (a) and (c) apply. \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Three mitigating conditions may be \npotentially applicable: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) might apply because of her former husband\u2019s unemployment \nsituations and lack of his financial support to their family. They married and divorced \ntwice. His behavior did not change during those marriages, and the two bankruptcies \nshow the situation continued over a decade. Applicant continued to spend money she \ncould not repay, however, showing she did not act responsibly under the circumstances. \nThis mitigating condition does not apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (c) imposes a two-part requirement for its applicability. Applicant must \nreceive financial counseling and/or there must be clear evidence the situation is under \ncontrol. Applicant received counseling, but only as part of the requirement under the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Code for filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Applicant introduced no \nevidence that she voluntarily sought counseling before she filed bankruptcy. Her \ntestimony that she overdrew her checking account between July and December 2009 \nwhile the bankruptcy petition was being considered by the bankruptcy court shows \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nApplicant has not resolved her financial problems and continues to repeat her financial \nmismanagement. Based on the facts, this mitigating condition does not apply. \n \nThe last potentially applicable mitigating condition pertains to the initiation of a \ngood-faith effort to pay debts or otherwise resolve them. Applicant used a legal method \nto rid herself of at least14 of her debts through the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The U.S. \nBankruptcy Code discharges all debts at the time the court order is entered, regardless \nof whether or not it is listed in the petition and schedules. Applicant\u2019s debts were \ndischarged. However, she had previously used that process in February 1999. She \nlearned nothing in the past decade about management of her personal finances. She \ndid not make any effort to pay any of the creditors listed in the SOR. These actions are \nnot good-faith efforts to resolve her debts. This mitigating condition is not applicable \nunder the facts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been an adult during \nall of her financial difficulties. She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy twice in 10 years, \ndemonstrating she cannot manage her personal finances. She is likely to continue this \ntype of mismanagement into the future, having established a pattern of it. There is no \npermanent behavior change because she continues to overspend her income as shown \nby the overdrafts on her checking account in 2009. Her conduct is frequent and recent. \nNothing has changed for Applicant over the past decade financially. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.v:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On August 5, 2009, I was assigned the case. On August 17, 2009, DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing, which was held on September 21, \n2009. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 7, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through E, \nwhich were admitted into evidence.

After a thorough review of the record, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old quality engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since December 2003, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Friends \nand colleagues state Applicant is extremely competent, trustworthy, and ethical. She \nhas a commitment to excellence, and displays the utmost integrity. (Ex. A) \n \n \nIn August 2000, Applicant purchased a home in Tampa, Florida. Applicant \nobtained a $210,000 mortgage with approximately $1,800 monthly mortgage payments. \n(Ex. E) The home needed a new roof and air conditioners. It also needed repairs to the \nkitchen, bathroom, and pool. (Ex. 2, 3) In May 2006, Applicant obtained a $90,000 \nsecond mortgage from her credit union to pay for the repairs and remodeling. (Ex. 3, 4) \nPrior to the remodeling, the house was appraised at $300,000. (Tr. 37) The remodeling \nwas completed in November 2006. (Tr. 38) Applicant\u2019s February 2007 credit bureau \nreport (CBR) indicated Applicant was current on all her financial obligations including \nher first and second mortgages. (Ex. E) All of the accounts listed in that CBR indicated \nApplicant had paid the accounts satisfactorily or was paying the accounts as agreed. \n(Ex. E)  \n \nAfter having lived in her home for seven years, Applicant received a promotion at \nwork requiring her to move to another state. (Tr. 31) In February 2007, she put her \nFlorida home on the market and received two offers. (Tr. 27, Ex. C) However, both \noffers failed to reach settlement. As the home prices in the area continued to fall, \nApplicant secured a tenant in her home. After a month, the renter stopped paying and \nApplicant had a difficult time evicting the tenant. \n \n \nIn April 2007, she moved to the new state.

She exhausted those funds making mortgage \npayments on the Florida property. (Tr. 28) Additionally, Applicant exhausted one of her \n401(k) retirement plans paying other creditors. (Tr. 33) In April 2008, Applicant was \nunable to continue making her mortgage payments and informed both her first and \nsecond mortgage companies of her problem. The credit union charged-off the second \nmortgage. (Tr. 39) In May 2009, Applicant filed for Chapter 13, wage earner\u2019s plan, \nbankruptcy protection, which was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on September 9, \n2009. (Ex. B, Ex. 6) The Florida home was included in the bankruptcy. (Ex. 5)  \n \nThe mortgage company was granted a relief from the stay to allow it to take \nwhatever actions were possible to sell the house or otherwise reduce their financial \nliability. On July 10, 2009, Applicant surrendered the Florida home to the mortgage \ncompany. (Tr. 40, Ex. B) At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Applicant\u2019s monthly income \nwas approximately $6,800; her net take home pay was approximately $4,600; and she \nhad monthly expenses of approximately $4,500. Additionally, she receives $1,500 per \nmonth rent from a roommate. (Tr. 46) The Chapter 13 plan required $425 monthly \npayments for 59 months. (Ex. 6) Since June 2009, she has been making her monthly \npayments. (Tr. 29) Under the Chapter 13 plan, except for the Florida mortgage \ncompany, all creditors will receive 100% of what they are owed. (Tr. 39, Ex. B0  \n \n \nUnder the bankruptcy code, once the property has been surrendered to a \ncreditor, there is no provision for a debt deficiency. Following the sale of the Florida \nhouse, the creditor can not seek payment for any deficiency from Applicant. (Tr. 35) \nOnly in the case where the debt is reaffirmed following a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a \ncreditor permitted to sue the debtor for a debt deficiency. (Ex. B)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 28, 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) (Ex. 2) lists her mortgage \nas being in foreclosure. Seven months prior to the May 2008 reporting date, her \nmortgage was being \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d (Ex. 2, page 8) Except for the Florida home, \nApplicant\u2019s credit has been excellent. (Tr. 37) That CBR lists 51 additional accounts. \nSome of those accounts are now closed and some are various accounts with the same \ncreditor, but all are listed as paid as agreed. Her credit score prior this incident was 760. \nApplicant\u2019s August 19, 2009 CBR indicates all listed accounts are current. (Ex. D) \n \n \nIn July 2008, Applicant completed her Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP), Standard Form (SF) 86. (Ex. 1) In her SF 86, she \nindicated she had a house in Florida that she had been unable to rent or sell and that it \nwould be going to foreclosure.  \n \n \nApplicant does not have a car payment and was required to surrender her credit \ncards when she filed for bankruptcy protection. (Tr. 36) She is not being contacted by \ncreditors and all of her other obligations are being paid as agreed.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant was behind on her mortgage payments and surrendered the house \nto the mortgage company. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant made a mistake in her real estate purchases. She purchased a second \nhome before selling her first home. Her work required her to relocate from Florida to a \nstate across the country. In February 2007, she put her Florida home on the market. \nEight months later she purchased a home in her new location with another individual. \nApplicant had two offers on her Florida home, but neither went to settlement.  \n \nApplicant=s financial problems were affected by market factors beyond her \ncontrol. Home prices greatly declined following a period of homes being over-valued. \nAG & 20(b) fully applies. The downturn of the market and her inability to sell the home \nwere actions beyond her control. Applicant did all she could to eliminate the debt. She \ntried to rent the property and exhausted her savings. She acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \n \nApplicant has done what she can to eliminate this obligation. In the few months \nafter her move, the market had changed. Market factors prevented the sale of her \nFlorida home, so she secured a renter to help cover the cost of the Florida home. After \npaying rent for one month, the renter stopped paying and Applicant evicted the renter \nwith difficulty. For one year, until February 2008, Applicant was able to make the \nmonthly mortgage payments on the two homes, in part by exhausting her $15,000 \nsavings account.  \n \n \nThe decline in the value of the real estate is not, of itself, the sole cause of \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems. The decline in value has prevented Applicant from \nliquidating the debt through sale of the properties at the amounts owed. However, it was \nthe inability to sell her Florida home that resulted in her being unable to make mortgage \npayments on the house in Florida and her new home. Both are factors factor beyond \nher control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies. The behavior is infrequent. Since the property has been \nsurrendered to the mortgage company, Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy prevents the \nmortgage company from collecting a debt deficiency on the Florida home. There are no \nother delinquent obligations. All of her other accounts have been paid in a timely \nmanner and as agreed. The timely payment of all other obligations, with the exception \nof the Florida property, gives assurance that she will continue to make her monthly \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \npayments to the Chapter 13 plan. The plan will pay all her other creditors 100% of what \nthey are owed. The debt was incurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nThe downturn in the housing market does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nAG & 20(c) partially applies. There has been no showing Applicant has received \nfinancial counseling. However, except for this single debt, Applicant\u2019s finances are \nunder control.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The debt incurred was not the type that \nindicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. Money was not spent frivolously. Applicant has only one outstanding debt. \nNow that she is in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan and has surrendered the Florida home \nto the lender, this debt cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, \nthe issue is not simply whether all her debts are paid\u2014it is whether her financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & \n2(a)(1).)  \n \nI have considered the unique circumstances surrounding her inability to sell her \nFlorida home. Applicant\u2019s reasoning in accepting a work promotion and moving to \nanother state had merit. Before renovations the house was appraised at $300,000. She \nmade the repairs and renovations assuming she would remain in the home. Only after \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nthe work was completed was she told of the promotion and having to move to a new \nstate. The downturn in the housing market caught a large segment of the population by \nsurprise.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted \nthat the concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an \napplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid \noff each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has \u2018. . . established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the \npayment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement \nthat the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan \nbe the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations \nomitted).  \n \nHaving had a bad experience in purchasing a home without first selling the prior \nhome, it is unlikely Applicant will repeat the conduct. Applicant was unable to make her \nmonthly mortgage payments on two houses, but this does not indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. It does not raise \nquestions about her reliability, trustworthiness, or ability to protect classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

On May 21, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective in the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 13, 2009, and waived his right to \na hearing before an administrative judge. On July 27, 2010, he withdrew his waiver and \nrequested a hearing.  (Tr. 8.) On August 9, 2010, DOHA assigned the case to me. On \nNovember 23, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nSeptember 8, 2010, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing, setting the case for September \n21, 2010. The case was heard as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 8 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. He offered \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through U into evidence without objection. The record \nremained open until October 15, 2010, in order to provide him time to submit additional \ndocuments. On September 27, 2010, Applicant transmitted a letter and another exhibit.

He denied all other allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old. In December 1980, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy. \nIn February 2001, he honorably retired as a Chief Petty Officer (E-7). He was an \naviation maintenance control chief. He received eight Navy Achievement Medals, a \nNavy Expedition Medal, and an Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist. He held security   \nclearances while in the Navy.  \n \n \nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant worked for a private company and within four \nyears became the Director of Facilities. He remained there for seven years and then \nworked in landscaping for a short time. In July 2008, he started his current position as a \ncomputer trainer and technician with a federal contractor that provides support for the \narmed forces. (GE 1.)  \n \n \nApplicant married his wife in March 1983. They have three children, ages 24, 21, \nand 17. He has been the main source of family income over the past 25 years.  In June \n2007, his wife began using drugs and gambling, which lead to financial problems and \nthe initiation of a divorce. Applicant was unaware of the extent of his delinquent debt \nsituation or accounts until he was interviewed by the government investigator in \nSeptember 2008 and reviewed his credit report. His wife managed the household \nfinances up to that time. (Tr. 32.) He filed for divorce in June 2009 and anticipates \nfinalizing it soon. (Tr. 32-33.) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports from 2008 and 2009, the SOR alleged that \nApplicant accumulated 15 delinquent debts between 2007 and early 2009 totaling \n$39,069. Those debts were owed to utility companies, credit card companies, \ndepartment stores, and for a car loan. The status of each debt is set out in AE U and \ndocumented by Applicant\u2019s exhibits.  A summary of the debts is as follows: \n \n1. Nine debts, totaling $20,343 are paid. They are listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, \n1.h, 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o.  (AE I, J, N, P, Q, R, J, and S.)   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n2. Applicant started making monthly payments of $100 on two debts listed in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g. The total indebtedness is $1,918.  (Tr. 36, 40; AE K, O.) \n \n3. Applicant is attempting to resolve the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.k. \nThose two debts total $5,429. He has contacted the creditors on more than \none occasion, but been unsuccessful in reaching them. He is willing to pay \nthe debts, which he acknowledged as his obligations. (Tr. 37, 46.)  \n \n4. Applicant\u2019s wife is responsible for the delinquent debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e for \n$1,271. He believes it will be included in their divorce agreement. (Tr. 38.)   \n \n5. Applicant successfully disputed the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.j for $10,112 \nbecause it is his wife\u2019s debt and not his. It will be removed from his credit \nreport. (Tr. 44-46; AE W.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a budget. His net monthly income is $6,690. His expenses \nare $5,013, including payments on his two repayment plans, leaving $1,677 at the end \nof the month for other items. He intends to continue making the payments on the two \ndelinquent debts because he is \u201ctrying to clear my credit up and trying to get the divorce \nbehind me and move on [as] my intentions are to climb the ladder very quickly with [his \ncurrent employer].\u201d (Tr. 56.) He does not intend to have financial problems in the future. \n(Tr. 60.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted three letters of recommendation. His senior program \nmanager, a retired captain in the Navy, has known Applicant for three years. He \nreferred to Applicant as his \u201ctop\u201d associate engineer and detailed his responsibilities, \nwhich involve projects related to the nation\u2019s security. He strongly recommends him for \na security clearance. (Tr. 67; AE A.) His parents also wrote a letter. They believe that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cultimate destiny [is] protecting our Nations\u2019 homeland from terrorist activity.\u201d \n(AE B.) A friend also wrote a supportive letter. (AE C.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified candidly and credibly. Since learning of his debts, he has \ntaken steps to resolve them. He is serious about achieving financial solvency and \nimproving his credit standing. If he receives a security clearance, he may be activated \nand deployed to the Middle East to work on government bases. (Tr. 57.) \u201cThis secret \nclearance means a lot to me and supporting my family and ultimately protecting my \ncountry, which is very near and dear to my heart. . . I\u2019ve always been concerned about \nour nation and our country.\u201d (Tr. 56.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes two disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debt in 2007, which he was unaware of \nuntil interviewed by a government investigator in September 2008. Some of the debt \nremains unresolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. AG \u00b6 20 set forth conditions that could mitigate financial security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some application. Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose between \n2007 and early 2009 while he was married to his wife who began gambling and abusing \nillegal drugs, unbeknownst to him. Those unusual circumstances are unlikely to recur as \nhe is in the process of finalizing a divorce. They do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Similarly, those circumstances were \nbeyond his control. Once he learned of the debts, he began to slowly but responsibly \nresolve them, warranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant presented sufficient evidence to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(c) \nand AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant did not present any evidence that he obtained credit \ncounseling, but he did present evidence that his financial situation is under control, \nbased on the actions he has taken to establish a workable budget and resolve his \ndelinquent debts, including implementing a repayment plan for two debts. He paid nine \nof the 15 delinquent debts and is trying to resolve two debts. He believes one debt will \nbe assumed by his wife when their divorce decree is entered.  \n \nApplicant presented evidence that he successfully disputed one debt that is his \nwife\u2019s, resulting in its deletion from his credit report and triggering the application of AG \n\u00b6 20(e). There is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 48-year-old man, who \nretired from the Navy after more than 20 years of honorable service, during which time \nhe held a security clearance. After leaving military service, he began employment with a \nfederal contractor and continues to support the armed forces\u2019 mission in the Middle \nEast.  Applicant began accumulating delinquent debt in 2007, primarily due to his wife\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nillegal drug use and gambling habits. Since learning of the problems, he systematically \naddressed and resolved about $33,000 of the $39,000 of the SOR-listed debt. Applicant \npaid nine of the 15 SOR-listed debts, successfully disputed one debt, is paying two \ndebts through a repayment plan, and is willing to pay the two debts that remain \nunresolved and total $5,400. One debt will be included in his divorce. At this time, he \nhas established a credible track record of resolving the delinquent debts. His candor \nregarding his financial situation and proactive efforts to achieve resolution of the debts \nhas eliminated any ongoing potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  \n \nGiven his budget and awareness of the negative effect that delinquent debts may \npotentially have on his employment, similar financial problems are unlikely to recur. The \nAppeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial \ncases stating:  \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrates that he has \u2018. . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2 (a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR.1 \n \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial confidence as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He fully met his burden to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n1ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 24, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on May 26, \n2009, and issued a Notice of Hearing on June 16, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on July 8, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into \nevidence, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, but did not submit \nany exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c.  \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and was born in the United States. He graduated from a \nU.S. university in 1979 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. He is \ndivorced, and has a 35-year-old stepson and a 20-year-old biological son with his \nformer wife. His wife and sons were born in the United States. \n \n \nApplicant has worked as an engineer in the aerospace industry for 29 years. In \nJuly 2008, he obtained his current position with a federal contractor. He is a state \nlicensed professional engineer. About 25 years ago, he held a secret security \nclearance. \n  \n \nApplicant worked in Canada from December 1992 through 1999. At his \nemployer\u2019s suggestion, he obtained Canadian citizenship in 1998, and ceased using a \nCanadian work permit, which made his travels to and from Canada easier. He worked in \nCanada until 1999, when he was laid off. He then returned to a job in the United States, \nbut continued to maintain Canadian residency until 2002 when he divorced. His wife \nand biological son also became Canadian citizens in 1998. All three of them hold dual \ncitizenship with the United States and Canada. His son and former wife continue to \nreside in Canada. He works and resides in the United States. (Tr. 23-26) \n \n \nApplicant enjoys certain benefits as a result of his Canadian citizenship. His son \nattends a Canadian university for a fraction of the cost of tuition at a U.S. institution, \nwhich saves Applicant money. Applicant has access to free Canadian health care \nshould he need it in the future. (Tr. 39) He has a Canadian retirement fund with an \nestimated value of $18,000. He has two Canadian bank accounts to which he transfers \nmoney for his son and ex-wife. (Tr. 42-43) He voted in one Canadian election in 1998. \n(Tr. 43) \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant applied for a Canadian passport after a border \nofficial advised him that his Canadian identification card could no longer be used to gain \nentry into the country. He uses the passport because it allows him to travel easily \nbetween the United States and Canada. (Tr. 40) He intends to renew the passport when \nit expires in 2012. (Tr. 39) He has no intention of relinquishing his Canadian citizenship \nor passport. (Tr. 46-47) He intends to maintain both as long as his son resides there.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn his closing argument, Applicant asserted that he is a more patriotic U.S. citizen \nand less of a security risk because of his experiences living in Canada. He appreciates \nthe opportunities and freedoms of the United States when compared to other countries. \n(Tr. 52) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9, the security concern involving foreign preference arises: \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern, two of \nwhich may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial, or business \ninterests in another country; \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country;  \n(7) voting in a foreign election; and \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \nApplicant was born in the United States. In 1998, he became a citizen of Canada. \nHe resided there from approximately 1992 to 2002. He obtained a Canadian passport in \n2007 that expires in 2012. His son attends a Canadian university, which benefits \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant because of the lower tuition costs. He intends to use the Canadian health care \nsystem in the event he becomes ill. He maintains a Canadian bank account for \nconvenience. He voted in an election in 1998. Based on that evidence, the Government \nproduced substantial evidence of disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1), \n10(a)(3), 10(a)(4), 10(a)(5), 10(a)(7) and 10(b). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those conditions, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 11 provides \nsix conditions that could mitigate security concerns under this guideline:  \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign \ncountry; \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and, \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \nNone of the above conditions apply. Applicant was born in the United States, not \nCanada. He has no intention of renouncing his Canadian citizenship or surrendering his \nCanadian passport. He intends to exercise his rights as a Canadian citizen, in particular \naccess to its health care system. He did not present evidence that his security office \napproves his use of his Canadian passport to travel to and from the country. There is no \nevidence that the United States Government encouraged him to vote in 1998.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 53-year-old, mature \nman, who works for a federal contractor. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential concern under \nGuideline C resulted from choices he made in 1998 when he decided to become a \nCanadian citizen while residing there, and again in 2007 when he decided to obtain a \nCanadian passport for ease of travel. Although he has not resided in Canada since \n2002, he continues to exercise his rights as a Canadian citizen. Although he professes \nstrong loyalty to the United States, he has no intention of renouncing his Canadian \ncitizenship or surrendering his passport because of the benefits and advantages that \nthey provide him. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s preference is conflicting because he \nvoluntarily chooses to reap the benefits offered by both countries and is unwilling to \ndeclare his undivided commitment to one country because of the potential loss of \nbenefits from the other. Applicant has clearly made an economic choice that establishes \nhis commitment to Canada, yet he also wants to ensure he maintains whatever benefits \nhe can derive from the U.S. Subsequently, he is reluctant to relinquish ties to Canada \ndespite the adverse implication it may pose to his employment.     \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under foreign preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On September 24, 2008, Applicant was\ninterviewed by an investigator of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\nconcerning overdue financial debts he had accumulated. In his interrogatory answers\ndated March 6, 2009, Applicant checked \u201cYes,\u201d that he agreed with and adopted the\ninvestigator\u2019s summary of the September 24, 2008, interview, and that it could be used\nin evidence (GE 2). On June 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nFebruary 18, 2010\n\n2\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on June 29,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 31, 2009 for a hearing on September\n16, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, five exhibits (GE I\nthrough 5) were admitted in evidence without objection to support the government's\ncase. Applicant testified. The record remained open until September 30, 2009 (Tr. 47) to\nallow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. No evidence was\nsubmitted. DOHA received the transcript on September 24, 2009. The record closed on\nSeptember 30, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges financial considerations (Guideline F), based on two judgments\nand ten debts totaling $163,873. The largest delinquent account is a foreclosed\nmortgage. The other delinquent debts are credit cards, a telephone debt, a landlord-\ntenant debt, department store debts, and a check cashing debt. Applicant admitted \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.l. He denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.I, 1.j., and 1.k. Applicant\nprovided no documentation to support his denials.\nApplicant is 35 years old. Following four months of unemployment, Applicant was\nhired by a defense contractor in August 2008 at his current job as a lead technician. He\nhas held a security clearance since June 1994 (GE 1). He is married with no children. \nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in July 2007, after he and his former wife\npurchased a house (GE 5 at 8). Around the time of purchase, Applicant testified that he\nand his former wife had over a 700 credit score because they always paid their bills on\ntime (Tr. 43). A month after purchasing the house, he bought and installed a water\nfiltration system (GE 5). Two months after purchasing the house, he obtained a loan for\nrepairs to the house (Id.; Tr. 26). Shortly, after obtaining the loan, his former wife left\nhim. When she filed for divorce, he had to retain an attorney (Tr. 19). In April 2008, he\nlost his job and was unemployed for four months (GE 1 at 12). The 12 accounts,\nincluding the two judgments, became delinquent between October 2007 and August\n2008. Applicant indicated he has been trying to sell the house since July 2008 (Tr. 29),\nbut he provided no documentation to support his testimony. \nThe delinquent account in \u00b6 1.a. represents a water purification system Applicant\npurchased for the house that subsequently went into foreclosure (\u00b6 1.j.). The filtration\ncreditor filed a judgment for $6,779 in November 2008. The delinquent account in \u00b6 1.b.\nrepresents a loan Applicant obtained in September 2007 to renovate his house. The\ncreditor filed a judgment against Applicant in December 2008 for $8,305. \n\n3\nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s reason for denying \u00b6 1.e. was that he paid his landlord\nextra money to allow Applicant\u2019s pet to live in his apartment (Tr. 13-14). But, in his\ninterview in September 2008, he stated that he moved into an apartment even though\nthe carpet from the previous tenant had not been replaced. Because he needed\naccommodations immediately, he agreed with the landlord to accept the apartment \u201cas\nis.\u201d After he moved out of the apartment, a new landlord charged him for damage to the\napartment carpet. He informed the new landlord about his agreement with the old\nlandlord, but the agreement could not be located (Id.). \n\u00b6 1.i. is a deficiency balance of $8,354 for a vehicle that belonged to his wife.\nAccording to Applicant, she was obligated to pay the debt under a divorce decree (Tr.\n15). Applicant did not present the divorce decree to support his claim. In addition,\nApplicant and his former wife signed the auto installment loan in a joint capacity (GE 5). \nRegarding \u00b6 1.j., Applicant claimed he had mortgage insurance to cover the\nforeclosure on his house. No documentation was presented (Tr. 15-17, 19).\nThe delinquent account identified in \u00b6 1.l was caused by Applicant\u2019s former\ngirlfriend who started using drugs in December 2006. Applicant indicated she cleared\nout his checking account to support her habit (Tr. 39). He found out about the $736 debt\nafter two checks he wrote for groceries were returned for insufficient funds (Tr. 40-41).\nApplicant provided restitution for both checks (Id.).\nApplicant has had no financial counseling, and has not attempted to consolidate\npayment of his debts in a debt plan (GE 2 at 5). He does not have a checking or savings\naccount, and does not use a bank (Tr. 30). \nOn various occasions within the last year, Applicant testified that he called\nseveral creditors, asking them whether they would reduce the delinquent balances or\nformulate a payment plan, but has received no reply (Tr. 25). About a month before the\nhearing, Applicant asked some attorneys about Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and wanted to\nknow whether filing a petition would reduce his chances of obtaining a security\nclearance (Tr. 22-23). \nWhole Person Information\nApplicant provided no character evidence about his job performance or his\nreputation in the community where he lives.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nused in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\n\n4\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on commonsense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" Finally, the administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\n\u00b6 18. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nThere are two disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 that must be considered.\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) is applicable because of the\nsubstantial amount of debt Applicant is unable to pay. AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history not meeting\nfinancial obligations) must also be considered due to Applicant\u2019s history of not meeting\nhis obligations.  \nThe first four mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n\n5\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) must be removed from consideration\nbecause the 12 debts fell delinquent in the last three years. Applicant\u2019s failure to take\nany kind of documented action raises continuing doubt about his reliability and\njudgment. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from April to August 2008, and his divorce, were\nevents beyond his control, and deserve consideration under the first prong of AG \u00b6\n20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). But the\nmitigating condition also requires the individual to act responsibly under the\ncircumstances. Applicant has been employed about a year. Yet, he has provided no\ndocumented evidence of attempting to address the listed delinquencies. He receives\nlimited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant has had no financial counseling as defined by AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). He is familiar with\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, but he has taken no steps toward that course of action. AG \u00b6\n20(c) does not apply as there is no indication Applicant\u2019s indebtedness is being resolved\nor is under control. Applicant receives no consideration under FC MC \u00b6 20.d. (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) because of his lack of action in handling his overdue debts and judgments. The\nfinancial guideline is found against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the financial guideline. I have also weighed\nthe circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person\nconcept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was 33 years old when he bought the water purification system and\napplied for the loan to renovate his house. Buying the system and obtaining the loan\nwithin months of purchasing his house indicates that more responsible decisions could\n\n6\nhave been made before landing in such deep debt. Even though Applicant had a\nfavorable credit score before he purchased his house in July 2007, he still should have\nevaluated the equally important issue of whether he could afford the purchase by\nmanaging the additional costs of maintaining a home.\nApplicant stated he tried several times to reduce the debt balances or establish\npayment plans with the creditors. Regarding his largest debt, he said he had mortgage\ninsurance which would have extricated him from financial responsibility for the\nmortgage. Failure to produce evidence of mortgage insurance or of contacting the\ncreditors, i.e., a log written by Applicant tracking his efforts to contact the creditors,\nimpeaches Applicant\u2019s claims of attempting to deal with his indebtedness. With no\ndocumentation and no evidence of financial counseling, Applicant has not met his\nburden of demonstrating his security worthiness. The financial guideline is resolved\nagainst him. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n\n7\n",

On September 24, 2008, Applicant was\ninterviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator about overdue\nfinancial debts he had accumulated. In his interrogatory answers dated March 6, 2009,\nApplicant checked \u201cYes,\u201d that he agreed with and adopted the investigator\u2019s summary of\nthe September 24, 2008, interview, and that it could be used in evidence (GE 2). On\nJune 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nJune 7, 2010\n\n2\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). \nApplicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on June 29,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 31, 2009, for a hearing on\nSeptember 16, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, five exhibits\n(GE I through 5) were admitted in evidence without objection to support the\ngovernment's case. Applicant testified. The record remained open until September 30,\n2009 to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. (Tr. 47) No\nevidence was submitted. DOHA received the transcript on September 24, 2009. The\nrecord closed on September 30, 2009.\nOn February 18, 2010, I issued a Decision denying Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance based on financial considerations (Guideline F). Applicant appealed\nmy adverse decision. The Appeal Board subsequently issued a Remand Decision on\nMay 7, 2010. The Appeal Board indicated that at the close of the hearing I kept the\nrecord open for two weeks for Applicant to submit documentation to support his case in\nmitigation (Tr. 45-46), and Applicant did not submit any documentation within the time\nallowed.

Next, the Appeal Board stated that Applicant filed an appeal brief\non April 5, 2010 \u201ccontaining new evidence that raised the possibility that Applicant\nsubmitted a document which never reached the Judge.\u201d (footnote omitted) (Appeal\nBoard Decision at 2) The Appeal Board concluded \u201cthat an equitable resolution of this\ncase would be for the Applicant to present the document to the Judge.\u201d (Id.) In a\nfootnote, the Appeal Board found that Applicant\u2019s appeal brief includes new evidence\nthat post-dates my decision (February 18, 2010), and is inadmissible on remand. (Id.) \nI issued an Order on May 14, 2010, directing Applicant to submit the \u201cdocument\u201d\n(referred to in the Appeal Board\u2019s Decision) to me by May 24, 2010. I received no reply. \nIn reply to my Order dated May 14, 2010, Department Counsel submitted its\nResponse on May 24, 2010. The Response is a nine-page document (six of the nine\npages are Applicant\u2019s Appeal Brief) consisting of a two-page response by Department\nCounsel, a cover letter (April 6, 2010) from the Chairperson of the DOHA Appeal Board,\na one-page appeal brief (April 5, 2010) from Applicant, a three-page Consent Final\nJudgment of Dissolution of Marriage dated July 23, 2008, a one-page receipt dated\nMarch 12, 2010, from an unlisted creditor, and a one-page copy of a check written by\nApplicant\u2019s wife on March 25, 2010. The entire nine-page exhibit shall be admitted into\nevidence as Remand Exhibit (RE 1). The record in this case closed on May 24, 2010.\nIn Department Counsel\u2019s Response to my Order, he indicated he had reviewed\nhis files and found no documents submitted to his office after the hearing. The only\ndocuments he received were those Applicant submitted in his six-page appeal brief filed\nwith the Appeal Board on April 5, 2010. Department Counsel registered his objection to\nthe admission of any documents contained in the Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. Department\nCounsel\u2019s objection is overruled regarding the July 2008 Consent Final Judgment of\nDissolution of Marriage (Dissolution Decree), specifically the references to the house (\u00b6\n\n3\n1.j) and the 2002 van (\u00b6 1.I). I support my ruling with Applicant\u2019s testimony at the\nhearing where he referred to the Dissolution Decree while explaining he and his former\nwife were to equally split the proceeds or loss of a sale of their house, and under the\ndecree, his former wife was required to accept responsibility of the van. (Tr. 15, 16, 18-\n19) Department Counsel\u2019s objection is granted regarding the two payment documents\nbecause both documents are dated after February 18, 2010, the date I issued the\noriginal decision.\nI shall assume that Dissolution Decree, or part of the decree, is the \u201cdocument\u201d\nthe Appeal Board is referring to in their May 7, 2010, decision directing that the\nequitable resolution of the case calls for Applicant to present the \u201cdocument\u201d to me. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges financial considerations (Guideline F), based on two judgments\nand ten debts totaling $163,873. The correct amount of delinquent debt is $179,738.\nThe largest delinquent account is a foreclosed mortgage (\u00b6 1.j, $151,000). The other\ndelinquent debts are credit cards, a telephone debt, a landlord-tenant debt, department\nstore debts, and a check cashing debt. Applicant admitted \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.l. He\ndenied \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.I, 1.j, and 1.k. Applicant provided no documentation to\nsupport his denials.\nApplicant is 36 years old. Following four months of unemployment, he was hired\nby a defense contractor in August 2008 at his current job as a lead technician. He has\nheld a security clearance since June 1994. (GE 1) He is married with no children. \nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in July 2007, after he and his former wife\npurchased a house. (GE 5 at 8) Around the time of purchase, Applicant testified that he\nand his former wife had over a 700 credit score because they always paid their bills on\ntime. (Tr. 43) A month after purchasing the house, he bought and installed a water\nfiltration system. (GE 5) Two months after purchasing the house, he obtained a loan for\nrepairs to the house. (Id.; Tr. 26) Shortly, after obtaining the loan, his former wife left\nhim. When she filed for divorce, he had to retain an attorney. (Tr. 19) In April 2008, he\nlost his job and was unemployed for four months. (GE 1 at 12) The 12 accounts,\nincluding the two judgments, became delinquent between October 2007 and August\n2008. Applicant indicated he has been trying to sell the house since July 2008 (Tr. 29),\nbut he provided no documentation to support his testimony. \nThe delinquent account in \u00b6 1.a. represents a water purification system Applicant\npurchased for the house (\u00b6 1.j.) that subsequently went into foreclosure. The filtration\ncreditor filed a judgment for $6,779 in November 2008. The delinquent account in \u00b6 1.b.\nrepresents a loan Applicant obtained in September 2007 to renovate his house. The\ncreditor filed a judgment against Applicant in December 2008 for $8,305. \n\n4\nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s reason for denying \u00b6 1.e. was that he paid his landlord\nextra money to allow Applicant\u2019s pet to live in his apartment. (Tr. 13-14) But, in his\ninterview in September 2008, he stated that he moved into an apartment even though\nthe carpet from the previous tenant had not been replaced. Because he needed\naccommodations immediately, he agreed with the landlord to accept the apartment \u201cas\nis.\u201d After he moved out of the apartment, a new landlord charged him for damage to the\napartment carpet. He informed the new landlord about his agreement with the old\nlandlord, but the agreement could not be located. (Id.) The delinquent account is found\nagainst Applicant.\n\u00b6 1.i. is a deficiency balance of $8,354 for a vehicle that belonged to his wife.\nAccording to Applicant, she was obligated to pay the debt under a divorce decree. (Tr.\n15) The Dissolution Decree shows that Applicant\u2019s wife is responsible for the 2002 van.\nI find for Applicant under \u00b6 1.i.\nRegarding \u00b6 1.j., Applicant claimed he had mortgage insurance to cover the\nforeclosure on his house. No documentation was presented. (Tr. 15-17, 19) My finding\nagainst Applicant remains unchanged. \nThe delinquent account identified in \u00b6 1.l was caused by Applicant\u2019s former\ngirlfriend who started using drugs in December 2006. Applicant indicated she cleared\nout his checking account to support her habit. (Tr. 39) He found out about the $736 debt\nafter two checks he wrote for groceries were returned for insufficient funds. (Tr. 40-41).\nApplicant provided restitution for both checks. (Id.) The delinquent account is not listed\nin the March 2009, credit report. (GE 4) I find \u00b6 1.l in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant has had no financial counseling, and has not attempted to consolidate\npayment of his debts in a debt plan. (GE 2 at 5) He does not have a checking or savings\naccount, and does not use a bank. (Tr. 30)\nOn various occasions within the last year, Applicant testified that he called\nseveral creditors, asking them whether they would reduce the delinquent balances or\nformulate a payment plan, but received no reply. (Tr. 25) About a month before the\nhearing, Applicant asked some attorneys about Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and wanted to\nknow whether filing a petition would reduce his chances of obtaining a security\nclearance. (Tr. 22-23) \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant was advised that he could submit character references from his job.\n(Tr. 44-45) Applicant provided no character evidence about his job performance or his\nreputation in the community where he lives.  \n\n5\nThe information Applicant submitted in RE 1 shows the following:\n1. Dissolution Decree (executed July 23, 2008). On the first page, last paragraph,\nApplicant and his former wife were ordered to place the house (\u00b6 1.j) on the market for\nsale by July 31, 2008, and were to share equally in the proceeds or loss from the sale.\nApplicant explained the mortgage company (\u00b6 1.j) foreclosed on the house in December\n2009, and had not completed processing the private mortgage insurance. According to\nApplicant, when the company completed the process, they would send Applicant a\nstatement reflecting the balance had been paid. No documentation was provided to\nshow proof that Applicant had mortgage insurance or that the house was foreclosed in\nDecember 2009, or the current status of negotiations to pay off Applicant\u2019s share in the\nhouse. \n2. Dissolution Decree (executed on July 23, 2008). The second page, first full\nparagraph, shows that Applicant\u2019s former wife was to be the sole owner of the 2002 van\n(\u00b6 1.i). \n3. Applicant identified a new finance company that is administering the loan for\nhis 2004 truck, also referred to in the divorce decree on the second page, first full\nparagraph. Applicant claimed he is ahead by a month on his truck payments. In support\nof his claim of being current on his 2004 truck payments, he provided a one-page\ndocument (attachment to his Appeal Brief) showing he had paid $2,585 to a creditor on\nMarch 12, 2010. However, the creditor\u2019s name on the attachment is different from the\nfinance company he mentioned in his Appeal Brief. Further, the creditor is not listed in\nthe SOR. Even if the creditor was listed in the SOR, the documentation post-dates my\nFebruary 18, 2010 decision, and is inadmissible on remand.\n4. Applicant also provided a copy of a check his wife wrote on March 25, 2010, to\nthe telecommunications company (original creditor) identified in \u00b6 1.c. The amount of\nthe check is $45.00. The check copy constitutes new evidence because it post-dates\nmy decision in this case. This evidence is inadmissible on remand. \n5. Regarding \u00b6 1.e, Applicant stated he was retaining counsel to handle the case\nwith the apartment and the soiled carpet. Again, no documentation was provided. The\ndebt remains unresolved. \n6. Applicant stated he was still continuing to deal with creditors to clear his credit\nrecord. Applicant provided no information to show how he was dealing with his creditors\nto clear his record.\nPolicies\nThe administrative judge's ultimate goal is a fair and impartial decision that is\nbased on commonsense. The decision should also include a careful, thorough\nevaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole-person concept.\" Finally, the\n\n6\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\n\u00b6 18. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nOn remand, I reiterate my finding that there are two disqualifying conditions\nunder AG \u00b6 19 that are applicable. AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nis applicable because of the substantial amount of debt Applicant is unable to pay. AG \u00b6\n19(c) (a history not meeting financial obligations) must also be considered due to\nApplicant\u2019s history of not meeting his obligations.  \nThe first four mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) does not apply because there are 12\ndebts that became delinquent between October 2007 and August 2008. Applicant\nprovided the Dissolution Decree showing that he and his former wife were to split the\nproceeds or loss from a sale of the house (\u00b6 1.j). However, except for Applicant\u2019s claim,\nthere is no evidentiary support in the record that Applicant has mortgage insurance, or\nthe house was officially foreclosed in December 2009, or that the lender was negotiating\n\n7\nwith Applicant\u2019s mortgage insurance company to pay off the deficiency balance.\nBecause the Dissolution Decree supports Applicant\u2019s claim that his wife is responsible\nfor the 2002 van, a finding will be made in his favor under \u00b6 1.i. Appellant\u2019s failure to act\non 10 of the remaining delinquent accounts continues to cast doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant receives no mitigation under\nAG \u00b6 20(a).\nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from April to August 2008, and his divorce, were\nevents beyond his control that warrants mitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b)\n(the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). However,\nfollowing his marriage dissolution in July 2008, Applicant found his current employment\nin August 2008 and has been working for about a year. The mitigation Applicant\nreceives under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) is reduced dramatically by the lack of\ndocumented action to satisfy the remaining debts. In addition, my favorable finding\nunder \u00b6 1.i (2002 van) is based on the July 2008 Dissolution Decree. My favorable\nfinding under \u00b6 1.l is based on the fact that the delinquent account does not appear on\nApplicant\u2019s March 2009 credit report. Applicant has taken no affirmative action since\nAugust 2008 to address the other delinquent debts. Considering the entire record,\nApplicant receives limited mitigation under \u00b6 20(b).\nApplicant has had no financial counseling as defined by AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). He is familiar with\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, but he has taken no steps toward that course of action. Although\nApplicant is no longer responsible for the van (\u00b6 1.i) and the delinquent account in 1.l,\nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply as there is no clear indication Applicant\u2019s indebtedness is\nbeing resolved or is under control. Applicant receives limited consideration under \u00b6\n20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) based on the restitution he provided to the bank identified in \u00b6 1(l).\nConsidering the evidence as a whole, the limited mitigation Applicant receives under AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d), is not enough to overcome his financial delinquencies under AG\n19(a) and 19(c). The financial guideline is found against Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the financial guideline. I have also weighed\nthe circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole-person\nconcept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n8\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was 33 years old when he bought the water purification system and\nobtained a loan to renovate his house. Buying the system and receiving the loan within\nmonths of purchasing his house indicates that more responsible decisions could have\nbeen made before landing in such deep debt. Even though Applicant had a favorable\ncredit score before he purchased his house in July 2007, he still should have carefully\nevaluated the equally important issue of whether he could afford the house purchase\nwhile also managing the additional costs of the filtration system and the loan to renovate\nthe house.\nApplicant stated he tried several times to reduce the debt balances or establish\npayment plans with the creditors. Regarding his largest debt, he said he had mortgage\ninsurance which would have extricated him from financial responsibility for the\nmortgage. Failure to produce evidence of mortgage insurance, the December 2009\nforeclosure, and/or negotiations with the mortgage insurance company to have the\nmortgage paid, undercuts the credibility of Applicant\u2019s claims about the present status of\nthe house. Declaring that he has hired a lawyer to pursue the damaged carpet\nallegation in \u00b6 1.e carries little weight without documentation. Similarly, I can assign no\nweight to Applicant\u2019s unsupported statement that he is continuing to handle his creditors\nto restore his credit/credit score when he has provided no documentation to support his\nclaims. Having weighed and balanced all the evidence, including the Dissolution\nDecree, I resolve \u00b6 1.i in Applicant\u2019s favor. I also correct my original finding (Decision,\nFebruary 18, 2010) in \u00b6 1.l to be for Applicant. From an overall standpoint however, it is\nlikely Applicant\u2019s current financial problems will persist in the future. See, \u00b6 2(a)(9).\nApplicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the financial guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance is denied. \n                      \nPaul J.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On March 23, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nG (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On August 3, 2010, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contain\nan error and whether the Judge erred in her application of the relevant mitigating conditions.\nConsistent with the following discussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a Defense\ncontractor.  She has a history of alcohol abuse, which includes convictions for three separate\nalcohol-related offenses.  Two of these were for DWI, and the other was for underage drinking.  The\nlast of Applicant\u2019s offenses, a DWI, occurred in 2006.  Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended\nfollowing each DWI.  When interviewed during the investigation of her application, Applicant stated\nthat she did not intend to drink alcohol in the future, because doing so was not in her best interest.\nHowever, she later admitted that, subsequent to that interview, she had drunk two beers in late\nDecember 2008.  \nIn deciding the case adversely to Applicant, the Judge noted Applicant had not provided\ncorroborating evidence for her claims to have consumed alcohol responsibly since her last DWI\nincident.  The Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s three convictions, her two driver\u2019s license suspensions,\nand her three periods of probation following those convictions rendered her written statements\ninsufficient to rebut the trustworthiness concerns raised by the File of Relevant Material.  \nApplicant notes that twice in the Analysis portion of the decision the Judge stated that\nApplicant had been convicted three times of DWI.  Applicant contends that these two statements\nwere erroneous.  Applicant is correct, in that the record clearly demonstrates that she was convicted\nof DWI only twice.  We note that the Findings of Fact section of the decision correctly describe only\ntwo incidents of DWI, and, in her whole-person analysis, the Judge properly cited to three \u201cincidents\ninvolving alcohol,\u201d rather than to three of DWI.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s erroneous statements\nwere not the result of her having misread the evidence, and they do not establish that she based her\nadverse decision on a mistaken understanding of the nature of Applicant\u2019s convictions.  Because\nthere is no reason to conclude that the errors in question actually affected the outcome of the case,\nthey are harmless.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 08-00801 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 6, 2009).\nIn support of her appeal Applicant has submitted a letter of recommendation, which is  new\nevidence not contained in the record.  We cannot consider this letter.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo\nnew evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d).  See also, e.g., ADP Case No.\n08-09058 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 18, 2009).     \n\n3\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

In light of the entirety of the record evidence, the Judge\u2019s decision not to grant Applicant\na trustworthiness designation is sustainable.

    "judges_analysis": "",
    "discussion": ", we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a Defense contractor. She has a history of alcohol abuse, which includes convictions for three separate alcohol-related offenses. Two of these were for DWI, and the other was for underage drinking. The last of Applicant\u2019s offenses, a DWI, occurred in 2006. Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended following each DWI. When interviewed during the investigation of her application, Applicant stated that she did not intend to drink alcohol in the future, because doing so was not in her best interest. However, she later admitted that, subsequent to that interview, she had drunk two beers in late December 2008. In deciding the case adversely to Applicant, the Judge noted Applicant had not provided corroborating evidence for her claims to have consumed alcohol responsibly since her last DWI incident. The Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s three convictions, her two driver\u2019s license suspensions, and her three periods of probation following those convictions rendered her written statements insufficient to rebut the trustworthiness concerns raised by the File of Relevant Material. Applicant notes that twice in the Analysis portion of the decision the Judge stated that Applicant had been convicted three times of DWI. Applicant contends that these two statements were erroneous. Applicant is correct, in that the record clearly demonstrates that she was convicted of DWI only twice. We note that the Findings of Fact section of the decision correctly describe only two incidents of DWI, and, in her whole-person analysis, the Judge properly cited to three \u201cincidents involving alcohol,\u201d rather than to three of DWI. We conclude that the Judge\u2019s erroneous statements were not the result of her having misread the evidence, and they do not establish that she based her adverse decision on a mistaken understanding of the nature of Applicant\u2019s convictions. Because there is no reason to conclude that the errors in question actually affected the outcome of the case, they are harmless. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 08-00801 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 6, 2009). In support of her appeal Applicant has submitted a letter of recommendation, which is new evidence not contained in the record. We cannot consider this letter. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d). See also, e.g., ADP Case No. 08-09058 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 18, 2009). 3 The record supports a",

On March 23, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 29, 2010, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 20, 2010, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing 11 Items, \nAugust 3, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nand mailed a copy of it to her the same day.

On July 7, 2010, DOHA \nassigned the case to me.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the four allegations contained in \nthe SOR. Those admissions are incorporated into the following findings. \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old and unmarried. In August 2006, she began a position \nwith a defense contractor for a health services company. Prior to that, she worked as an \noffice assistant from July 2005 to May 2006. She was a waitress from September 2000 \nto May 2006.   \n \n  \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol abuse. In October 2003, Applicant was \narrested and charged with (1) Driving While Intoxicated (DWI); (2) DWI 4th Degree, and \n(3) Operating a Motor Vehicle Without One Headlight. She plead guilty to DWI 4th \nDegree and was placed on two years of supervised probation and ordered to undergo \nan alcohol assessment. The other two counts were dismissed. She was fined $1,000 of \nwhich $700 was stayed, Her driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. She was 17 \nyears old. (GE 7, 8.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn December 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with Minor in \nConsumption. She pled guilty and was placed on unsupervised probation for eight \nmonths. She paid a $100 fine and court costs. Prior to the arrest she attended a party \nwith high school friends. (GE 7, 9.) \n \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) DWI \u2013 Operate Motor \nVehicle Under the Influence of Alcohol, and (2) DWI -Operating Motor Vehicle \u2013 Alcohol \nConcentration 0.08 Within 2 Hours. In June 2007, she pled guilty to Count 1, and was \nsentenced to 365 days in jail, 335 days suspended, fined $3,000, and placed on \nprobation for two years, until July 2009. Her driver\u2019s license was suspended for one \nyear. She was ordered to pay $217 in court fees, which included the cost of a Chemical \nDependency Evaluation. She attended a party before the arrest. (GE 7, 10.) \n \n \nDuring an interview with a government investigator in October 2008, Applicant \nstated that she was never diagnosed as abusing alcohol or being alcohol dependant. \nShe started consuming alcohol in June 2001, when she was 17 years old. She admitted \nthat prior to June 2006 she consumed four to six beers about three times a week and \noccasionally to the point of intoxication. From June 2006 to the time of the interview, \nshe claimed that she had not consumed any alcohol and did not intend to consume it in \nthe future. She realized that consuming it was not in her best interests. Other than being \ninvolved in the legal system three times for issues related to alcohol consumption, she \ndoes not believe that her alcohol consumption has caused problems in her life.  (GE 7 \nat 4.) On February 27, 2009, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories, in which she \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nacknowledged that she consumed two beers on New Year\u2019s Eve. (GE 6.) She also \nstated that she learned from her mistakes and is a good employee. (Id.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish current good judgment, trustworthiness or reliability. I was unable to evaluate \nher credibility, demeanor, or character in person since she elected to have her case \ndecided without a hearing. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I, ADP II, and ADP III are classified as \u201csensitive \npositions.\u201d (See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must \nbe met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, \nthe person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the \nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d \n(See \nRegulation \n\u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1.) \nThe \nDeputy \nUnder \nSecretary \nof \nDefense \n(Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates \ntrustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense \nSecurity Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense \ncontractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive \nbefore any final unfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 \nC8.2.1.)  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \nIn 2003, 2004, and 2006, Applicant was arrested and convicted of DWI. Based \non that evidence, the Government raised a security concern under AG \u00b6 22(a). She \nadmitted that from June 2001 to December 2008, she occasionally consumed alcohol to \nexcess and the point of intoxication, which facts are sufficient to raise a disqualifying \ncondition under AG \u00b6 22(c). \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate those disqualifications are provided under AG \u00b6 23: \n (a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n None of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a history of \nconsuming alcohol to excess, spanning from June 2001 to December 2008. Given that \nhistory and three DWI convictions, her behavior casts doubt on her current \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. Applicant denied that \nshe has a problem with alcohol consumption. In October 2008, she asserted that she \nhad stopped consuming alcohol from June 2006 to that point and had no intention to \nconsume it in the future. In January 2009, she admitted that she had two beers on \nDecember 31, 2008. To-date, she did not provide any independent evidence to \nestablish a pattern of responsible alcohol consumption or to corroborate her assertions, \nwhich is necessary to apply AG \u00b6 23(b). The record does not contain evidence to \nsupport the application of AG \u00b6 23(c) or AG \u00b6 23(d).  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 25-year-old \nwoman, who has worked for a defense contractor since August 2006. She was \nconvicted three times for incidents involving alcohol. In July 2009, she completed her \nprobationary period for the third conviction. Although she stated that she no longer \nabuses alcohol, she did not present any independent evidence to corroborate that \nassertion. Given her three convictions, two driver\u2019s license suspensions, and the \nimposition of probationary terms in 2003, 2004, and 2007, her written statements are \ninsufficient evidence upon which to conclude that her alcohol consumption no longer \nposes a security risk.    \n   \nOn balance, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate reliability \nand trustworthiness concerns arising from her alcohol consumption. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to ADPI/II/III sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n                                  \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn May 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 31, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was originally assigned to an \nadministrative judge on November 17, 2009, and reassigned to me on March 23, 2010. \nAt the request of Applicant, through his attorney, the hearing was delayed to \naccommodate Applicant who was working overseas.

The Government also requested administrative notice be taken \nof Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through IV. I granted the request and the documents were \nconsidered. Applicant and three witnesses testified on his behalf. He offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through G. They were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 5, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 58 years old. He was born in Afghanistan and moved to Germany \nwhen he was approximately 17 or 18 years old. While there, he met his older brother \nand his brother\u2019s wife, who invited him to go to the United States. In 1969, he obtained a \ntourist visa to enter the United States. Later he decided to attend school and applied for \nand received a student visa. He earned an associate\u2019s degree, a bachelor\u2019s degree, and \na master\u2019s of business degree. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1981. He \nmarried in 1985. His wife was also an immigrant from Afghanistan and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in the 1980s. They were married in the United States, and they \nhave two children who were born in the United States.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. He has four brothers. One is deceased and \nthe other three are U.S. citizens. Two of his brothers live in the United States. One \nserved in the U.S. Navy, another has worked as a linguist for the U.S. Army. The \nbrothers are married and their wives are U.S. citizens, as are their children. One brother \nlives in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E). He is a professor at an American university in \nthe U.A.E. His brother intends on returning to the United States in the future. His brother \nowns property in the United States. His brother\u2019s grown children were born in the United \nStates and live here. Applicant also had four stepbrothers, two of whom are deceased. \nHe has had no contact with them since he left Afghanistan when he was 17 or 18. He \nhad two stepsisters, one of whom is deceased. He has not had personal contact with \nthe other since he left Afghanistan.2  \n \n \nIn the 1980s, Applicant worked for an employer and believed the company was \ngoing to be downsized or dissolved. His supervisor searched for employment in \nanticipation of losing his job. He found a job in the U.A.E. He contacted Applicant and \nasked him to join the new company. Anticipating that he was going to lose his job, \nApplicant accepted the job offer in the U.A.E. In 1987, he moved his wife and five-\nmonth-old son there. He always intended on returning to the United States. On their \nvacations they would return to the United States. He filed and paid his U.S. federal \nincome tax returns each year. Applicant\u2019s daughter was born in the U.A.E. He had her \n \n1 Tr. 38-45, 84. \n \n2 Tr. 46-63. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nbirth certificate stamped by the U.S. embassy in the U.A.E., certifying that she was an \nAmerican citizen. He worked for one employer, a private oil company, from 1987 until \n1999. He changed jobs in 1999, and was employed by a new employer, a private water \nand electricity authority from 1999 until 2003.3  \n \nIn 2001, Applicant and his wife decided they wanted their children educated in \nthe United States. His son has a learning disability, and they wanted to use the \navailable educational resources for him in the United States. In addition, the United \nStates was where Applicant wanted to live. He looked for a job in the United States, but \nwas unsuccessful in finding one. He moved his family back to the U.S., but he remained \nworking in the U.A.E. to support his family. In June 2003, without a job, he severed all \nties with the U.A.E., and returned to the United States to be with his family. They lived \noff of their savings until December 2003. He continued to look for employment during \nthis time.4  \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant accepted a job with a federal contractor to serve as a \nlinguist/interpreter in Afghanistan. Applicant went on dangerous combat missions and \nwas in harm\u2019s way while deployed. He was deployed for 330 days a year. Every six \nmonths he returned to the United States to visit his family. He explained that he puts his \nlife in danger in his job to protect the interests of the United States and the military. He \nstated his duty is to his adopted country. He changed employers in 2007-2008, but \ncontinued to work in the same capacity. He was not deployed for a period of time after \nhe changed employers and worked in the United States for several months before \ndeploying again to Afghanistan.5 \n \n \nApplicant has no immediate family ties in Afghanistan. He does not know if he \nhas any other relatives living in Afghanistan, except his stepbrothers and stepsister. He \ndoes not know where they live. He has never attempted to contact any relative in \nAfghanistan. All of his assets are in the United States. He owns a home, property in \nanother state, and a time-share property. He and his wife have Individual Retirement \nAccounts and bank accounts. He intends on retiring in the United States. His ties to \nAfghanistan are through his employment.6  \n \n \nApplicant visited his brother in the U.A.E. one time when he was traveling from \nAfghanistan back to the United States to visit his family. He saw him for a couple of \nhours during a layover.7 \n \n \n3 Tr. 66-75. \n \n4 Tr. 75-81. \n \n5 Tr. 81-83, 99-107. \n \n6 Tr. 45, 85, 107-108. \n \n7 Tr. 88-89. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf. While Applicant was deployed to \nAfghanistan in 2006, his wife received a telephone call from a woman claiming to be \nApplicant\u2019s stepsister. She begged for money, claiming her family was sick and \ndestitute. Applicant\u2019s wife was compassionate and wired $400 to the woman. She told \nApplicant about the contact and gift. Applicant was angry and told his wife not to \nrespond to any further calls from his stepsister. He explained it could have been anyone \ncalling claiming to be related to him. Applicant has had no contact with his stepsister \nsince he left Afghanistan when he was 17 or 18 years old. He does not know how she \nfound him. The stepsister continued to call, but Applicant\u2019s family was instructed not to \nanswer the phone. Eventually, they changed their phone number and have not heard \nfrom the stepsister again. He does not intend on ever contacting his stepsisters or \nstepbrothers.8 \n \n \nThe director of a charitable organization devoted to assisting Afghani orphans \ntestified on behalf of Applicant. She has known him since approximately 2002 or 2003. \nHe has assisted her in organizing and contributing to fundraisers for the cause. He is \nconsidered a reliable, honest, and trustworthy person and she believes he exercises \ngood judgment.9  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter testified on his behalf. She recently graduated from college \nand is applying to medical schools. She was born in the U.A.E. and returned to the \nUnited States when she was 13. She intends to remain in the United States. She \ndescribed her mother as a \u201cgood soul\u201d when she sent money to Applicant\u2019s stepsister. \nShe described her father as an honest and trustworthy person who risks his life to \nsupport his family and the United States. She is proud of him and his loyalty to his \nadopted country.10  \n \n \nApplicant provided numerous character letters and letters of recommendation \nfrom senior military officers, senior enlisted personnel, and civilian personnel stationed \nwith him in Afghanistan and covering the period from 2005 to the present.11 He has \nworked as an interpreter for a combat action team. Due to his ability to speak different \ndialects and his leadership ability, he has been engaged in increasingly more vital \nassignments. Those writing on his behalf detail his proven dedication and loyalty to the \nUnited States. He has proven his commitment, enthusiasm, and courage in numerous \ndangerous situations. He is engaged in combat patrols and important key engagements. \nIn addition, it was noted: \u201cOne of his greatest assets is his versatility. [Applicant] can \naccomplish his duty on a combat patrol in the mountains under enemy contact one \nminute and can translate at key leader engagements with high ranking [police officials] \n \n8 Tr. 63-66, 89-99, 109-117, 119-120. \n \n9 Tr. 27-35. \n \n10 Tr. 118-121. \n \n11 AE A. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nand local village elders the next.\u201d12 He is the consummate team player who has \nintegrated himself as the interpreter, but also a valued member of the platoon. Another \nperson commented: \u201c[Applicant] came to Afghanistan not only to interpret but to \nparticipate in the cause to help the Afghan people and do his part serving our country. \nHe was passionate coming here to help.\u201d13  \n \nAfghanistan14 \n \n \nAfghanistan is located in Southwestern Asia and borders Pakistan, Iran and \nRussia. It has been an independent nation since 1919, after the British relinquished \ncontrol. A monarchy ruled from 1919 until a military coup in 1973. Following a Soviet-\nsupported coup in 1978, a Marxist government emerged. In 1979, Soviet forces invaded \nand occupied Afghanistan. A resistance movement eventually led to an agreement \nknown as the Geneva Accords, signed by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States, and \nthe Soviet Union, which ensured Soviet forces withdrew by February 1989. The \nresistance party was not part of the Accords and refused to accept it. A civil war ensued \nafter the Soviet withdrawal. In the mid-1990s, the Taliban rose to power largely due to \nanarchy and the existence of warlords. The Taliban sought to impose extreme \ninterpretation of Islam and committed massive human right violations. The Taliban also \nprovided sanctuary to Osama Bin-Laden, Al Qaida, and other terrorist organizations.  \n \n \nAfter the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, demands to expel Bin-Laden and \nhis followers were rejected by the Taliban. U.S. forces and a coalition partnership \ncommenced military operations in October 2001 that forced the Taliban out of power in \nNovember 2001. The new democratic government took power in 2004 after a popular \nelection. Despite that election, terrorists including Al-Qaida and the Taliban continue to \nassert power and intimidation within the country. Safety and security are key issues, \nbecause these terrorists target United States and Afghan interests by suicide \noperations, bombings, assassinations, carjacking, assaults, and hostage taking. At this \ntime, the risk of terrorist activity remains extremely high. The country\u2019s human rights \nrecord remains poor and violence is rampant.  \n \n \nCivilians continue to bear the brunt of the violence and increased attacks. \nDespite the loss of some key leaders, insurgents have adjusted their tactics to maintain \nmomentum following the arrival of additional U.S. forces. It is suspected that the Taliban \nwas most likely responsible for suppressing voter turnout in the August 2009 elections \nin key parts of the country. The Taliban\u2019s expansion of influence in northern Afghanistan \nsince late 2007 has made the insurgency a country-wide threat. \n \n \nAfghan leaders continue to face the eroding effect of official corruption and drug \ntrade. Criminal networks and narcotics constitute a source of funding for the insurgency \n \n12 Id. \n \n13 Id.

Other insurgent groups and anti-coalition organizations also operate in \nAfghanistan. Insurgents have targeted Non Government Organizations, journalists, \ngovernment workers, and United Nation workers. Instability along the Pakistan-Afghan \nfrontier continued to provide Al-Qaida with leadership mobility and the ability to conduct \ntraining and operational planning, targeting Western European and U.S. interests. The \nUnited States Department of State has declared that the security threat to all American \ncitizens in Afghanistan remains critical as no part of the country is immune to violence.  \n \nUnited Arab Emirates15 \n \n \nThe United Arab Emirates is located in the Persian Gulf region, and it is a \nfederation of emirates, each with its own ruler. The federal government is a \nconstitutional republic headed by a president and council of ministers. There are no \ndemocratically elected legislative institutions or political parties, and no general election. \nOnly 15-20% of the U.A.E.\u2019s population are U.A.E. citizens. \n \n \nThe U.A.E. contributes to the continued security and stability of the Gulf and the \nStraits of Hormuz. It is a leading partner in the campaign against global terrorism, \nproviding assistance in military, diplomatic, and financial arenas since September 11, \n2001. The U.A.E is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Following Iraq\u2019s \ninvasion and attempted annexation of Kuwait, the U.A.E. has sought to rely on the \nGCC, the United States, and other Western allies for its security. The U.A.E. believes \nthat the Arab League needs to be restructured to become a viable institution and would \nlike to increase strength and interoperability of the GCC defense forces. The U.A.E. was \none of only three countries to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of \nAfghanistan and two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were U.A.E. nationals.  \n \n \nThe U.S. and U.A.E. have enjoyed friendly relations since 1971. Private \ncommercial ties, especially oil, have developed into friendly government-to-government \nties which include security assistance. The U.S. and U.A.E. relations increased \ndramatically when the U.S. led the campaign to end Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The \nU.S. and U.A.E. launched a strategic partnership and it has been a key partner in the \nWar on Terror. However, the U.A.E.\u2019s cooperation in counterterrorism efforts has been \nhampered by the lack of a mutual legal assistance treaty between the two nations. \nDubai in the U.A.E. has been a key transfer point for illicit sales of nuclear technology to \nIran, Libya, and North Korea.  \n \n \nThe U.A.E. does not recognize dual nationality, and authorities have confiscated \nU.S. passports of U.S./U.A.E. dual nationals. U.S. citizens who also hold U.A.E. \ncitizenship may be subject to laws that impose special obligations on citizens of the \nU.A.E. Citizens of the United States who become involved in disputes of a commercial \nnature have had their U.S. passports confiscated by local firms or courts, and have \nbeen subjected to travel bans that preclude them from being able to depart the U.A.E. \nuntil the dispute is resolved.  \n \n15 HE III, IV. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nU.A.E. ports host more U.S. Navy ships than any port outside the U.S. The U.S. \nwas the third country to establish formal diplomatic relations with the U.A.E. and has \nhad an ambassador resident in the U.A.E. since 1974.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n8 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s brother resides in the U.A.E. Applicant \nhad contact with him in 2007. In 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife had telephonic contact with a \nstepsister, presumably who is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, and provided her \nmoney. Applicant worked in the U.A.E. for 16 years for a private oil company and later \nfor a private water and electricity authority. Applicant\u2019s contact with relatives living \noutside of the United States and his lengthy employment in the U.A.E. is sufficient to \nraise a security concern. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the foreign government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.  \n \nThere is sufficient evidence of the insurgency operations being conducted in \nAfghanistan against American forces. There is also evidence that Afghanistan has a \ndismal human rights record and has active terrorist groups operating within their \nborders. There is also some evidence that the U.A.E has a questionable human rights \nrecord and is one of only three countries that recognizes the Taliban, which sponsors \nterrorism. This places the burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \ncontacts in Afghanistan and the U.A.E. do not pose a security risk, and he is not in a \nposition to be forced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and his connections to family \nmembers and his former employers. With its negative human rights record, its \ngovernment, and the violent insurgency that operate within the Afghan borders, it is \nconceivable that Applicant\u2019s family members could be vulnerable to coercion. It is also \nconceivable that Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s residency in the U.A.E creates a heightened risk. \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d16 Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.17 \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8, including the following: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n \n16 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2005).  \n \n17 See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is an American citizen working for an American university in \nthe U.A.E. He has property in the U.S. and his children live here. He intends on \nreturning to the United States in the future. Applicant visited his brother when he was \ntransiting through the U.A.E. on his return to the U.S. in 2007. Although there are some \nissues with the U.A.E., for the most part it is an ally of the U.S. It is unlikely Applicant \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between his brother and the interests of \nthe United States. Applicant has worked for the past six years, under dangerous combat \nconditions, supporting the United States, and its military. He has proven his deep and \nlongstanding loyalty to the United States. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States.18 I find mitigating condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) \napplies to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brother. \n \nWhile Applicant was deployed, and unbeknownst to him, his wife sent a step-\nsister some money. She did this due to her charitable nature, not because she or \nApplicant had a close relationship with the stepsister. When Applicant learned of the \ntelephone call and gift, he admonished his wife and told her not to have further contact \nor send money again. They have since changed their telephone number. Prior to this \ncontact, Applicant has not had any contact with his stepsister since he left Afghanistan \nwhen he was 17 or 18 years old. All of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are U.S. \ncitizens. I find AG \u00b6 8(c) applies. His contact with his stepsister was nonexistent except \nfor the one gift in 2006. There is little likelihood that the previous contact would create a \nheightened risk for foreign influence or coercion.  \n \nApplicant worked in the U.A.E. when he had difficulty finding employment in the \nUnited States. His family returned when he and his wife decided they wanted the \nchildren educated in the United States. All of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are in the \nUnited States. He has worked as a linguist/translator for the past six years with the U.S. \nmilitary. He returns to visit his family twice year, but otherwise is deployed to \nAfghanistan serving with U.S. troops in combat operations. He has no other connection \nwith the U.A.E. where he was once employed. There is no evidence he maintains ties in \nthe U.A.E., other than with his brother which was previously discussed. In the unlikely \nevent an issue was to arise, there is no doubt Applicant would resolve any conflict in \nfavor of the United States, due to his longstanding and deep loyalty to his adopted \n \n18 See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) citing ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at \n2-3 (App. Bd. May, 30, 2006). The Appeal Board recognized that in Guideline B cases, \u201cwhere the \napplicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his compliance with security procedures \nand regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had \nmade a significant contribution to the national security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he \ncan be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.\u201d \n\n \n11 \n \n \ncountry. He has repeatedly proven himself by working for the U.S. military, in harm\u2019s \nway, for the past six years. I find mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2 were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nbeen a U.S. citizen for almost 30 years. His contact with Afghanistan is through his work \nwith the U.S. military. All of his immediate family members are citizens of the United \nStates. The only nominal contact with a family member was in 2006, when his wife gave \na gift to a stepsister. He does not maintain contact with the employers he worked for \nwhen his was in the U.A.E. Applicant has proven for the past six years his devotion to \nduty and loyalty to the United States by serving in dangerous combat operations \nalongside our military. Those with whom he has served provided strong evidence of his \ncharacter and commitment to his adopted nation. There is no evidence to suggest that \nany ties Applicant may have outside of the United States would in any way influence \nhim. It is clear that if any conflict of interest was ever raised that Applicant would resolve \nit in favor of the United States. Applicant\u2019s family and livelihood has been imbedded in \nthe United States. All of his financial interests are in the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department  Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement, and Guideline F, Financial Considerations. I also conclude that \nthere is insufficient record evidence to conclude that Applicant is disqualified, pursuant \nto the Bond Amendment, from holding a security clearance. His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on July 28, 2008. On April 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nSeptember 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n In his Answer to the SOR, dated May 12, 2009, Applicant requested a decision \non the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government did not request a hearing within 20 \ndays of receipt of Applicant\u2019s Answer. (See Directive, Enclosure 3, Additional \nProcedural Guidance (E3.1.7)). The Government then compiled its File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on June 23, 2009. The FORM contained documents identified as \nItems 1 through 8. By letter dated June 24, 2009, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM \nto Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections \nwithin 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on June 29, 2009. His response \nwas due on July 29, 2009. Applicant did not file additional information within the \nrequired time period. On September 3, 2009, the case was assigned to me for a \ndecision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H, \nDrug Involvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.), and ten allegations of financial \ndelinquency under Guideline F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.j.). In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the five Guideline H allegations. He admitted \nfour of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b., 2.d., 2.f., 2.j.) \nHe denied one Guideline F allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) as a duplicate of the allegation at \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. There was insufficient evidence in the record to substantiate the allegation \nand to rebut his denial. Additionally, he denied the following five Guideline F allegations: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.e., 2.g., 2.h., and 2.i. Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered herein as \nfindings of fact. (Item 1; Item 4.)  \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the documentary record before me, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, never married, and employed in information technology \nby a government contractor. From 2001 to 2008, he was self-employed in information \ntechnology. (Item 5.) \n \n \nOn September 17, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator \nfrom the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). On January 30, 2009, in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a signed notarized statement that \nacknowledged and adopted the authorized investigator\u2019s summary of his interview as \naccurate. He also affirmed his understanding that his responses to the interrogatories \nand the content of the investigator\u2019s report might be used as evidence to determine his \nsuitability for a security clearance. (Item 6 at 8.) \n \n \nApplicant has used marijuana, with varying frequency, for approximately 27 \nyears, from 1981 to September 2008.1 He suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder, \n \n1 The investigator reported that Applicant had abstained from marijuana use between 1995 and 2003. \nHowever, in his responses to interrogatories, Applicant stated: \u201cI do not have enough confidence in my \nmemory to say, \u2018He did not use marijuana from 1995 until 2003.\u201d (Item 6 at 3, 6.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndepression, and anxiety. His problems with depression and anxiety began in \nadolescence. He has been under the care of a psychiatrist since 1995. Applicant \ndescribed his medical treatment as follows: \n \nI\u2019ve been prescribed at least 20 different medications with limited success \nand various side-effects. The only thing that I have found that can \neffectively stabilize my mood and reduce the anxiety is marijuana. When \nit\u2019s out of my system, I\u2019m less than useless. I become depressed, \nimpatient, unmotivated, hopeless, and withdrawn. I have recently begun \ntaking St. John\u2019s Wort in addition to my prescribed medications in hopes \nthat it will be something that can help me reduce (or perhaps eliminate) \nthe marijuana. \n \n(Item 5 at 17.) \n \n \nBeginning in 2003, Applicant used marijuana three times a day: in the morning, \nafter work, and before going to bed at night in order to relax. He found that the \nmarijuana had a calming effect on him. He used marijuana on the morning of the day he \nwas interviewed by the authorized investigator from OPM. As of September 17, 2008, \nhe purchased marijuana every two weeks. He spent about $240 a month on marijuana. \n(Item 6 at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant told the investigator that he self-medicated with marijuana in order to \nbe a productive person. He stated that he believed himself to be addicted to marijuana, \nand he believed he could not function without it. (Item 6 at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant was never arrested for illegal drug use, and his illegal drug use was \nlimited to marijuana. Nothing in the record establishes that Applicant received a \ndiagnosis of drug abuse or drug dependence from a medical professional, nor does the \nrecord establish that he sought medical treatment specifically for his drug use. His \nfamily and coworkers did not know that he used marijuana. In a notarized statement, \ndated January 30, 2009, Applicant stated: \u201cMy point of contact (manager) is aware that I \nuse marijuana.\u201d His friends knew he used the drug, and he used marijuana with friends \nabout twice a month. (Item 6 at 3, 6.)  \n    \n \nApplicant reported a gross monthly income of $3,100. He was responsible for \nfiling a Form 1099 to pay his income taxes at the end of the tax year. He identified the \nfollowing monthly fixed living expenses: house payment, $489; car payment, $289; \nautomobile insurance, $65; utilities, $120; association fees, $200; medications, $35; \ndebt for advertising his former business, $320; and purchase of marijuana, $240. He \nstated that, in the past, he had paid the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $320 each \nmonth, but had not done so recently. His monthly disposable income did not include \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nsetting money aside to pay his income taxes.2 Applicant acknowledged that he had not \npaid his federal income taxes for several years. He also acknowledged he had not paid \nhis state income taxes since 2000. (Item 6 at 4, 7.) \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted four delinquent debts of \napproximately $31,219. Two of the debts were substantial: a $17,945 federal tax lien \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b.) and a delinquent business debt of $12,018 (SOR \u00b6 2.f.) Neither debt has \nbeen satisfied. Additionally, Applicant admitted that a notice of lien had been filed \nagainst him for $1,016 (SOR \u00b6 2.d.), and the debt remained unsatisfied. While these \ndelinquent debts remained unsatisfied, Applicant spent about $240 a month on \nmarijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.j.). (Answer to SOR; Item 6 at 3, 4, 7.) \n \n \nIn his September 17, 2008, interview with an authorized investigator, Applicant \nadmitted a state tax lien of $2,328 to his state taxing authority and acknowledged that \nhe had made no payments on the lien. In his response to the SOR, he denied the lien \nand stated that the lien had been satisfied. However, he failed to provide documentation \nto corroborate satisfaction of the lien. I find his denial is not credible in light of his other \nstatements in the record. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.; Answer to SOR; Item 6 at 7.) \n \n \nIn his September 17, 2008, interview with the OPM authorized investigator, \nApplicant admitted the $621 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.i., and he acknowledged that it \nwas unpaid. He also admitted that the $537 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.g. and the $581 \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h were his debts and remained unpaid. Applicant also told the \ninvestigator that he had paid the $974 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.e. However, he did not \nrecall the amount of the debt or when it was paid. (Item 6 at 4.) \n \n \nApplicant told the investigator that his financial problems arose when he had his \nown business and acquired a great number of debts he could not pay. He could not \nrecall the specifics of any of the debts, but he stated he intended to contact his creditors \nand satisfy those debts that were in collection or charged-off status. (Item 6 at 4.) \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e., 2.g., \n2.h., and 2.i., claiming that the debts were not his because they were in charged-off \nstatus. (Item 4 at 2, 3.) \n \n \nNothing in the record establishes that Applicant received consumer credit \ncounseling. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \n \n2 Later, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reported that his medication cost $758 per month. \nHe also reported that he had failed to submit monthly payments of $320 on the business debt he owed, \nand the account was subsequently in collection status. (Item 6 at 7.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nIn SOR \u00b6 1.e., the Government alleged that Applicant was disqualified under the \nprovisions of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c (the Bond Amendment) from holding a security \nclearance. By memorandum dated June 20, 2008 (hereafter cited as Memorandum), the \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (HUMINT, Counterintelligence & Security) issued \ninterim guidance for the implementation of the Bond Amendment. The interim guidance \nprohibited all Federal agencies from granting or renewing a security clearance to any \nperson who is an unlawful user of a controlled substance or who is an addict. \n(Memorandum at 2.) \n \nThe Memorandum defines \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substance\u201d as \u201ca person \nwho uses a controlled substance and has lost the power of self-control with reference to \nthe use of the controlled substance\u201d and \u201cany person who is a current user of the \ncontrolled substance in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician.\u201d \n(Memorandum at 2.) \n \nThe Memorandum further specifies that \u201csuch [current] use is not limited to the \nuse of drugs on a particular day, or within a matter of days or weeks before, but rather \nthat the unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is \nactively engaged in such conduct.\u201d Additionally, the Memorandum defines \u201caddict\u201d of a \ncontrolled substance as \u201cany individual who habitually uses any narcotic drug so as to \nendanger the public morals, health, safety, or welfare; or [who] is so far addicted to the \nuse of narcotic drugs as to have lost the power of self control with reference to his \naddiction.\u201d (Memorandum at 2.)   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24(a) defines drugs as \u201cmood and behavior altering \nsubstances.\u201d The definition of drugs includes \u201c(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nand (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d AG \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n \nThe record shows that Applicant admitted the illegal use and possession of \nmarijuana, with varying frequency, for approximately 27 years, from 1981 to at least \nSeptember 17, 2008. He was using marijuana when he completed his e-QIP on July 28, \n2008, and he used marijuana on the morning of September 17, 2008, the same day he \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nwas interviewed by an authorized OPM investigator. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana is an \nhabitual, long-standing, lifestyle choice. \n \nWhen he completed his e-QIP, Applicant described marijuana as \u201cthe only thing \nthat I have found that can effectively stabilize my mood and reduce [my] anxiety.\u201d When \nhe had no marijuana in his system, applicant felt \u201cless than useless,  . . . depressed, \nimpatient, unmotivated, hopeless, and withdrawn.\u201d He told the authorized investigator \nthat he believed himself to be addicted to marijuana. \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with an illegal drug, marijuana, casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  It also raises security concerns about \nhis ability or willingness to protect classified information and to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use raises security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(h).3  \n \nTwo Guideline H mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If Applicant\u2019s drug use happened \u201cso long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\u201d on his \n\u201ccurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 26(a) might be \napplicable in mitigation. If Applicant \u201cdemonstrated [an] intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future\u201d by \u201c(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\u201d (3) abstaining from drug use for \nan appropriate period; and (4) signing a \u201cstatement of intent with the automatic \nrevocation\u201d of his security clearance \u201cfor any violation,\u201d then AG \u00b6 26(b) might be \napplicable.  \n \nThe documentary record shows that Applicant\u2019s drug use as of September 2008 \nwas on-going and frequent. As of January 30, 2009, the documentary record again \nreflects that he acknowledged marijuana use. He also maintained contacts with drug-\nusing associates, and he used drugs regularly with them. Nothing in the record \nsuggests that he abstained from drugs for an appropriate period in order to demonstrate \nan intent not to abuse drugs in the future. Because he believed that only marijuana \ncould reduce his frequent depression and anxiety, Applicant\u2019s use of the illegal drug \noccurred under circumstances that are likely to recur. The record reflects a strong \nlikelihood that he may not be able to abstain from drug use in the future. \n \nThe Memorandum defines \u201ccurrent use\u201d as unlawful use [that] has occurred \nrecently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct.\u201d The \nrecord in this case is silent regarding the degree and frequency of Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana since September 2008. Absent testimony from Applicant on the record about \nhis current marijuana use and intent to use marijuana in the future, I conclude that there \nis insufficient evidence in the record to establish that Applicant is an addict who \n \n3 AG \u00b6 25(a) reads: \u201cany drug abuse [as defined at AG \u00b6 24(b)].\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c) reads: \u201cillegal drug \npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.\u201d AG \u00b6 25(h) reads: \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly \nand convincingly commit to discontinuing drug use.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n \n \n\u201chabitually uses any narcotic drug so as to endanger the public morals, health, safety or \nwelfare.\u201d Additionally, while Applicant\u2019s  own statements establish that, as of September \n2008 and January 2009, he was \u201can unlawful user of a controlled substance,\u201d there is \ninsufficient evidence in this record to establish that he is a current user of marijuana and \nthat he \u201chas lost the power of self-control with reference to the use of the controlled \nsubstance.\u201d  \n \nI conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply in mitigation to the security \nconcerns raised by the facts in Applicant\u2019s case. I also conclude that there is insufficient \nrecord evidence to establish that the Bond Amendment applies to this Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Under AG \u00b6 19(f), a disqualifying condition can arise when an \nindividual\u2019s \u201cfinancial problems are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling \nproblems, or other issues of security concern.\u201d Moreover, \u201cfailure to file annual [f]ederal, \nstate, or local income tax returns as required . . .\u201d can raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19(g). \n \nApplicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and did not pay his creditors. \nInstead of paying his creditors, he devoted $240 a month to purchasing and using an \nillegal drug. He failed to file his state and federal taxes, which resulted in tax liens for \nwhich he failed to provide evidence of satisfaction. This evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. If the \nfinancially delinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might \napply.  If \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply. If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply. Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. Moreover, the delinquencies \nremain unpaid and have occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur. He has \nnot received financial counseling, and he had not made good faith efforts to pay or \nsettle his delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant reported that some of his delinquent debt resulted from business \nlosses. However, he did not specify how the losses occurred and what he did to remedy \nor contain them. It is unclear that the business losses were beyond his control. \nAdditionally, the record does not reflect that Applicant\u2019s actions in the face of his \nfinancial difficulties were reasonable and responsible. In his interview with an authorized \ninvestigator, Applicant expressed his intent to satisfy and settle his delinquent debts in \nthe future. However, in determining an individual's security worthiness, the Government \ncannot rely on an Applicant\u2019s unsupported promise to resolve his outstanding debts at \nsome future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  I conclude that \nnone of the guideline F mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was candid in discussing \nhis long use of marijuana and how, in September 2008, he used the drug in an attempt \nto alleviate his depression and anxiety. However, he failed to recognize how this \nconduct could compromise his ability to protect classified information. \n \n Applicant has failed to satisfy his delinquent debts, and he fails to understand \nthat he is responsible for debts that have been charged off and may no longer appear \non his credit reports. He lacks a detailed, credible plan to resolve his current \ndelinquencies and to avoid financial problems in the future. His reported use of his \nlimited resources to purchase illegal drugs instead of paying his legitimate creditors \nraises concerns about his judgment and reliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and financial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.d. through 2.j.: Against Applicant \n \n                       \n \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",
