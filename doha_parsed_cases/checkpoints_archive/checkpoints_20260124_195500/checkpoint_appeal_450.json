Applicant requested a decision \non the written record.  On July 21, 2021, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his fifties and is married with children. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and has \nbeen working for a government contractor since 2019. He failed to file his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2012-2018 as required. He attributed this failure to going through unspecified financial \ndifficulties. He estimated that he owes between $25,000 and $70,000 in delinquent taxes and \nindicated he was working with a tax resolution company to resolve his tax delinquencies, but \nprovided no documentation.  None of the  mitigating conditions apply. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents that were not presented to the Judge for \nconsideration. The Appeal Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nOn appeal, Applicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that he provided no documentation \nof his efforts to resolve his tax delinquencies. In this regard, we first note that Applicant\u2019s SOR \nresponse provided the name and telephone number of the tax relief company as well as his case \nnumber with that company. To the extent that he may have believed the Judge would contact the \ntax relief company to verify his claim that the delinquent tax returns were filed, he was mistaken. \nA Judge is an impartial fact-finder and has no authorityto serve as an investigator, such as contacting \npotential witnesses independently to interview them, which would be inconsistent with his or her \nduty of impartiality. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03709 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018). We also note \nthat Applicant\u2019s SOR Response contains IRS documents, including notices that his claims for \nrefunds for tax years 2014 and 2015 were disallowed in 2020. These documents are some evidence \nthat his Federal income tax returns for those years were filed. Consequently, the Judge\u2019s finding that \nApplicant presented \u201cno documentation\u201d of his efforts to resolve his tax filing delinquencies is \n2 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n            \n              \ninaccurate.

As the \nAppeal Board has previously noted, it is reasonable for a Judge to expect an applicant to present \ndocumentation corroborating his or her actions taken to resolve alleged financial problems. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). In this case, the Judge\u2019s overall conclusion \nthat Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \ntax filing deficiencies is sustainable.   \nApplicant also argues that he has taken steps to rectify his tax problems in a timely manner \nby working with the tax resolution company. This argument is not sufficient to show that the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.3.   \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed harmful error.  The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Applicant requested a decision \non the written record. On April 20, 2021, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges four delinquent student loan debts. The Judge entered adverse \nfindings for each allegation. He stated that Applicant did not present sufficient evidence regarding \nthe reasons her loans went into delinquency, nor did she demonstrate a track record of debt payment. \nApplicant contends on appeal that she submitted documents that the Judge did not receive. She \nattached these documents to her brief. Although we cannot consider new evidence, we will consider \nsuch matters insofar as they bear upon threshold issues such as due process.  See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-01764 at 1-2 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2019). In this case, the documents that Applicant has \nattached to her brief are, in fact, included in the record. Applicant has presented no reason to believe \nthat she was denied an opportunity to present evidence. \nApplicant notes that one of her documents cites to the President\u2019s decision to hold student \nloan payments in abeyance as a Covid 19 emergency relief measure. Applicant\u2019s argument is not \nsufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor \nhas Applicant shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). The Judge \nfound that Applicant\u2019s student loans became delinquent by 2017, several years prior to the \nPresident\u2019s issuance. The Judge properly considered Applicant\u2019s financial history. Cf. ISCR case \nNo. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd Jun. 7, 2021). Applicant states that her career aspirations may be \nimpaired if she does not have a clearance. The Directive does not permit us to consider the impact \nof an adverse decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03024 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn July 2, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge John Bayard Glendon denied Applicant\u2019s request for a securityclearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nApplicant, who is in his forties, is married with adult children. He honorably served in the \nU.S. military and has previously held a security clearance. The SOR alleged that he had eight \ndelinquent debts totaling about $31,900. He admitted the debts in the SOR. The Judge found that \neach debt remained unresolved and concluded that Applicant had not initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors and none of the mitigating conditions were established.  \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, mis-weighed \nthe evidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. He \nargues, for example, that the Judge erred in failing to give proper weight to Mitigating Condition \n20(b), i.e., the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, \ndivorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, by pointing out that he lost his job in 2015, \nearned significantly less in subsequent jobs, and resolved some debts that were not alleged in the \nSOR. This argument is not persuasive. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant\u2019s \njob loss cannot be viewed as having resulted from conditions largely beyond his control because he \nwas fired from that job for violating company policies and he did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances by failing to contact the creditors or develop plans to repay the debts. In short, none \nof Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Moreover, his \narguments are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Id. \nIn his brief, Applicant requests \u201ca probationary period be instituted.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. To \nthe extent that he is requesting a conditional security clearance, we conclude that Applicant has not \nestablished that the granting of an exception under Appendix C of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \nmerited. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On June 29, 2021, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged seven delinquent debts, the Judge finding against her on two of \nthem. One of these was a charged-off credit card for nearly $13,500 and the other a charged-off \nautomobile loan for nearly $9,000. Neither of these debts have been resolved. Applicant attributed \nher financial problems to a marital separation that left her with debts and with responsibility for a \nchild. Applicant did not begin making payments on any of her SOR accounts until after DOHA \nissued the SOR.  \nIn concluding that Applicant had not mitigated concerns arising from the two debts described \nabove, the Judge stated that she had been employed for the majority of her adult life and that since \nher divorce in 2015 she has remarried and purchased a home. He stated that she had not presented \nevidence that her long-standing debts are being addressed or that she has received financial \ncounseling.  Accordingly, he concluded that Applicant had not met her burden of persuasion as to \nmitigation. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s appeal includes matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. In her brief she notes such things as her marital difficulties, her having paid off \nthe smaller SOR debts, and her having worked for her employer for thirteen years. Applicant\u2019s \narguments are not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in \nthe record or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nShe states that her clearance allows her to continue working and maintain a steady income. The \nDirective does not permit us to consider the adverse impact of an unfavorable decision.  See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 17-03024 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 9, 2020). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision.

On October 5, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested and charged with \nElectronic Enticement of a Minor in 2017. He was convicted of felony attempted sexual assault, \nsentenced to confinement for 18 months, placed on probation until mid-2023, and required to \nregister as a sex offender. This allegation was cross-alleged under Guideline D. At the hearing, \nApplicant admitted the material facts alleged in the Guideline J allegation.

He \nargues that \u201c[b]eing on probation until July 2023 is irrelevant to the amount of time that has passed \nand is not a disqualifying condition.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3.

Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief raises the following issues: whether he was denied due process, \nwhether the Judge erred in the findings of fact and credibility determination, and whether the \nJudge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nApplicant is in his thirties, is married, and has a child. He earned a master\u2019s degree about \nsix years ago. For the past 11 years, he has been working for a defense contractor and has held a \nsecurity clearance. \nIn a security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he used marijuana about five times \nbetween mid-2011 and mid-2019 while possessing security clearance eligibility. He admitted \nthose facts again in his background interview and his response to the SOR. In his response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), he stated he misspoke earlier about his \nlast use of marijuana, indicating it occurred in mid-2018. He indicated that he has matured and \npromised never to use marijuana again. \nBased on his repeated assertions, Applicant\u2019s latest use of marijuana more likely occurred \nin mid-2019. His marijuana use did not occur under unusual circumstances. He acknowledged \nhis marijuana use was illegal under Federal law.  \u201cRegardless of whether his last use of marijuana \nwas about two or three years ago, Applicant exercised extremely bad judgment using marijuana \nover a seven or eight-year period, even though infrequently, while he held a security clearance.\u201d \nDecision at 5.  He has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement.  \nApplicant contends that the summary of his background interview (FORM Item 3) does \nnot reflect statements the investigator made to him that he relied on to his detriment. His brief \nstates: \nThe summary of interview makes no mention to (sic) the assurances provided to \nthe Applicant, which included statements to the effect of: \u201cAs long as you are open \nand honest and truthful, everything will be okay\u201d at the outset of the interview. The \ninvestigator also told the Applicant that he \u201cshould not worry\u201d, and that \u201che [the \ninvestigator] has never seen a similar case of \u201csmoking weed a few times\u201d lead to \nan unfavorable decision\u201d at the conclusion of the interview.  Of course, this advice \nwas highly improper. The Applicant relied on this evidence in making his elections \nthroughout this process. He did not elect a personal appearance in front of an \nAdministrative Judge simply because he was relying on this positive assurance. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, he did not object to the summary of his interview because of these \nsame assurances. Had the Applicant been aware of the potential consequences of \nhis disclosure, he certainly would have elected alternative options and challenged \nthe record on many more occasions.  [Appeal Brief at 5.]1 \nApplicant is raising this issue for the first time on appeal, and there is no evidence in the \nrecord of the purported statements of the investigator. Applicant frames this issue as an error by \nthe Judge in making findings of fact. We fail to see how the Judge could err in making findings \nabout the purported statements when there is no evidence about them in the record. Under this \ntheory, the purported statements constitute new evidence on appeal that the Appeal Board is \nprohibited from considering. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. Raised in this manner, this issue fails for a lack \nof supporting record evidence to challenge any of the Judge\u2019s findings.   \nThe Appeal Board has previously considered new evidence insofar as it bears upon the \nthreshold questions of due process or jurisdiction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01472 at 2 (App. \nBd. Aug. 6, 2018). Even if we construe this issue as a possible due process violation and consider \nthe investigator\u2019s purported statements, we still conclude no relief is merited. In the SOR, \nApplicant was advised, \u201cBecause this office [the Consolidated Adjudications Facility of the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency] is unable to find that it is clearly consistent \nwith national interest to grant you access to classified information, your case will be submitted to \nan Administrative Judge for a determination as to whether or not to grant, deny, or revoke your \nsecurity clearance.\u201d The SOR was signed by a Division Lead in that office. In essence, the SOR \ninformed Applicant that security clearance adjudicators could not make a favorable clearance \ndecision due to his drug involvement while he held a security clearance. It is reasonable to \nconclude the SOR would have immediately dispelled any misconception that Applicant was \nlaboring under based on the purported statements of the investigator. Put differently, despite \nwhatever the investigator may have said to him, the SOR clearly placed Applicant on notice his \nsecurity clearance was in jeopardy at the time he made his forum selection. \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel presented arguments why Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance should be denied or revoked. Specifically, Department Counsel stated, \u201cApplicant\u2019s \nrepeated use of marijuana after being granted access to classified information evidences a willful \ndisregard for complying with laws, rules, and regulations, and his behavior casts doubt on his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d FORM at 2-3. Again, these arguments unquestionably \nplaced Applicant on notice his security clearance was in jeopardy. The FORM also clearly advised \nApplicant that he could object to the summary of the interview and then \u201cthe document may not \nbe considered as evidence.\u201d FORM at 2 (emphasis in original). Even after being apprised of the \nGovernment\u2019s arguments against the granting of his security clearance in the FORM, Applicant \ndid not request to change his forum selection to a hearing or object to the Judge considering the \nsummary of his background interview.  \nApplicant\u2019s arguments about the impact on him of the investigator\u2019s purported statements \nare not convincing. The record supports a conclusion that Applicant should have been well aware \n1 At the outset, it should be noted the Appeal Board is not convinced that the investigator\u2019s purported statements can \nbe reasonably interpreted as \u201cassurances\u201d that Applicant would retain his security clearance. \n3 \n\n \nWeighing of the Evidence \n \n \nCredibility Determination \n \nHearing-Level Decisions \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof the potential consequences of his decisions regarding this adjudication before he made them.  \nHis arguments fail to establish he was denied any due process afforded him under the Directive.  \nApplicant claims the Judge erred in finding he used marijuana with his wife while they \nwere on trips. In support of this challenge, Applicant brief contains a signed declaration from his \nwife. As noted above, the Appeal Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal, which includes \nthe wife\u2019s declaration. The summary of Applicant\u2019s background interview reflects that he \npurchased marijuana on four trips to two states where he did not reside. It further states, \u201cOn all \nfour of these instances, Subject was traveling with his wife and he smoked marijuana utilizing a \npipe. Afterwards, they would go and explore the city on foot, go out for dinner, and go back to \nthe hotel.\u201d FORM Item 3 at 1. In the findings of fact, the Judge found, \u201cThe details of Applicant\u2019s \nadmitted use of marijuana are that he and his wife traveled to two states in which marijuana could \nbe legally purchased under the laws of those states and used marijuana a total of four times.\u201d \nDecision at 2-3. Applicant does not challenge that finding. Instead, he challenges the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion in the analysis section of the decision, that states, \u201c[Applicant] used the drug with his \nwife while relaxing on a trip . . .\u201d  Decision at 5. \nWhile there are significant differences between the review standards for findings of fact \nand conclusions (compare Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.1 and E3.1.32.3), such distinctions are not critical \nto our analysis here. Based on our review of the record, Applicant cited no errors in the Judge\u2019s \nfindings or conclusions that are likely to affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s brief relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline H cases to argue \nthe Judge erred in his analysis of this case. His reliance on those hearing-level decisions is \nmisplaced. As the Board has previously stated, how particular fact scenarios in other cases were \ndecided at the hearing level are generally not a relevant consideration in our review of a case. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021), setting forth a lengthier discussion \nof this issue. In short, Applicant\u2019s arguments based on favorable hearing-level decisions in cases \ninvolving different applicants and different facts do not establish that the Judge\u2019s conclusions and \nanalysis in this case are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in his credibility determination. In this regard, the \nJudge concluded that Applicant\u2019s change in the date of his last marijuana use was not credible. \nThe Appeal Board is required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments set forth any persuasive reason why we should not \ngive deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determination in this case. \n4 \n\n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, Applicant contends the Judge improperly assessed and weighed the \nevidence. He argues, for example, that his drug involvement was infrequent and not recent, he \nself-reported his marijuana use, and he has acknowledged his mistake. His arguments are neither \nsufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor \nenough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe SOR contains nine Guideline F allegations.

The last allegation was cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. In responding to the SOR, Applicant denied the fraud allegation and admitted the \nother Guideline F allegations. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the state tax allegations \nand against her on the others. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that were not presented to the \nJudge for consideration. Those documents and assertions constitute new evidence that the Appeal \nBoard is prohibited from receiving or considering.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant contends the cross-alleged fraud allegation lacks basis because she was \nunemployed during the period in question, which entitled her to unemployment benefits. During \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding, a state agency filed a complaint against her \nchallenging the dischargeability of a debt. File of Relevant Material (FORM) Item 6 at 3 \n(bankruptcy docket) and Item 12 (Complaint to Determine Dischargebility of a Debt). The \ncomplaint alleged that, while receiving unemployment benefits, Applicant made representations \nthat she remained unemployed or underemployed and was entitled to receive those benefits when \nshe knew those representations were false and made with the intent to deceive. FORM Item 12 at \n3. The complaint identifies the name of Applicant\u2019s employer and the dates of her employment \nwhen she was receiving unemployment benefits. In response to this complaint, the Bankruptcy \nCourt entered a judgment against Applicant in total amount of $14,770, including interest and fees. \nFORM Item 11 at 1. Based on our review of the record, there is substantial evidence to support \nthe Judge\u2019s adverse findings against Applicant on the cross-alleged fraud allegation. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence. However, none of her arguments are sufficient to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is in his early sixties. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982 and has held a security clearance for more than 35 years. Applicant has a history of marijuana use: from about 1978 to 1982 while he was in college; once in December 2001 to January 2002 while he held a security clearance; and again in 2017 and 2018, while holding a security clearance. His marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession resulted in several charges. He was cited in 1979 for possession of marijuana; in January 2002 for possession of drug paraphernalia; in September 2017 for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia; and in January 2018 for possession of drug paraphernalia. In September 1989, Applicant made a statement during his background investigation in which he discussed his 1979 citation for possession of marijuana, admitted that he possessed marijuana in 1979, and stated that he smoked marijuana two to three times from April or May 1979 until the June 1979 arrest. He falsely stated that he had not used marijuana after the arrest in June 1979. In January 2002, Applicant was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia. He denies that he possessed drug paraphernalia, asserting instead that it was a tobacco pipe and that he was found not guilty of the charge.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 23, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On October 4, 2022, after the hearing, DOHA \nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from about 1978 to at \nleast December 2017, to include after he was granted access to sensitive material in 2004; that he \nwas cited for possession of marijuana or drug paraphernalia in 1979, 2002, 2017, and 2018; and \nthat he purchased marijuana in 2017. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified \ninformation during a 2018 security clearance interview regarding both use of marijuana and \npossession of drug paraphernalia and that Applicant was terminated by his previous employer in \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n2015 for unauthorized use of a company-issued credit card. The Judge found adversely to \nApplicant on all allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that Department Counsel exhibited bias towards him, that the \nJudge relied on evidence that was not admitted, and that none of his citations for possession of \nmarijuana and paraphernalia resulted in convictions.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his early sixties. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982 and has held a \nsecurity clearance for more than 35 years. \nApplicant has a history of marijuana use: from about 1978 to 1982 while he was in college; \nonce in December 2001 to January 2002 while he held a security clearance; and again in 2017 and \n2018, while holding a security clearance. His marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession resulted \nin several charges. He was cited in 1979 for possession of marijuana; in January 2002 for \npossession of drug paraphernalia; in September 2017 for possession of marijuana and drug \nparaphernalia; and in January 2018 for possession of drug paraphernalia. \nIn September 1989, Applicant made a statement during his background investigation in \nwhich he discussed his 1979 citation for possession of marijuana, admitted that he possessed \nmarijuana in 1979, and stated that he smoked marijuana two to three times from April or May 1979 \nuntil the June 1979 arrest. He falsely stated that he had not used marijuana after the arrest in June \n1979. \nIn January 2002, Applicant was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia. He denies that \nhe possessed drug paraphernalia, asserting instead that it was a tobacco pipe and that he was found \nnot guilty of the charge. \nIn May 2002, Applicant signed a statement in which he admitted his marijuana use from \n1978 to 1982 while attending college. He also admitted to using marijuana on one occasion in \nDecember 2001 or January 2002, while employed by a defense contractor and holding a security \nclearance. In March 2005, he signed another statement with essentially the same facts. At hearing, \nhowever, Applicant testified that he did not recall using marijuana in 2001 to 2002. \u201cI did not find \nhis testimony credible. I find by substantial evidence that he used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance in about December 2001 or January 2002.\u201d  Decision at 2. \nIn September 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in which \nhe reported his 1979 citation for possession of marijuana, but not his January 2002 citation for \npossession of paraphernalia. He denied that he had ever illegally used or otherwise been involved \nwith a controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. \nIn September 2017, Applicant was stopped for a traffic citation. As events unfolded, the \ndeputy saw a pipe in the passenger compartment and found plastic bags containing just over two \ngrams of marijuana. Applicant admitted to smoking marijuana earlier that day. He was cited with \npossession and received a deferred adjudication after completing requirements for diversion. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBecause Applicant held a security clearance at the time, he reported the charge and its disposition \nto his security officer in November 2017. \nIn January 2018, Applicant was going through airport security, and a small knife and a pipe \nwith marijuana residue were detected in his carry-on bag. Applicant admitted to an airport police \nofficer that the carry-on bag and pipe were his. He stated that he had forgotten that the pipe was in \nhis bag and initially asserted that it was for smoking tobacco. After the officer determined that the \nresidue was marijuana, Applicant admitted that he smoked marijuana and had most recently \nsmoked the previous month on Christmas. \nApplicant was cited with possession of drug \nparaphernalia but was found not guilty of the charge in April 2019. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he borrowed the carry-on bag from his son and that he \nwas unaware that the pipe was in the bag. He denied telling the police officer that he used the \npipe to smoke marijuana. \u201cI did not find his testimony credible. I find that the incident happened \nsubstantially as reported in the police report of the incident.\u201d  Decision at 4. \nIn October 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator about the 2017 \nand 2018 citations and his marijuana use. He admitted that he used marijuana in college from \n1978 to 1983 but stated that he did not use it again until he possessed and used marijuana in July \n2017. In discussing his September 2017 charge for marijuana possession, Applicant admitted that \nhe used marijuana three or four days while he was on vacation in July 2017 and again in September \n2017. He stated those were the only times he used drugs while holding a security clearance. \nDuring his October 2018 interview, Applicant also discussed the January 2018 citation \nfrom the airport. He stated that the pipe was not his, that he did not know how it got in his bag, \nand that it could belong to one of his children. \nAt hearing and in response to the SOR, Applicant denied that he provided false information \nduring the interview (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) and stated again that it was not his pipe that was found \nat the airport. \u201cAs indicated above, I did not find him credible. I find that he lied to the investigator, \nand he provided additional false statements in the SOR response and during his hearing testimony.\u201d \nId. \nApplicant has a history of employment issues concerning unauthorized use of company-\nissued credit cards. In February 1997, his employer reported that Applicant violated company \npolicy by using his credit card for personal use and failing to pay in a timely manner. Later that \nyear, Applicant went to work for another defense contractor. In 2001, that employer counseled \nApplicant for charging personal rental cars to the company\u2019s corporate credit card, for having an \nunpaid balance on a corporate credit card, and for not repaying a cash advance from the company. \nApplicant was suspended without pay for a week, placed on permanent probation, and warned that \nfurther violations would result in termination. In May 2015, Applicant was fired for continued \nmisuse of a company credit card. \nApplicant asserted that he misunderstood company policy, that he never falsified trip \nreports, and that he paid the balance of the credit card. Applicant submitted documents and letters \nattesting to his excellent job performance and ethical standards. He is praised for his work ethic \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nand sensitive handling of classified information. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis. The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below in pertinent part. \nGuideline H \nThere is no evidence of any illegal drug use after January 2018. There are \nno bright-line rules for when conduct is recent. All of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use \nmight be mitigated if I had found him credible, but I did not. His conduct continues \nto cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating \nconditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns. \n[Decision at 7.] \nGuideline E \nAs a preface, I accept the police report as to what occurred in the airport in \nJanuary 2018, that Applicant admitted that he smoked marijuana, and that the last \ntime he smoked marijuana with the pipe was the previous month on Christmas. I \nalso find that Applicant intentionally provided false information during his \nbackground interview in October 2018 when he stated that the pipe was not his; he \ndid not know how it got in his bag; and he had not used marijuana since September \n2017. \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant denied that he lied during his background interview. Having \ndetermined that he intentionally provided false information about his drug use \nin an attempt to mislead the government, I have also determined that his testimony \nat the hearing was also false. It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated \n(internal citation omitted). \nAs to the termination in May 2015 for misuse of a company credit card. Had \nthat been the only incident, it would likely be mitigated. However, he engaged in \nsimilar conduct at a different company in 1997, and in 2001 at the same company \nthat terminated him. That company placed him \u201con permanent probation for any \nsimilar violations,\u201d with the warning that \u201c[s]hould similar violations occur he will \nbe immediately terminated.\u201d That history, coupled with the fact that his testimony \ncannot be trusted, prevents mitigation. [Decision at 9\u201310.) \nDiscussion \nWe turn first to Applicant\u2019s assertion of bias. In his appeal brief, Applicant highlights that \nDepartment Counsel inquired into military service, despite the fact that he had Applicant\u2019s records \nand security clearance application, which indicated no military service. \u201cI did not understand why \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI was asked that question, unless that could set a bias with my not serving in the military.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 2.  \nDOHA proceedings are adversarial in nature. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 9 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005). Department Counsel represent the Government\u2019s interests in these \nproceedings and are not required to be neutral, impartial, or unbiased. In performing their \nprofessional responsibilities, Department Counsel are expected to advocate in a manner that is \ncontrary to an applicant\u2019s positions or interests. A claim of bias against a Department Counsel is \nnot an appealable issue. \nTo the extent that Applicant is claiming Department Counsel acted in an unfair or \ninappropriate manner, there is a rebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry \nout their duties in good faith. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001). A \nparty seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. Department \nCounsel began his cross-examination with a series of background questions to establish \nApplicant\u2019s age, educational background, marital status, and employment history. In the course \nof that colloquy, Department Counsel asked one question to confirm that Applicant had no military \nservice. Tr. at 17. When Applicant confirmed the same, Department Counsel immediately moved \non to the next question. Applicant fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or \nsuggests a basis for a reasonable person to conclude that Department Counsel acted improperly, \nunfairly or unprofessionally. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-26704 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008). \nThis assignment of error is frivolous. \nWe turn next to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge improperly considered evidence that \nwas not admitted. Applicant asserts that the Judge should not consider his answer to the SOR, as \nthe Government did not include it on the list of Government exhibits, did not seek its admission, \nand did not give him notice that it would be considered. Appeal Brief at 2, 3, and 5; Tr. at 27\u201328. \nWe note that Department Counsel\u2019s letter to Applicant of October 5, 2021, explained that the Judge \nwould be provided the SOR and Applicant\u2019s answer prior to the hearing. HE 1 at 2. Additionally, \nas a preliminary matter at hearing, the Judge explained that he had before him the SOR and \nApplicant\u2019s response, \u201cwith a lot of documentary evidence . . . that went along with that.\u201d Tr. at \n7. Applicant was provided ample notice that the Judge would appropriately consider his answer \nto the SOR as part of the record. Our review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with \nthe procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive. \nApplicant also complains that Department Counsel was permitted to inquire into matters \ncontained in GE 5\u2014the unauthenticated summary of Applicant\u2019s 2010 and 2011 interviews\u2014 \ndespite the Judge having sustained his objection to the document. Although GE 5 was not admitted \nas substantive evidence, Department Counsel was nevertheless entitled to inquire into the matters \ndiscussed during that interview, notably Applicant\u2019s citation in January 2002 for possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. This SOR allegation was also independently established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmission in his answer to the SOR that he received the citation. Answer to SOR at 1. In a related \nmatter, Applicant made written statements in May 2002 and again in March 2005 in which he \nadmitted that he used marijuana on one occasion in December 2001 or January 2002. The Judge \nrelied upon these properly admitted statements, GE 6 and GE 7, in concluding that Applicant \u201cused \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance in about December 2001 or January 2002.\u201d Decision \nat 2. Our review of the record and decision establishes that the Judge did not consider or rely upon \nGE 5 in his findings or conclusions. \nFinally, Applicant argues that none of his citations for possession of marijuana or drug \nparaphernalia resulted in convictions. The standard of proof in DOHA proceedings is not proof \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, but instead is substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as \na reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive E3.1.32.1. \u201cEven if criminal charges are reduced, \ndropped, or result in an acquittal, the Judge may still consider the underlying conduct in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00506 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, \n2018). The Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions under Guideline H that Applicant possessed marijuana \nand possessed drug paraphernalia were based on substantial evidence and were well within his \nauthority under the Directive. Moreover, we note the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination \nand defer to it. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. In arriving at his adverse determination, the Judge concluded \nthat Applicant lied at multiple junctures during the security clearance process, to include in \nbackground interviews, to his security officer, in his SOR response, and at hearing. Decision at 2, \n3, and 4. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). See also, Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \n\u00b6 2(b): \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Judge\u2019s adverse findings are affirmed. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

    "summary": "findings of fact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. 1 Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged fifteen delinquent debts, for such things as a student loan, medical expenses, cell phone services, etc., totaling over $26,000. In addition, the SOR alleged delinquent income tax obligations to both the IRS and Applicant\u2019s state of residence. Applicant admitted all of the debts in his Answer to the SOR. Applicant attributed his financial problems to a period of unemployment, lack of health insurance, a contentious personal relationship, and the Covid-19 pandemic. The Judge noted circumstances that were outside Applicant\u2019s control that affected his difficulties, and she resolved three allegations in his favor. For the remaining ones, however, she concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action in regard to his debts or otherwise presented evidence sufficient to mitigate the concerns which they raise. The Guideline E allegations describe numerous instances of wrongful conduct, much of it apparently criminal. These allegations include an Other Than Honorable Discharge from the military due to absence without leave, resisting an officer, theft, multiple instances of domestic abuse, and ten arrests between 2000 and 2017 for driving without a license. Applicant admitted all but one of the Guideline E concerns. The Judge also noted evidence of misconduct that was not alleged: two inst",

Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged fifteen delinquent debts, for such things as a student \nloan, medical expenses, cell phone services, etc., totaling over $26,000. In addition, the SOR \nalleged delinquent income tax obligations to both the IRS and Applicant\u2019s state of residence. \nApplicant admitted all of the debts in his Answer to the SOR. Applicant attributed his financial \nproblems to a period of unemployment, lack of health insurance, a contentious personal \nrelationship, and the Covid-19 pandemic. The Judge noted circumstances that were outside \nApplicant\u2019s control that affected his difficulties, and she resolved three allegations in his favor. \nFor the remaining ones, however, she concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible \naction in regard to his debts or otherwise presented evidence sufficient to mitigate the concerns \nwhich they raise. \nThe Guideline E allegations describe numerous instances of wrongful conduct, much of it \napparently criminal. These allegations include an Other Than Honorable Discharge from the \nmilitary due to absence without leave, resisting an officer, theft, multiple instances of domestic \nabuse, and ten arrests between 2000 and 2017 for driving without a license. Applicant admitted \nall but one of the Guideline E concerns. The Judge also noted evidence of misconduct that was not \nalleged: two instances of driving away without paying for gasoline, an instance of theft of about \n$1,200 dating to the late 1990s, and an instance of bail jumping. The Judge noted evidence of \nseven additional arrests for driving without a license, the latest occurring in 2020. The Judge \naddressed the non-alleged conduct solely in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. She \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s misconduct, viewed as a cumulative whole, established a pattern of \nrule violations that, given its frequency and recency, precludes a conclusion that it is unlikely to \nrecur. Though noting that Applicant has attended counseling for his problems, she held that he \nhad not presented sufficient evidence that he has put his misconduct behind him. \nApplicant contends that \u201c[t]here is no record of [Applicant] admitting to the allegations \nunder Guideline E, so they should be considered summarily denied[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. In fact, \nApplicant\u2019s SOR Answer includes admissions to all but one of these allegations, as the Judge \nfound. On its face, this argument is without merit. To the extent that it implicitly challenges the \nsufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings under Guideline E, we conclude that these findings are \nsupported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u204b E3.1.32.1. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s brief constitutes, in effect, a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence. We have considered these arguments in light of the totality of the record. \nWe note, among other things, his argument that his most recent Guideline E allegation pertained \nto conduct more than five years old. However, Applicant admitted at the hearing to more recent \ninstances of misconduct, which the Judge properly took into account in performing her mitigation \nanalysis.  After considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s arguments, we conclude that Applicant has \nnot rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or \ndemonstrated that she weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 18-00166 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2018). Moreover, we conclude \nthat the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3, in that \nshe considered the totality of the evidence in reaching her decision. Id. Applicant has submitted \nsome Hearing Office cases in support of his appeal. We give due consideration to these cases.  \nHowever, each case must be decided upon its own merits.

On \nJuly 26, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive).

Wesley \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant raised the following issues: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse \ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law due to errors in applying the mitigating \nconditions and whole-person concept.

He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since 2006 and was granted a security clearance in late 2011. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 1991 to late \n2018, including while holding a security clearance, and that he falsified responses in security \nclearance applications (SCAs) in 2011 and 2017 by failing to disclose his use of marijuana. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged marijuana use, but \u201cclaimed to have \nincorrectly omitted his use of marijuana in both [SCAs.]\u201d Decision at 2. The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on the three allegations. \nApplicant began using marijuana in high school, used it about three times a month in \ncollege, ceased using it for a number of years, and again used it once or twice a month from 2007 \nto 2018. He used it to reduce anxiety and relieve upset stomach symptoms, and typically smoked \nit with his spouse or a friend. He was aware that his use of marijuana violated DoD regulations. \nIn late 2018, he ceased using it due to concerns about the safety of his children. Between 2019 \nand 2022, he took voluntary drug tests that had negative results. After referring himself to \nsubstance abuse counseling in 2019, a counselor determined he did not meet the criteria for a \nsubstance use disorder and entered \u201cno diagnosis\u201d as formal diagnostic impressions in the \ncategories of behavioral, medical, and psychological. Decision at 4. \u201cApplicant has committed \nto abandoning all involvement with marijuana\u201d and \u201cexhibits no visible signs or indications of \n[returning] to illegal drug use in the foreseeable future.\u201d Decision at 8. However, given his 27\u00ad\nyear history of marijuana use and \u201chis persistent withholding of information about his involvement \nwith the drug, it is still too soon to absolve Applicant of risks of recurrence.\u201d Id. \nApplicant\u2019s omissions of his marijuana use on his 2011 and 2017 SCAs \u201cwere made \nknowingly and willfully and reflected a lack of candor.\u201d Decision at 4. When asked during a \n2018 background interview if he had any illegal drug involvement in the last seven years, \nApplicant initially told the investigator he had not, but later in the interview disclosed his past drug \nuse without any prodding. \u201cHe acknowledged in his hearing testimony that he could have come \nclean about his past marijuana use much earlier when he completed his [SCAs], but did not.\u201d \nDecision at 4, citing Tr. at 49-50. \nIn the face of proven acts of falsification by Applicant over a seven-year \nperiod spanning two [SCAs] and an initial [background interview] before opening \nup about his marijuana use, his disclosures, although voluntary when offered, come \ntoo late to meet the mitigating requirements of [Mitigating Condition] \u00b6 17(a). His \nlaudatory endorsements from coworkers, friends, and family members, while \ncommendable, are not enough to counter his material omissions of his past \nmarijuana use.

On the other hand, \nthe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s \u201cpersistent withholding of information about his involvement with the \ndrug\u201d in his Guideline H analysis, which was an appropriate factor for him to consider in \ndetermining how much weight should be given to Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding his intention to \ncease using marijuana in the future. Concerning the falsification allegations, Applicant argues \nthat he voluntarily corrected his SCA during his background investigation and his latest omission \noccurred almost four years ago. He further notes the Judge stated that \u201che has shown marked \nimprovement in his judgment and maturity level in the three-plus years that he has avoided \nmarijuana use.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8, quoting from Decision at 8. Applicant\u2019s arguments are not \npersuasive. \nWe find no error in the Judge\u2019s analysis. The presence of some mitigating evidence does \nnot alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision. As the trier of fact, \nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence \noutweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not \nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that \nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMar. 31, 2020). \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). See also, Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b): \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n1 Applicant\u2019s brief cites to outdated mitigating conditions. The Appeal Board must apply the current version of the \nadjudicative guidelines. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01193 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2019). The current version of \nthe adjudicative guidelines (Senior Executive Agency Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, \neffective June 8, 2017) is reprinted in Enclosure 2 of the current version of the Directive.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn September 9, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

The adverse findings pertained to a 2011 discharge in bankruptcy; failure to file a Federal \nincome tax return for tax year 2016; debts to the IRS for delinquent income taxes for tax years \n2015 and 2018; and three consumer debts totaling about $3,400. The Judge found that Applicant \nhad been denied a security clearance in 2016 due to delinquent debts. Applicant attributed the \nfinancial problems alleged in his current SOR to a divorce. Documentary evidence supplied by \nApplicant showed that he owed about $4,500 for tax year 2018; about $5,600 for tax year 2016, \nwhich was not alleged in the SOR; and about $6,300 for tax year 2015. Applicant did not begin \nto address his IRS problems until 2018. As of the month following the hearing, Applicant\u2019s IRS \ndebts were still unresolved. The Judge stated that she would consider non-alleged conduct solely \nin evaluating Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, his credibility, and in performing a whole-person \nanalysis. She found that one of the remaining debts was resolved through wage garnishment and \nthat he had not provided evidence to substantiate his claims about resolving some debts. \nThe Judge characterized Applicant\u2019s debts as ongoing, stating that his financial condition \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She noted the timing \nof Applicant\u2019s efforts at resolving his tax problems, concluding that he did not demonstrate that \nhe had acted responsibly in regard to them. She noted that Applicant did not provide evidence of \nan existing payment plan with the IRS and that he has not had financial counseling. The Judge \nconcluded that after considering the entirety of the record, she was left with questions and doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nDiscussion \nIn his Appeal Brief, Applicant states the following: \nThis application started in 2017 and has continued through 2022. This is a long \ntime lapse to judge someone on their financial issues from 2011 to 2018.  I believe \nthe court should have only allowed current financial concerns. If I was judged on \nmy current financial situation, the only negative findings would be that I owe back \ntaxes which I\u2019m on an installment plan to repay with the IRS.  [Appeal Brief at 1.] \nWe construe this argument as contending that the Judge did not properly perform a whole-person \nanalysis, devoting too much attention to conduct that began over ten years ago and devoting too \nlittle to his current financial condition. \nThe concern under Guideline F is that failure to \u201cmeet financial obligations may indicate \npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18.  The Directive requires that, \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s security eligibility, the Government examine \u201ca sufficient period of \ntime . . . to make an affirmative determination that the individual is an acceptable security risk.\u201d \nId. at \u00b6 2(a). To that end, a Judge should take into account all aspects of the record evidence \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbearing upon the applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \nWe note that the Judge found that many of Applicant\u2019s debts had been resolved, and she \nentered favorable conclusions regarding them. However, her findings that Applicant\u2019s IRS debts \nremain owing and that he did not corroborate his claims to be paying them off are consistent with \nthe record that was before her, undercutting Applicant\u2019s appeal argument that his current financial \ncondition is demonstrably stable. Moreover, even though several of Applicant\u2019s debts have been \nresolved, the Judge was still authorized to consider the underlying circumstances of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems in determining whether he had mitigated the concerns set forth in the SOR. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2019) (Even if an applicant has actually \npaid his debts, or they have been removed through a legal process such as bankruptcy, a Judge \nmay still consider the circumstances underlying the debts for what they may reveal about the \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance). That Applicant has had financial problems for many years; \nthat he had previously been denied a clearance because of Guideline F concerns, which should \nhave placed him on notice of the importance of financial stability to his eligibility for a clearance; \nand that several of his debts\u2014including those owed to the IRS\u2014were still owing as of the close \nof the record support her overall analysis. Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s whole-\nperson analysis was deficient. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments consists, in effect, of a disagreement with the \nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. These arguments are not enough to show that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law nor to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n21-00734 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 2, 2022). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Tr. at 71-72 and 77\u00ad\n78. In his decision, the Judge noted Applicant did not submit any additional matters. In his \nappeal brief, Applicant contended that he submitted matters on May 20, 2021; he forwarded with \nhis appeal approximately nine documents that he asserted had been emailed to the Judge. \nFollowing our review of the record, we determined that the documents submitted on appeal \nsupported Applicant\u2019s claim that he submitted matters the Judge did not receive. On September, \n2021, we remanded the case to the Judge to reopen the record to provide Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional evidence. \nUpon remand, the Judge searched his email account and found the email sent by Applicant \non May 20, 2021, with attachments. By email of September 25, 2021, the Judge notified \nApplicant that he would consider the additional evidence submitted on May 20, 2021, and gave \nApplicant until October 1, 2021, to submit any additional materials for consideration. The Judge \ndid not receive any additional documents and admitted six documents that were attached to \nApplicant\u2019s email of May 20, 2021. On October 14, 2021, he issued his Decision on Remand, \nagain denying Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. He asserts that he did not receive the Judge\u2019s email of \nSeptember 25, 2021, that he was unaware of the opportunity to submit additional evidence, and \nthat the Judge did not consider all the evidence submitted on May 20, 2021. \nAlthough we are generally precluded from considering new material, we will consider new \nevidence insofar as it bears upon questions of due process or jurisdiction. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01472 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018). In resolving cases in which applicants claim to have \nsubmitted documents that were not received, we generally examine the record and the briefs to see \nwhether there is any support for this claim. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03712 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJan. 11, 2018). In both appeals, Applicant has submitted nine documents that he asserts were \nsubmitted to the Judge by email of May 20, 2021: those documents include three letters of \nreference, two photographs, pages from his response to interrogatories, a certificate of completion \nof an anger management course, a document showing completion of an alcohol safety program, \nand a certificate of his child\u2019s dedication ceremony. Upon remand, the Judge admitted six \ndocuments, one of which is a duplicate. Said differently, Applicant asserts that four documents \nhe submitted were not considered. The record tends to support Applicant\u2019s claim that he \nsubmitted matters the Judge did not consider. \nBased on the above, we conclude the best course of action is to again remand the case to \nthe Judge to reopen the record to ensure all of the post-hearing exhibits are included in the record \nand to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. As provided in Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.35, the Judge shall, upon remand, issue a new decision in the case. The Board retains no \ncontinuing jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a decision issued after remand may \nbe appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. to E3.1.35.

The Judge\u2019s favorable findings were not raised \nas an issue on appeal. \nIn his latest appeal, Applicant raised the following issues: whether delays in the processing \nof the case caused unnecessary stress, whether he was denied due process, and whether the adverse \ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For the reasons stated below, the Judge\u2019s \ndecision is affirmed. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified responses in two security \nclearance applications (SCAs). In a 2007 SCA, Applicant was asked whether he used marijuana \nsince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to that question \nand was granted a security clearance shortly thereafter. Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 23 and GE \n2 at 28. In a 2017 SCA, he responded \u201cNo\u201d to a question that asked whether he ever illegally \nused a controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. GE 2 at 26. In the decision, \nthe Judge found that Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana in 2009, \n2010, and 2011 and that \u201cApplicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social \nsettings in 2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He testified \nhe stopped using it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized it could \njeopardize his job.\u201d Decision at 4. In his whole-person analysis, the Judge concluded: \nApplicant offered considerable evidence in mitigation, but it is offset by his \nyears of deceptive conduct. He used marijuana for many years while holding a \nsecurity clearance, but he did not disclose his drug-related arrests to his employer. \nHe lied about his drug involvement in his February 2007 SCA and again in his \nFebruary 2017 SCA. He lied to a security investigator in September 2018, until \nthe investigator confronted him with his arrest record. Even after admitting his \ndrug involvement to the investigator, he gave inconsistent and implausible \nexplanations for his false answers in his SCA. He eventually admitted at the \nhearing that he did not disclose his drug involvement because he was afraid it might \njeopardize his clearance or his job.1 [Decision at 13.] \nApplicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. Rather, his brief contains \narguments challenging the Judge\u2019s analysis of the evidence. For example, Applicant argues the \nJudge did not consider the time that has elapsed since his falsifications. The Board has not \nestablished \"bright-line\" guidance regarding the concept of recency. \nInstead, a recency \ndetermination must be made based on careful consideration of the totality of the specific record at \nhand. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0018 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2000). Based on the record \nevidence in this case, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he was not convinced that \n\u201cApplicant has put his long record of concealment and deception behind him.\u201d Decision at 13. \n1 Some of this conduct, such as lying to the investigator, was not alleged in the SOR. In the decision, the Judge noted \nnon-alleged conduct could be considered to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility, to evaluate evidence in extenuation, \nmitigation, and changed circumstances, to consider whether an applicant demonstrated successful rehabilitation, and \nin conducting a whole-person analysis.

None \nof his arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record or to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. \n9, 2017). \nApplicant argues \u201cmiscommunications [between him and the Judge] has cause[d] this case \nto be prolonged and has caused unnecessary stress . . . .\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. Absent a showing \nof prejudice to an applicant's rights, the mere passage of time in the processing of a case does not \nconstitute error that warrants any form of corrective action. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001). We recognize that security clearance adjudications can be stressful \nfor applicants, and a mere claim of \u201cunnecessary stress\u201d resulting from previous remands is \ninsufficient to establish prejudice meriting relief. Applicant fails to articulate any plausible \nargument about how his rights were prejudiced because the adjudication was prolonged due to the \nremands. \nIn his brief, Applicant describes the Judge\u2019s comments and actions regarding his post-\nhearing submissions as \u201cdeceiving.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. To the extent he is contending that his \nsecurity clearance adjudication was unfair or that the Judge engaged in misconduct or lacked \nimpartiality, we do not find that argument persuasive. From our review of the record, there is no \nbasis to conclude that the Judge did anything improper. Applicant failed to rebut the presumption \nthat a Judge was impartial, failed to establish his proceeding was conducted in an unfair manner, \nand failed to show he was denied due process. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJan. 30, 2020). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

On \nJuly 12, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations. \nUpon motion of Department Counsel prior to the hearing, the Judge permitted amendment \nof the SOR. As amended, SOR \u00b6 1.b. alleged that Applicant failed to timely pay his federal income \ntaxes between 2013 and 2018, and SOR \u00b6 1.c. alleged that Applicant owed $28,451 for unpaid \ntaxes from tax years 2014 through 2018.  As amended, Applicant denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. \nApplicant is in his mid-fifties. Since 2003, he has worked for a defense contractor in a \nposition that required him to deploy overseas in support of U.S. operations. In his 2018 security \nclearance application, Applicant disclosed that he filed his federal and state income tax returns late \nfor the 2012, 2013, and 2017 tax years and that he owed an estimated total of $4,100 in unpaid \ntaxes. Available information established that Applicant filed his federal returns late for tax years \n2013 through 2020. Additionally, the background investigation revealed that, in March 2019, \nApplicant resolved a $34,391 debt for unpaid state taxes for the 2013 through 2016 tax years. \nIn July 2015, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS under which he \ninitially paid $151 per month.  Over the years, his monthly payments have increased; he currently \npays $350 per month. At hearing, Applicant\u2019s evidence established that he owed $28,451 for \nunpaid taxes in December 2020 and that he had reduced his total to $19,022 by August 2021, \nhaving satisfied the debts for tax years 2014 and 2015.  \nApplicant attributed his failure to file his 2013 returns to confusion: his pay had increased \nfrom working overseas, he owed additional taxes, and he was unsure about how to file his returns \ngiven the unexpected taxes due. Applicant also claimed that he did not know how to change his \nwithholdings to avoid owing a payment upon filing. It was not until 2016 that Applicant took \naction to file his past-due returns with the help of a commercial tax preparation company. \nSubsequently, a private tax preparer assisted him with his returns for 2018 through 2020. \nApplicant is now current on all of his tax filing obligations, and his withholdings are appropriate \nfor his income. \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are otherwise sound, with no outstanding debt, a robust \nincome, and a healthy investment portfolio. Applicant acknowledged that he has the means to \nresolve his current tax debt, but has chosen not to do so, as he is satisfied with the monthly payment \nplan.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for at least five \nconsecutive tax years. Additionally, he failed to pay his federal taxes for six consecutive years, \namassing a debt for unpaid taxes in excess of $28,000. Although he is current on his tax filing \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nobligations, he still owes about $19,000 in unpaid taxes. Despite having the resources to resolve \nthe debts more quickly, he is unwilling to resolve his tax debts outside of his agreement with the \nIRS. As amended, SOR 1.b. is resolved for Applicant because it is subsumed by the more \ninformative allegation at SOR 1.c.  However, the Government\u2019s information sufficiently supports \nSOR 1.a. and 1.c.  \nWith regard to the mitigating conditions, the Judge concluded, in pertinent part: \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s tax debt remains largely \nunpaid and Applicant chooses not to use the resources he has at hand to more timely \nresolve his tax debts. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because he reached a repayment \nagreement with the IRS in 2015; however, the value of this mitigation is attenuated \nby his continued failure to file and pay his taxes even after he entered into the \nagreement. Applicant has the means to pay this debt now but has chosen not to. At \nthe current $370 monthly rate of repayment, his $19,000 remaining balance will \ntake another 51 months to resolve.  \nAG 20(b) does not apply because Applicant did not show that his failure to file and \npay his taxes as required arose from circumstances beyond his control. Making \nmore money usually means having to pay more taxes. When Applicant was faced \nwith that prospect, he stopped filing his returns. Although he reached an IRS-\napproved agreement in 2015, he did not address the underlying problem until 2017, \nwhen he filed his past-due returns and adjusted his tax withholdings. [Decision at \n6\u20137.] \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, \n2015). \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in determining that he had failed \nto timely file his federal returns for the 2013 through 2020 tax years and that the Judge then relied \nupon that erroneous finding in his analysis. We conclude that Applicant\u2019s argument has merit. \nSpecifically, our review of the record confirms that the Judge erred in the following findings: \na. \u201cAvailable information \u2026 showed that Applicant has been late in filing his federal returns \non time for the 2013 through 2020 tax years.\u201d Decision at 3.   \nb. \u201cIt was not until 2016 that Applicant took action to file his past-due returns with the help \nof a commercial tax preparation company.\u201d   Id. at 4.   \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nc. \u201cInformation obtained by investigators and adjudicators during the ensuing background \ninvestigation showed that in March 2019, he resolved a $34,391 debt for unpaid state taxes \nfor the 2013 through 2016 tax years.\u201d Id. at 3. \nContrary to the Judge\u2019s findings, the record establishes that Applicant filed his federal tax \nreturns on time for tax years 2014, 2018, 2019, and 2020.1 Additionally, the record confirms that \nApplicant did not delay filing until 2016, but instead filed his 2013 return in December 2014 and \nfiled his 2014 return on time in April 2015. Said differently, before Applicant entered into his \nrepayment plan for 2013 and 2014 taxes in July 2015, he had filed the returns for both years.  We \ncannot say these errors are harmless, as the Judge references Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to file \nreturns at least four times in his analysis and whole person evaluation. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s error \nregarding tax years 2018 through 2020 is particularly weighty, as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent tax history and compliance with tax obligations. \nRegarding the Judge\u2019s finding of a large state tax delinquency, our review of the record \nreveals no evidence that Applicant had a $34,391 debt for unpaid state taxes that he resolved in \nMarch 2019. Instead, the evidence establishes that Applicant paid approximately that amount in \nstate taxes for tax years 2013 through 2016, with 2013 taxes apparently paid late, as interest and \npenalties were also paid. GE 2 at 4. Delinquent state taxes were not alleged in the SOR, not \ninquired into at the hearing, and not the primary focus of the Judge\u2019s analysis or decision.  \nNevertheless, the Judge erroneously found that the Applicant had a state tax delinquency greater \nthan his federal tax delinquency, which he resolved in 2019, after adjudication of his clearance \nwas ongoing. We cannot assume this error played no role in the Judge\u2019s analysis or decision and \nwas, therefore, harmless. \nAccordingly, we conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand the case to the \nJudge for correction of these errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive. As \nprovided in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35, the Judge shall, upon remand, issue a new decision in the case. \nOther issues raised in the appeal are not ripe for consideration at this time. The Board retains no \ncontinuing jurisdiction over a remanded case. However, a decision issued after remand may be \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 to E3.1.35. \n1 Of note, the IRS delayed tax filing deadlines for tax years 2019 and 2020 due to COVID-19.

Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. The Judge found against Applicant on \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant is in his mid-fifties. He served on active duty between 1984 and 1993 and retired \nfrom the Reserve in 2017. Since 2003, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor in a position \nthat required him to deploy overseas in support of U.S. operations. His 2018 security clearance \napplication, subsequent investigation, and documents provided by Applicant revealed that he filed \nhis federal income tax returns late for tax years 2013, 2016, and 2017 and that he accrued tax debt \nfor tax years 2014 through 2018 that totaled $28,400 by December 2020.    \nApplicant asserts that he was late in filing some of his federal and state returns starting in \n2013 because he found himself owing additional taxes as a result of increased income from \nworking overseas.  After filing his 2013 returns, he started addressing his filing discrepancies. In \nJuly 2015, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS to make $151 monthly \npayments to resolve his tax debt. That repayment agreement has been renewed and adjusted to \nreflect additional debts for subsequent tax years. His monthly payments were increased with each \nrenewal, first to $191, then to $250, and now to $350 each month. His tax debt has also been \nreduced through diversion of tax refunds.  \nApplicant retained a private tax preparer who helped him file his returns for the 2018, 2019, \nand 2020 tax years. By August 2021, Applicant had satisfied the debts for tax years 2014 and \n2015 and reduced the arrearage to approximately $19,000 in unpaid taxes for tax years 2016, 2017, \nand 2018. Applicant is now current on all of his tax reporting obligations and has adjusted his \nwithholdings to a sufficient level to satisfy his tax obligation. \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are otherwise sound, with no outstanding debt, a take-home \nmonthly income of over $10,000, and a healthy investment portfolio. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he has the means to resolve his current tax debt, but has chosen not to do so, as he is satisfied \nwith the monthly payment plan with the IRS. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013, \n2016, and 2017. He has since brought his filing status current, and the allegation at SOR 1.a. is \nresolved for Applicant.1 However, Applicant incurred a $28,400 debt for federal taxes not timely \n1 The Judge also resolved SOR 1.b. for Applicant \u201cbecause it is subsumed by the more informative allegation at SOR \n1.c.\u201d Decision at 6. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \npaid with his returns for tax years 2014 through 2018, still owes about $19,000 in unpaid taxes and \n\u201cis unwilling to resolve his tax debts more expeditiously outside of his agreement with the IRS \ndespite having the means to do so.\u201d  Decision at 5\u20136. \nAG \u00b6 20(a)2 does not apply because Applicant\u2019s tax debts are multiple and \nrecent, in that they remain largely unpaid. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d)3 and 20(g)4 apply because \nApplicant began using installments starting in 2015 to resolve his unpaid taxes. \nHowever, the benefit of these mitigating conditions is attenuated by the fact that \nApplicant chooses not to use the resources he has at hand to more timely resolve \nhis tax debts. At the current $370 monthly rate of repayment, his $19,000 \nremaining balance will take another 51 months to resolve.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b)5 does not apply because Applicant did not show that his failure \nto pay his taxes as required arose from circumstances beyond his control. Making \nmore money usually means having to pay more taxes. Although he began \nrepayment agreements with the IRS in 2015, and he adjusted his tax withholdings \nin 2017, he has not acted to resolve his tax debt consistent with the financial \nresources at his disposal. As of the close of the record, he still owed past-due taxes \nfrom five years earlier in 2016, yet despite having the means to resolve his tax debts \nalmost immediately, his current intent is to make the IRS wait another four to five \nyears for the rest of the taxes owed. His choice to continue investing his disposable \nincome rather than prioritizing resolution of his tax debt weakens any claim that he \nacted responsibly in the fact of any unforeseen circumstances.  [Decision at 7.] \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2014). \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions. With regard to \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) in particular, Applicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\u2014 \nalthough both mitigating conditions apply\u2014\u201cthe benefit of those mitigating conditions is \nattenuated by the fact that Applicant chooses not to use the resources he has at hand to more timely \nresolve his tax debts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4, quoting Decision at 7.  \n2 AG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n3 AG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n4 AG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed \nand is in compliance with those arrangements. \n5 AG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nHere, [Applicant] established an agreed upon payment plan with the IRS to pay his \ntaxes. At no time since this agreement was established has [Applicant] missed a \npayment. Meaning, he is not overdue to his creditor, and he is acting in good-faith \nto resolve this debt. See AG \u00b6 20(d).  Further, pursuant to AG \u00b6 20(g), [Applicant] \nhas consistently complied with the payment arrangement with the IRS, yet the \n[Judge] fails to credit this simply because of an unreasonable position that \n[Applicant] should devote his financial resources to clearing this debt as opposed \nto using it for other investments. The fact that [Applicant] is current on his payment \narrangement as mutually agreed to with the IRS is all that should matter here, and \nto conclude otherwise is arbitrary and capricious. [Appeal Brief at 4.] \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are of mixed merit. First, we reject the argument that being current \non a payment plan\u2014standing alone\u2014mitigates under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) and resolves all \nsecurity concerns. As with the application of any mitigating condition, the Judge must consider \nall the record evidence and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable, or \nvice versa. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018). The Judge may \nproperly consider the circumstances under which the tax arrearage accrued, whether Applicant \ninitiated good-faith efforts to resolve the problem, the timing of any such efforts, the length of time \nthat Applicant has been on a payment plan, and his degree of compliance with the plan. \nThat said, in the case before us, the Judge concluded that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) \nand AG 20(g) apply. That conclusion is sustainable, as it is consistent with the record that was \nbefore him, which included the following evidence: Applicant initiated a repayment plan with the \nIRS in 2015\u2014three years before he completed the SCA and four years before issuance of the SOR; \nthe payments under the plan increased as the aggregate debt increased; Applicant pays interest \nunder the plan at a rate set by the IRS; Applicant has been in compliance with the plan for seven \nyears; Applicant retained professional assistance and has timely filed since 2018; he has accrued \nno additional arrearage since 2018; and he had paid off approximately 33% of the aggregate debt \nby August 2021. \nHaving found mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and AG 20(g) apply, it is inconsistent for \nthe Judge then to conclude that Applicant nevertheless failed in meeting his burden of persuasion \nas to mitigation. In reaching his adverse determination, the Judge relies solely on Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to pay off the aggregate debt immediately despite having the means to do so. However, the \nJudge cites to no authority for imposing this additional consideration, nor are we familiar with any. \nInstead, the Board has held that the mere fact that it might take Applicant a long time to complete \na payment agreement is not a reason to deny him a clearance. See ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 3\u2013 \n4 (App.Bd. April 4, 2008). To establish a meaningful track record of debt reform, an applicant is \nrequired to demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken \nsignificant actions to implement that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 3. Applicant\u2019s \nsustained compliance with the agreement he reached with the IRS demonstrates a track record of \ndebt resolution and undermines the Judge\u2019s rationale for denying him a clearance under Guideline \nF. Under the facts of this case, the Judge\u2019s decision fails to draw a rational connection between \nhis finding that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and AG 20(g) have been established and his conclusion that Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nhas failed to demonstrate that his security concerns have been mitigated. The Judge\u2019s decision \nruns contrary to the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4. \nEach case must be decided on its own merits. In the one before us, we conclude that the \nJudge\u2019s adverse findings are not sustainable.  \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F.

On \nMay 20, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline E (Personal \nConduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On April 26, 2022, after \nclose of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nElizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence and whether she misapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering \nher adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant was \narrested for simple assault in April 2015 for punching his wife; was terminated from a job in \nNovember 2015 after punching a co-worker; lied to his employer in 2017 on three separate \noccasions; and falsified the answers to four questions on his March 2018 security clearance \napplication (SCA). Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant has family members, all \ncitizens of Iraq, who live in Iraq, the United Arab Emirate (UAE), Egypt, and Turkey. Upon \nGovernment request, the Judge took administrative notice of current political conditions in those \nfour countries. The Judge found for Applicant on all Guideline F allegations, three Guideline E \nallegations, and one Guideline B allegation and found adversely to Applicant on the remaining \nGuideline E and Guideline B allegations. The favorable findings are not raised as an issue on \nappeal. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early forties. Born in Iraq, he married his spouse there in 2004. They \nfled the country in 2006 and ultimately immigrated to the United States as refuges in 2009.  They \nhave two children: one born in Iraq and one in the United States. Both he and his spouse became \nnaturalized citizens in 2014. In 2018, he applied for a DoD security clearance for work as a \ncontract linguist. He served as a translator from January 2019 through October 2021, including \non training missions overseas. During his background investigation, Applicant underwent a \ncounterintelligence security screening (CSS) interview in February 2018 and personal subject \ninterviews (PSIs) in March 2018 and May 2018.  \nGuideline E Allegations \nIn April 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor domestic assault \non his wife (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). The charge was eventually nolle prossed. During his CSS interview, he \nindicated that he had argued with his spouse and was arrested for simple assault for physically \nrestraining her in front of the police. During his March 2018 PSI, Applicant stated that he was \narrested after punching his wife repeatedly in the face and chest. At hearing, he denied both the \nassault and the arrest. \nOn his March 2018 SCA, in regards in each of his listed employments, Applicant answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to the question of whether he was fired; quit after being told he would be fired; left by mutual \nagreement following charges or allegations of misconduct; or left by mutual agreement following \nnotice of unsatisfactory performance (SOR \u00b6 1.h.). In his subsequent March 2018 PSI, Applicant \nreportedly admitted that he left one employment after he punched a co-worker in the face, was \nquestioned by police about the incident, and was advised by the staffing agency that he would not \nbe welcomed back at the job site (SOR \u00b6 2.b.). At hearing, Applicant denied that he punched the \nco-worker and asserted that he simply walked off the job site after an argument. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his May 2018 PSI, Applicant was asked about being reprimanded for absences \nwhile working for a particular employer. Applicant admitted to the background investigator that \nhe had lied to supervisors about the reasons for three different absences (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c. \u2013 2.e.). In \none instance, he told the staffing company that he went to Iraq for the funeral of his brother, who \nhe claimed had died in an explosion. Instead, Applicant needed the time off to pursue another \nemployment opportunity. When asked by the background investigator whether his supervisor was \naware that he lied, Applicant responded negatively, described himself as \u201ca good liar,\u201d and stated \nthat it was okay to tell \u201cwhite lies.\u201d Decision at 9, citing GE at 2. At hearing, Applicant asserted \nthat he won\u2019t make false statements in the future.  \nGuideline B \nApplicant\u2019s family and his wife\u2019s family are all Iraqi citizens. In 2018, he reported the \nfollowing concerning their residences, occupations, and degree of contact with him. Two sisters \nwere housewives in Iraq.  Four sisters lived in the UAE, where one worked outside the home as a \nschoolteacher. One sister was a housewife in Egypt. By social media, he had daily contact with \nthe sister in Egypt, weekly contact with one sister in the UAE, and monthly contact with the \nremaining sisters. Two of his brothers resided in the UAE; neither worked for the government or \nmilitary. Another brother lived in Iraq and was employed by a ministry of the Iraq government \nsince 1994. Via social media, he had weekly contact with his brothers in the UAE and monthly \ncontact with his brother in Iraq. \nHis wife\u2019s parents and sisters are resident citizens of Iraq. His father-in-law worked for \nthe Iraqi government in its police from 1986 until 2005. Her mother and sisters were not employed \noutside the home. Her three brothers were Iraqi citizens living in Turkey. In 2018, he reported \ncontact with his various in-laws that varied from daily to monthly. Between 2010 and 2018, \nApplicant provided financial support to his wife\u2019s parents in Iraq and his sister in Egypt.  \nSince coming to the United States in 2009, Applicant has returned to Iraq for visits in 2014 \nand 2017 and visited family members in the UAE in 2014 and 2019. At hearing, Applicant asserted \nthat he recognized after working as a linguist that ties with his family would affect his job, so he \ncut off contacts.  He denied any contact with his siblings in Iraq since his trip in 2017.  He denied \nany contact since 2019 with his siblings who reside in the UAE and Egypt. Applicant testified that \nhe simply stopped calling them and that they are unaware of the reasons for him doing so. At \nhearing, Applicant also denied any contact with his in-laws in Iraq or Turkey since 2017 and stated \nthat he and his wife no longer provide any financial support. He stated that he does not know when \nhis wife last spoke with her family. \nCharacter and Employment References \nIn June 2020, Applicant received a certificate of appreciation from the squadron that he \nsupported as a linguist. Additionally, U.S. military members of the mission submitted letters \nattesting to his professionalism, dedication, and expertise as a translator. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Analysis \nThe evidence establishes six incidents that raise personal conduct security concerns: \nassaultive behavior against his spouse; assaultive behavior against a former co-worker; three lies \nto his employer in 2017 and 2018 about his reasons for requesting leave and for leaving the job; \nand a misrepresentation on his SCA about the reason for him leaving a particular employment. \nHis characterization of his false statements to his employer as \u201cwhite lies\u201d make it difficult to \nconclude that his current denials that he assaulted his wife and co-worker can be relied on and that \nthe dishonesty he exhibited is unlikely to recur.  \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s siblings or his wife\u2019s family members have engaged \nin any activities contrary to U.S. interests or that they have been targeted or pressured.  However, \nthe risk of terrorism is very real in Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey. Additionally, Turkey is a source and \ntransit country to foreign terrorist fighters seeking to join ISIS and other terrorist groups fighting \nin Syria and Iraq, all four countries involved have significant human rights issues, Egypt has been \nimplicated in recent economic and technological espionage, and U.S. protected technology has \npassed through the UAE to destinations such as Iran and Syria.  \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers works for Iraq\u2019s government. Not enough is known about this \nbrother\u2019s activities or position to allay that concern that his government employment heightens the \nrisk. \u201cThe risk of indiscriminate acts of terrorism and the human rights issues in all four countries \npreclude full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a).\u201d1 Decision at 23. \nApplicant has partially mitigated under AG \u00b6 8(b).2 His desire to continue work as a \nlinguist for the US is consistent with allegiance to his adopted home. Applicant and his spouse are \nnaturalized citizens and own their home in the United States. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 8(c),3 Applicant asks the Government to believe that he ended his contacts \nwith his family and in-laws in 2019 without explaining to his relatives the reasons why. Even if \nthat is true, it is unclear that his spouse has ended her contacts with her family. In light of all the \nfacts and circumstances, the risk of undue foreign influence is not fully mitigated.   \n1 AG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the \npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the United States. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A. \n2 AG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign \nperson, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict \nof interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A. \n3 AG 8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that \nit could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.

Instead, he asserts \nthat the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence and failed to apply the mitigating conditions \nproperly under both Guidelines B and E, rendering her decision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary \nto law. For example, under Guideline B, Applicant asserts that the Judge committed a \u201cclear error\u201d \nin her analysis under AG \u00b6 8(a) in finding that the unknown nature of Appellant\u2019s brother\u2019s position \nwithin the Iraqi government alone precluded full mitigation. Appeal Brief at 15. This argument \nlacks merit. First, the Judge did not rely solely upon the lack of information about the brother\u2019s \nposition, but instead concluded that \u201c[t]he risk of indiscriminate acts of terrorism and the human \nrights issues in all four countries preclude full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a).\u201d Decision at 23. \nSecond, the burden was on Applicant to show the security concerns arising from his brother\u2019s \nposition with the Iraqi government were mitigated. Undoubtedly, the Judge could consider the \nabsence of evidence about the brother\u2019s position in her analysis of this mitigating condition.  \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to consider AG \u00b6 17(c).4 He \nargues that the allegations in question were \u201cminor isolated incidents that the [Department] counsel \ncollected to create a narrative of a deceptive person.\u201d Appeal Brief at 18. Our review of the record \nreveals sufficient evidence to support the Judge\u2019s determination that the incidents \u201creflect a pattern \nof dishonesty.\u201d  Decision at 19.       \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in her whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching her decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel has cited, they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor \nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. \nAug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nLuke S. Rose, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 26, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. Prior to hearing, the Government amended the SOR \nto add an allegation under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). On May 23, 2022, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s parents and two siblings are citizens \nand residents of Jordan and that another sibling is a citizen of Iraq and resident of the United Arab \nEmirates. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant had a relationship with a Russian \ncitizen between about July 2016 and January 2017 and that he falsified both his security clearance \napplication (SCA) and his personal subject interview (PSI) by failing to disclose the relationship.  \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was convicted of three counts of felony assault \nin October 2019 and sentenced to 120 days in jail and four years of supervised probation.

The Judge found against Applicant on all allegations. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to afford \nApplicant due process; whether she failed to give appropriate weight to his relationship with \nanother federal agency; and whether she failed to consider mitigating evidence regarding the \nGuideline J allegation. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. \nApplicant is 50 years old. Born in Jordan, Applicant came to the United States in 1990, \nmarried in 1992, and became a naturalized citizen in 2000. He has three adult children from his \nmarriage, which ended in divorce in 2002. From 2003 through 2010, Applicant was employed as \na linguist for federal contractors and deployed to combat areas in the Middle East. He owned his \nown business from 2012 through 2017, when he closed it to pursue another opportunity as a \nlinguist with a federal contractor.  \nForeign Influence \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a U.S. permanent resident who lives in Jordan, and he communicates \nwith her with varying frequency. He hasn\u2019t seen his mother since November 2017, when he \nreturned to Jordan for his father\u2019s funeral. He has two sisters, both of whom now reside in Jordan.  \nHe communicates with them occasionally. Applicant has two brothers: one resides in the United \nStates and the other in Germany.  \nDue to its proximity to Syria and Lebanon, Jordan continues to encounter terrorism.  \nCertain regions of the country hold anti-Western sentiments and protest United States\u2019 policies. \nSignificant human rights violations are prevalent in the country. \nPersonal Conduct \nIn the course of the security clearance investigation, Applicant asserted that he had been \nunofficially working with an employee (Mr. N) from another government agency (AGA) since \n2015. Applicant claims he initiated that relationship after receiving information about issues in \nthe Middle East that Applicant thought would be of interest to the AGA. \nApplicant admits that he had a relationship with a Russian citizen (RC), between July 2016 \nand January 2017. He met RC in a third country while on a flight layover and saw her a few times \nover the next several months when he again was transiting through the third country. In January \n2017, RC came to the United States and stayed with Applicant at his home. Some months later, \nshe obtained a position with a U.S. university. \nApplicant stated that RC has advanced degrees in scientific fields and worked for a U.S. \ncompany in Russia. He told Mr. N about RC. Applicant reported that he had an intimate \nrelationship with RC, but that he considered her a \u201csubject\u201d from whom to gather information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last communication with RC was in January 2017 when she stayed with him \nin the United States. He testified that he searched her property without authorization while she \nwas staying with him and that he forwarded information to Mr. N. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had a relationship with RC, as \nalleged. He denied, however, that he intentionally withheld information about the relationship on \nhis SCA and stated he did not report it because he did not have a \u201ccontinuing\u201d relationship with \nRC. Applicant also admitted that he failed to disclose the relationship to his clearance investigator \nduring his first PSI in June 2017. However, Applicant stated that he was precluded from disclosing \nthe relationship because a government official told him not to share that information. \nApplicant testified that a friend informed the clearance investigator of his relationship with \nRC. Subsequently, Applicant was re-interviewed in July 2017 and asked why he did not disclose \ninformation about RC in his security forms. Applicant said that he initially disclosed her name to \na U.S. Embassy in the Middle East in July 2016. He also said that he met with an unidentified \ngovernment official and was told not to disclose his relationship with RC to anyone else, including \nin his security forms. \nApplicant submitted copies of emails to and from Mr. N as proof of his relationship with \nthe agency. He did not present evidence from Mr. N or any government agency to corroborate his \nassertion that he was instructed not to disclose his contacts with RC. He claimed that his briefings \nand communications with Mr. N were obvious proof of his connections to the AGA. \u201cI find that \nhis intense interest in working with [the AGA] was his motivation for deceiving the government.\u201d \nDecision at 5. \nCriminal Conduct \nApplicant admitted the allegation regarding his 2019 criminal conviction. In May 2014, \nApplicant was involved in a violent physical altercation with his daughter and her boyfriend at his \ndaughter\u2019s apartment. Applicant stated that his ex-wife told him that the boyfriend was dangerous \nand was involved in drugs. During the fight, Applicant seriously injured the boyfriend, and a \nwarrant for his arrest was subsequently issued. \nApplicant said he did not know about the warrant until January 2019, when he was stopped \nby the police for a traffic violation. In October 2019, Applicant was convicted by a jury of three \nfelony counts of aggravated assault. In January 2020, he was sentenced to 120 days of incarceration \nand four years of supervised probation. He remains on probation until 2024. At the hearing, \nApplicant denied that he was the aggressor in the fight, despite multiple witnesses\u2019 statements to \nthe contrary. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted in pertinent part. \nGuideline B: Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by his ongoing contact \nwith family members residing in Jordan. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThose connections create continuing and significant potential for conflict of interest \nand risk of coercion, exploitation, or pressure. Although Applicant established \nconnections to the United States since arriving in 1990, including owning a home, \nattending college, and working as a linguist for American troops in the early 2000\u2019s, \nhe frequently returned to Jordan and the UAE between 2002 and 2017 for family \nvisits, demonstrating his ongoing Jordanian attachments. He maintains frequent \ncontact with his mother and sisters who reside in Jordan. On balance, the evidence \ndemonstrates heightened risk of foreign coercive exploitation, and significant \npotential for a conflict of interest. [Decision at 9.] \nGuideline E \nBetween July 2016 and January 2017, Applicant engaged in an intimate relationship with \na foreign national whom he first met in a third country hotel. Applicant claims that he initiated \nthe relationship because he believed that RC could provide him information that may be of interest \nto Mr. N, an alleged AGA employee with whom he had been interacting since 2015. \nIn May 2017, Applicant completed his SCA. In Section 19-Foreign Contacts, Applicant \ndid not disclose his contact with RC, with whom he had been involved as recently as January 2017. \nIn his November 2019 Answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed he did not reveal the relationship \nbecause he was not in a \u201ccontinuing\u201d relationship with RC, which he interpreted to mean ongoing \nand into the present. \u201cApplicant\u2019s explanation is not believable, given he had been in contact with \nan alleged [AGA employee] since 2015, and his specific purpose in establishing the relationship \nwith [RC] in March 2016 was to obtain information and pass it on to Mr. N.\u201d Decision at 10. \nDuring his June 2017 clearance interview, Applicant denied having had close or continuing \ncontact with any non-U.S. citizen during his international travel in 2016 and 2017. During his \nsubsequent interview in July 2017, the investigator asked him if he had dated anyone from Russia, \nand Applicant then disclosed his relationship with RC. He told the investigator that he did not \ninitially disclose the relationship because an agent with a government agency told him not to \ndisclose it. Applicant did not submit credible proof that a legitimate U.S. agency directed him to \nnot disclose his relationship during his security clearance investigation. He intentionally failed to \ndisclose requested information during his June 2017 clearance interview. \nApplicant did not voluntarily disclose his relationship with RC prior to being confronted \nwith the information in July 2017 by an investigator who had learned of it through Applicant\u2019s \nfriend. Applicant\u2019s non-disclosure was not minor but instead was significant and repetitive. \nApplicant persistently claimed that he was directed by another government agency not to disclose \nthis requested information during the security clearance process. \u201cThere is no substantive evidence \nto verify his highly unlikely assertions. . . . The personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated.\u201d  Decision at 11. \nGuideline J \nIn October 2019, Applicant was convicted of three felonies. In January 2020, he was \nsentenced to 120 days of confinement and placed on supervised probation for four years, and he \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nremained on probation as of his hearing.

Directive, \nEncl. 2, App. A. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation . . . . Sufficient time \nhas not passed because Applicant remains on a four-year supervised probation until \nJanuary 2024. There is minimal evidence that since January 2020, he has been \nsatisfactorily complying with the terms of his probation, or that he has established \na good employment record and/or other evidence of rehabilitation. The criminal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. [Decision at 12.] \nWhole Person \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B, E, and J under this whole-\nperson analysis. However, one further concern requires mentioning, and that is \nApplicant\u2019s insistence that he did not intentionally withhold information about [RC] \nwhen he submitted his May 2017 SCA and during his June 2017 interview. This \nrecord does not contain sufficient evidence to find that anyone from a U.S. \ngovernment agency directed Applicant to deceive the DOD during the security \nclearance process. Without such verifiable evidence of those assertions and \nassociations, Applicant\u2019s credibility and veracity remain a serious concern. [Id.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in three regards: failing to afford him due process, \nfailing to give appropriate weight to his relationship with another federal agency, and failing to \nconsider extenuating circumstances surrounding his convictions for assault. \nApplicant alleges that the Judge did not allow him to call witnesses or to present a statement \nduring his case in chief. The record does not support this assignment of error. With regard to \nwitnesses, the Case Management Order issued by the Judge required both parties to submit witness \nlists the week prior to the hearing. The record contains no indication that Applicant submitted a \nwitness list.  At the beginning of the hearing, the Judge asked Applicant if he intended to call any \nwitnesses, and the Applicant responded that he did not. Tr. at 8. Nevertheless, counsel for \nApplicant now alleges that Applicant \u201cwas denied the opportunity to call witnesses he had ready \nand waiting to testify by phone.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6, citing to the following statement by Applicant \nduring his testimony: \u201cMy probation officer sent the request recommending the early probation \nand actually, he said we can call him at Fort Knox before 4:00 pm, he can verify that, he\u2019s in his \noffice today, recommending early termination.\u201d Id. at 7, quoting Tr. at 95. \nCounsel presents this as \u201conly one example of the evidence [Applicant] was not given the \nopportunity to present.\u201d Id. at 8. This allegation is not an accurate reflection of the record. The \nrecord indicates that Applicant did not intend or desire to call the probation officer as a witness, \nbut instead made an offhanded reference to his availability. It is not the Judge\u2019s job to call \nwitnesses. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-1931 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 1992). Instead, it is an \napplicant\u2019s job to present witnesses and other evidence sufficient to mitigate the concerns raised \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \nin his case.

The record does not support the assertion that Applicant planned \nto call this witness or any other. \nApplicant also alleges that he was \u201cdenied the opportunity to make his own statement as \nevidence in his case\u201d and was \u201conly given the opportunity to provide documentary evidence.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 6. Again, this allegation is not supported by the record. Applicant highlights that \nthe Judge cut him off in his opening statement, which is accurate, as it appeared that Applicant \nwas intending to provide substantive testimony rather than an overview of his case. She assured \nhim at the time that he was \u201cgoing to have ample opportunity to testify to all the facts so just give \nus a brief overview of what your defense is in this matter.\u201d Tr. at 11\u201312. Applicant then made a \nbrief introductory statement. \nAfter reviewing and admitting Applicant\u2019s exhibits, the Judge asked a few preliminary \nquestions about Applicant\u2019s security clearance status and then turned to Department Counsel for \ncross-examination. Following cross-examination, the Judge asked a number of questions to clarify \nthe record on the Guideline J and Guideline E allegations.  The Judge then asked Applicant \u201c[D]o \nyou have any other statements or anything else you want to tell me right now before we go into \nclosing arguments?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cYes,\u201d and then testified in detail both about his \nrelationship with Mr. N and the circumstances that led to the fight with his daughter\u2019s boyfriend. \nTr. at 107\u2013114. \nAlthough this order of events is not necessarily the norm at DOHA hearings, the Judge has \nleeway in how she conducts a hearing, so long as it is within the parameters set forth in the \nDirective.1 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00857 at 6, n.11 (App.Bd. May 8, 2019). Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s assertion, he had the opportunity to present his testimony, and he availed himself of \nthat opportunity. Moreover, at the conclusion of Applicant\u2019s testimony, the Judge alerted \nApplicant that he had an additional opportunity to provide a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a ten-\nminute break and you\u2019ll have an opportunity to give a final closing statement. If you\u2019re feeling \nlike there\u2019s something else you want to say that you didn\u2019t have an opportunity, you\u2019re going to \nhave at least 10 [minute break] and however long it takes Department Counsel.\u201d Tr. at 114. Upon \ntheir return from the break, Applicant did not request to testify further but made a lengthy, detailed, \nand wide-ranging closing statement. Id. at 120\u2013128. The Judge did not preclude Applicant from \ntestifying. In sum, we are convinced upon our review of the record that Applicant was provided \nwith the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  \nSecond, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to give appropriate weight to Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with another federal agency. His argument on appeal reiterates his testimony at \nhearing. As part of his work for another agency, \u201che was collecting information through [RC] and \nwas told to not acknowledge the relationship unless specifically asked about this particular \nindividual.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. Consequently, he argues, AG \u00b6 17(b) applies: [T]he refusal or \nfailure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by advice \nof legal counsel or of a person with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A. Applicant \nargues that, to the extent the Judge appears to believe that he was working for the AGA, she should \n1 The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery, and evidence and shall conduct all \nproceedings in a fair, timely and orderly manner.

Her failure to do so \u201cignored common sense and the realities of intelligence collection \noperations that, undoubtedly, require a level of secrecy and non-affiliation that the court should \ntake notice of when evaluating the evidence.\u201d Appeal Brief at 9. \nThe Judge did not make a specific finding as to whether Applicant was working for another \nfederal agency or not, nor was she required to. Applicant\u2019s relationship with another federal \nagency was not the subject of any allegation on the SOR. What was alleged is that Applicant \nintentionally failed to disclose a relationship with a Russian citizen on his May 2017 SCA and in \nhis June 2017 PSI. He admitted to those omissions and failed to produce any evidence to \ncorroborate his claim that a U.S. Government agency directed him to falsify his DoD security \nclearance application and interview. Obviously, testimony is evidence and, in an appropriate case, \ntestimony can support findings on its own. However, it is not unreasonable for a Judge to expect \nan applicant to corroborate his claims that he has mitigated the concerns set forth in an SOR. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07062 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2017). In a DOHA proceeding, the \napplicant bears the burden of persuasion that he should have access to classified information, and \ncorroborating evidence can certainly assist an applicant in meeting that burden. In the case before \nus, the Judge apparently did not find Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated assertions to be sufficiently \ncredible so as to satisfy the mitigating conditions set forth in the Directive, and we give deference \nto a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02588 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, \n2019).   \nThird, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider evidence that mitigated the \ncriminal conduct allegation under AG \u00b6 32(b), the individual was pressured or coerced into \ncommitting the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life. Directive, Encl. \n2, App. A. The Board has long held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in these \nproceedings and precludes applicants from contending they did not engage in the criminal acts for \nwhich they were convicted. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 88-2271 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 1991) \n(\"Applicant's conviction collaterally estops him from challenging, in these proceedings, the \nvalidity of his conviction or his guilt of the offenses for which he was convicted.\u201d). By advancing \ntheories of coercion and duress that constitute legal defenses to the criminal charges, Applicant is \nseeking to re-litigate his felony convictions for aggravated assault. The Board applies the doctrine \nof collateral estoppel and finds no merit in this assignment of error. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 5, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations), and Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On March 8, 2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 13 concerns under Guideline E, including 12 falsifications during the \nsecurity clearance adjudication process. Additionally, the SOR alleged 22 financial concerns \nunder Guideline F and 1 drug use concern under Guideline H. The Judge found favorably for \nApplicant on the Guideline H concern and on one allegation under Guideline F.  The Judge found \nadversely to Applicant on the remaining 21 Guideline F allegations and on all Guideline E \nallegations. The Judge\u2019s favorable findings are not an issue on appeal. The Applicant raised the \nfollowing issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhether he erred in applying the mitigating conditions, and whether his adverse decision is \nconsequently arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. \nApplicant is 34 years old and employed as a contract security officer. From 2007\u20132013, \nshe was employed by her state\u2019s division of corrections as a corrections officer. She was \nunemployed from November 2013 to May 2014, worked for a non-DoD contractor from May 2014 \nto May 2017, and secured her current job in May 2017.  She has never held a security clearance. \nDrug Use and Termination \nWhile working for the state\u2019s division of corrections, Applicant tested positive for \nmarijuana in July 2013 in a random drug test. Applicant was interviewed, acknowledged her use \nof marijuana, received 15 days of disciplinary suspension, and was referred via her employer\u2019s \nassistance program to a drug counseling out-patient program. In October 2013, Applicant again \ntested positive for marijuana in a random drug test. In November 2013, she resigned from her \nposition as a state correctional officer in lieu of termination. The record contains no evidence of \nany drug use since October 2013. At hearing, Applicant denied any illegal drug use in October \n2013, denied receiving a notice of termination, and denied resigning in lieu of termination.  \nFinances \nIRS records confirm that Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015\u20132018 until November 2019. For those tax years, Applicant owes delinquent \nfederal taxes in excess of $16,500 and delinquent state taxes in the approximate amount of $2,300. \nTo date, Applicant has made no material progress in addressing her delinquent federal and state \ntaxes and has no documented plans in place with either tax authority.    \nIn addition to her tax delinquencies, Applicant accrued 19 delinquent medical and \nconsumer debts that total over $32,000. Of these alleged debts, several were satisfied involuntarily \nand one was resolved voluntarily. Thirteen remain unresolved, with an aggregate balance of over \n$23,000. \nOmissions and Misstatements \nIn April 2018, Applicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) and failed to \ndisclose the following: her use of marijuana in July 2013 and again in October 2013; her 15-day \nsuspension in August 2013 for testing positive on a random drug test; her use of illegal drugs while \nemployed as a corrections officer for her state corrections agency in 2013; her state employer\u2019s \nreferral to counseling in August 2013 after the failed drug test; her resignation from her position \nas a corrections officer in November 2013 after testing positive for the second time; her failure to \ntimely file her federal and state tax returns; her failure to timely pay her federal and state tax debts; \nand her accrual of delinquent medical and consumer debts.  Applicant denied any intent to falsify \nher SCA, but her explanations were not persuasive. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn subsequent security clearance interviews with a government investigator in August 2018 \nand February 2019, Applicant denied that she was suspended from her employment, stated that \nshe voluntarily left the division of corrections, and denied any failure to file or pay her federal and \nstate income taxes.   \nIn her response to DOHA interrogatories, submitted in September 2019, Applicant denied \never using marijuana and denied being placed on a 15-day suspension for drug use. She \nacknowledged that she did test positive for drugs in July and October 2013, but attributed those \ntest results to prescription medicine that she was taking. \nBased on a thorough review of the evidence, Applicant failed to provide honest and candid \nanswers to the pertinent questions asked of her on her SCA, by the government investigator, and \nby the DOHA interrogations on the following topics: her past employment issues, her drug use \nand positive test results, and financial issues associated with her tax filing lapses and delinquent \ndeb accumulations.  \nIn an unrelated Guideline E matter, records document that Applicant was charged with \ndischarging a firearm in January 2019. Applicant pleaded guilty to the charge in an April 2019 \ncourt hearing and was granted probation before judgment. Applicant has since disposed of the \nfirearm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted in pertinent part. \nGuideline F \nWhile Applicant receives some extenuating benefit based on her reported medical issues \nand period of unemployment, her tax arrearages and delinquent medical and consumer debt \nremained unresolved following her return to full-time employment. Although some circumstances \nthat caused her financial distress were beyond Applicant\u2019s control, she failed to act responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Although Applicant disputes two debts, she does not submit adequate \ndocumentation to corroborate the bases of her disputes.  On those debts she admits, she has failed \nto take documented voluntary steps to address the accumulated tax delinquencies and other debts. \nGuideline E \nBased on the evidence presented, none of the mitigating conditions apply to \nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case. Providing materially false information in her [SCA] \nand ensuing [clearance interviews] and DOHA-propounded interrogatories about \nher past marijuana usage, positive drug tests, disciplinary actions taken by state \ncorrections, and financial issues associated with her untimely federal and state tax \nfiling and accumulated delinquent tax and other debts not only impaired the DoD\u2019s \nability to ascertain Applicant\u2019s past and current drug involvement and financial \ncondition, but revealed serious lapses of candor and judgment by Applicant. \n[Decision at 15.] \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, she \ncontends that the Judge erred in two regards: first, he failed to consider all the mitigation evidence \nsubmitted; and, second, he failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions. Consequently, \nApplicant argues, the Judge rendered a decision that was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nOf note, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief focuses almost exclusively on the Judge\u2019s findings under \nGuideline F. The brief does not address in any substantive fashion the Judge\u2019s 13 adverse \nconclusions under Guideline E, to include that the Applicant had deliberately falsified information \non multiple occasions on her SCA, during her clearance interviews, and in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories. \nFirst, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to adhere to the procedures required . . . when \nhe failed to consider all relevant evidence submitted by Appellant . . . .\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. \nHowever, counsel cites to no evidence of record that the Judge failed to consider. \u201cThe appeal \nbrief must state the specific issue or issues being raised, and cite specific portions of the case record \nsupporting any alleged error.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30. Applicant\u2019s counsel failed to comply with this \nfundamental requirement and failed to carry his burden on this issue. \nSecond, Applicant argues that the Judge misapplied the mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F. For example, in arguing for application of Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 20(a)1, \nApplicant notes that her financial issues arose seven years ago, under circumstances unlikely to \nrecur, and asserts that these past financial issues should not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. However, her debts remain delinquent. It is well-established \nthat debts that became delinquent several years ago are still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that \nApplicant\u2019s counsel has cited, they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor \nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. \nAug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that she \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \n1 AG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nDirective, Encl. 2., App. A. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 10, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On January 5, \n2022, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nMark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged four arrests between May 2008 and April 2017 for \ndriving under the influence or driving while intoxicated. Applicant admitted to three of the \nallegations, with clarification, and admitted the fourth in part. Under Guideline J and Guideline \nE, the same incidents were cross-alleged. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline \nE allegation and against him on the Guideline G and Guideline J allegations. The Judge\u2019s favorable \nfindings were not raised as an issue on appeal. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his mid-thirties. He served in the military from 2005 through 2012 and has \nheld a security clearance since 2006. Around May 2008, Applicant returned to his military \ninstallation after drinking and was apprehended at the gate for driving while impaired. Applicant \nbelieved his blood alcohol content (BAC) was below the legal limit. He received Article 15 \nnonjudicial punishment for drunk driving and subsequently attended alcohol-related training.  \nAround September 2011, Applicant was arrested for DUI with a BAC of .08 and convicted \nof DUI in a civilian court. His sentence included probation, a fine, and court costs. Applicant \nsuccessfully completed an alcohol abuse class and modified his alcohol consumption.  \nApplicant was arrested twice for DUI in 2017\u2014in January and again in April. For the \nApril 2017 arrest, he was cited for DUI and driving with a suspended license. Additionally, the \npolice alleged that Applicant failed to yield to their commands and that they drew and pointed their \nfirearms. Applicant did not remember either resisting arrest or having firearms pointed at him. \nHis first BAC from the April 2017 DUI arrest was .197, and his second BAC was .16. The January \nand April DUI charges were adjudicated in the same court proceeding and resulted in two DUI \nconvictions. His combined sentence included probation, a fine, court costs, and a suspended jail \nsentence.  He attended an alcohol and substance abuse class.  \nApplicant has never been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. He now has different \nfriends from 2017 and enjoys healthy activities unrelated to alcohol consumption. Applicant \ndenied having alcohol-related blackouts or withdrawal symptoms. Over his adult life, he has \nabstained for nine or ten month periods. He completed alcohol-related counseling in April 2018 \nand has signed a statement of intent not to drive while under the influence of alcohol. \nIn March 2020, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) provided an assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption. Her report adopted Applicant\u2019s assertion that, of the four \nincidents, the only time in which his BAC level was above the legal limit was the April 2017 \nincident; she did not indicate his BAC levels for that arrest. She concluded that Applicant has not \nengaged in binge drinking or habitual drinking to the point of impaired judgment and highlighted \nhis successful completion of random drug and alcohol testing, alcohol and drug abuse classes, and \neight hours of one-one-one counseling.  The LCSW diagnosed no alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant presented character evidence that spoke to his knowledge, intelligence, honesty, \ndependability, and volunteerism. His evidence confirms his success in his chosen field, as well as \nhis prior military career.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges four alcohol-related incidents involving the police, courts, or \nboth: a nonjudicial punishment in 2008 and three civilian convictions in 2011 and 2017. In his \nApril 2017 DUI, his BAC was .16. Although the term \u201cbinge drinking\u201d is not defined in the \nDirective, Applicant\u2019s BAC of .16 for the April 2017 DUI is high enough to establish Applicant \nengaged in binge consumption under the generally accepted definitions.      \nAfter each arrest, Applicant completed some type of alcohol training or counseling. \nAlthough he received a favorable prognosis from the LCSW, the value of that prognosis is \ndiminished by the LCSW\u2019s apparent failure to consider critical information, including the \ncommander\u2019s determination that Applicant committed a drunk driving offense in 2008, his three \nsubsequent civilian convictions, and his elevated BAC during his April 2017 incident. \nAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and rehabilitative \nefforts, I have continuing doubts about the risks of poor decisions after excessive \nalcohol consumption. It is too soon to conclude alcohol-related incidents involving \nthe police and courts or compromise of classified information are unlikely to recur. \n[Decision at 8.] \nUnder his analysis of the whole person concept, the Judge concluded: \nThe factors weighing against continuation of his security clearance are more \nsubstantial than the mitigating circumstances. . . . He is not currently involved in \nany alcohol counseling or treatment. He said that he continues to consume alcohol \nalbeit at a responsible level. He has had previous periods of abstinence. He did not \nprovide any statements from friends or family discussing his current level of \nalcohol consumption.  \n.  .  . \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With more time without excessive alcohol consumption and criminal \nconduct, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security \nclearance worthiness.  [Decision at 11.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in two regards: first, he failed to consider all the mitigation evidence \nsubmitted; and, second, he failed to properly apply the whole-person concept. Consequently, \nApplicant argues, the Judge failed to adhere to the procedures required by the Directive and \nrendered a decision that was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs an example, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to consider the mitigating effect \nof the passage of time: \u201cThe amount of time that has passed since the Appellant\u2019s last actual binge \nshould have been given more weight regarding his reliability and trustworthiness. The Appellant\u2019s \nlast case of overconsumption was in April 2017, almost five (5) years ago.\u201d (emphasis added) \nAppeal Brief at 6. Surprisingly, Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s characterization of his .16 \nBAC in April 2017 as indicative of binge drinking. Regardless of this incongruity, our review of \nthe record and decision establishes that the Judge carefully considered all evidence in mitigation, \nincluding the passage of time since the 2017 convictions, but determined it was insufficient\u2014for \nnow\u2014given the number of DUIs and the elevated BAC of the most recent. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the \nrequirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record \nin reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020).  \nAlthough we give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that Applicant\u2019s counsel has cited, \nthey are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s \ndecision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 10, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Department Counsel requested a hearing. On \nNovember 3, 2021, after the close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nJudge Claude R. Heiny granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Department Counsel \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleged that Applicant downloaded child pornography on \nmultiple occasions between 2006 and 2008; and, that, in about 2006, he used online chat forums \nto have sexual discussions with females, to include underage girls, during which he would expose \nhis penis via webcam.

Consistent with the following, we reverse. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s factual findings are summarized below, in \npertinent part: \nApplicant is in his late thirties; he married in 2014 and has three young children. He served \non active duty in the military from 2001 through 2007 and in the National Guard from 2008 \nthrough 2014.  \nApplicant does not deny the allegations.

He does not remember very much of the conversations he had with the agents who \ncame to his home. He remembers that the general nature of their request was computer-related, \nand he gave them what they asked about.  Applicant\u2019s computer was returned to him in 2013, and \nhe was informed that no charges would be filed. At the time of the search, Applicant was a member \nof the National Guard. He stated that he did not inform his superiors because he was unable to \nprovide his unit with a reason for the search.  \nDuring his security clearance interview, Applicant stated he believed the seizure of his \ncomputer was due to down-loading pirated music and downloading pornographic images. When \nasked if the images included pictures of children, Applicant said that he did not think so. At his \nhearing, Applicant denied all knowledge of these events, to include the name of the agency that \nsearched his home and seized his computer.  \nApplicant has serious memory problems. He was asked at hearing if he had ever been \ndiagnosed with any sort of memory defect, he responded: \nI swear I need to [be]cause I really can\u2019t remember the birth of my children \nanymore, and like I can\u2019t barely remember my marriage. I know it happened and I \nknow where it was, but I can\u2019t give you details. I can\u2019t give you the details of my \nkids\u2019 birth[s].

Applicant stated that he preferred talking \nwith woman ages 18 to 20. None of the women looked underage, but he never verified their ages. \nHe said sometimes the woman would ask to see his penis, and he complied. Applicant stated he \nwould use a screen name for a while, then delete it, and get a new one. He stated he did so because \nhe was afraid of getting caught by law enforcement. \nApplicant never solicited child pornography, never sent child pornography to another, and \nnever intended to download child pornography. If he suspected he was talking to a minor in the \nchat room, he would end the chat immediately. He would never expose himself to anyone he \nbelieved was a minor. \nApplicant did not recall telling the FBI he had performed searches using terms such as \u201c13\u00ad\nyear-old\u201d through \u201c17-year-old\u201d females. He was not and is not sexually aroused by children. If \nany of his web searches resulted in accessing a child pornography website, he would immediately \ndelete the download before watching it. He estimated that 10 to 15 videos may have been \ninadvertently downloaded in this manner before he deleted them. \nApplicant made the online searches alleged between 2006 and 2008.  As of April 2010, he \nhas not made such searches, not downloaded any music or pornography from the internet, and not \ngone to chat rooms. When asked about the statement he provided to the FBI, Applicant responded, \n\u201c[I]f they said we had that conversation, then we must have, but I don\u2019t recall the conversations \nthat we had that long ago. (Tr. 32)\u201d Decision at 5. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analyses under Guidelines D and J, as well as his \nwhole-person evaluation, are quoted below, in pertinent part: \nGuideline D \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case.  The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted.  \nApplicant\u2019s computer was taken by the FBI and searched for child pornography.  \nThe computer was returned to Applicant, and no adverse action was taken against \nApplicant. He never solicited child pornography, never sent child pornography to \nanother, or intentionally downloaded child pornography. \nThe search of his \ncomputer revealed he was not in possession of child pornography. The above \ndisqualifying condition does not apply.

He stated if he suspected it was immoral or child \npornography he would immediately delete it without viewing it.  \n.  .  . \nApplicant\u2019s inadvertent possession of child pornography occurred 13 to 15 years \nago.

His actions do not currently cast doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  [Decision at 7\u20138.] \nWhole-Person Concept \nWhen Applicant was in his mid-20s, 13 to 15 years ago, he was young, single, and \nhad a drinking problem. When drinking, he would log onto chat rooms to talk with \nfemales, whom he assumed were young adults. Sometime, the talk would turn to a \nsexual nature, and one thing led to another where he and the woman would show \nintimate areas of their anatomy . . . . During this same period, he was downloading \nmusic and pornography. He believes the pornography was adult pornography and \nwas not illict or inappropriate . . . .  Had the FBI\u2019s search of his computer revealed \nchild pornography, his computer would not have been returned to him, and he \nwould likely have faced adverse actions. No adverse actions were ever taken \nagainst him. \nIn the intervening 13 to 15 years, Applicant has married, became a father of three, \nno longer downloads music or pornography on his computer, no longer visits chat \nrooms, and no longer has a drinking problem. He is no longer the young, single, \ncollege student with a drinking problem. The whole \u2013 person factors mitigate in \nhis favor . . . . \nApplicant exhibited some lack of recall about the specific incidents and statement \nhe made to the FBI during its investigation. Given the passage of time, it is \nunderstandable that he may lack accurate recall at this time. Specifically, not \naddressed in this decision, is how Applicant\u2019s memory should be addressed in the \ngranting of a clearance. If his memory problems were to be deemed a security \nconcern, a separate investigation should be rendered.

Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary and capricious, we will \nreview the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails \nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nThis decision fails in each of these regards. We focus on the most dispositive below. \nFailure to Examine Relevant Evidence \nThe FBI investigative report on Applicant (GE 4) contained relevant evidence\u2014including \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to criminal sexual conduct\u2014that the Judge failed to examine in his \nfindings of fact and his analysis, to include: \nThe FBI initiated its investigation because it received a report that Applicant, who was 27 \nyears old, exposed himself twice over the Internet to someone whom he believed to be under-aged. \nOn April 12, 2010, an FBI agent and a second Federal agent interviewed Applicant in a conference \nroom at his job site. After being advised of the purpose of the interview, Applicant made numerous \nadmissions regarding his sexual interactions with children online and his possession of child \npornography. \nApplicant admitted exposing himself to females on the internet approximately twice per \nweek and confirmed that \u201c[q]uite a bit\u201d of this conduct involved people under the age of 18, as age \nwas not a deterrent to exposing himself. GE 4 at 5. It is clear from Applicant\u2019s statement that this \nonline conduct had begun in 2006 and was still ongoing in April 2010. He admitted that he needed \nhelp, as he had tried to quit, but was unable to stop. He had a system of cycling different screen \nnames to avoid detection by law enforcement. Applicant admitted to agents that he considered \nhimself \u201ca predator among minors.\u201d Id. Regarding his interest in child pornography, Applicant \nmade the following statements, as summarized by the agents: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n[Applicant] said that he has searched for and downloaded child pornography \nwith his . . . laptop computer. He said that he was curious because it was something \nthat he has never seen before. He indicated that he has performed searches using \nsuch terms such as \u201c13 yo\u201d , \u201c14 yo\u201d, \u201915 yo\u201d, 16 yo\u201d, \u201c17 yo\u201d, and \u201cRaven Riley\u201d.  \nHe said that he will type in \u201c13 yo\u201d and begin downloading the results, sometimes \nhaving several in que waiting to download.  [Applicant] said that he prefers videos \nrather than photos. He said that he will download the child pornography videos \nwhile watching adult pornography in the foreground. Following the download of \nthe child pornography he will delete it before he watches it.  \nHe said that he searched for child pornography from 2006\u20132008 and has \nsince stopped doing so. He knew that downloading and child pornography was \nwrong he said that he did it out of curiosity. He does not masturbate to child \npornography only to adult pornography while the child pornography is \ndownloading. \nOn some occasions he would begin to watch the child pornography that he \ndownloaded only to immediately stop and delete the videos from his computer. He \nestimates that he has only downloaded 10-15 child pornography videos. He can \ntell the difference between a 13\u201314 year old and a 18\u201319 year old based on the \nyounger of the two looking like little children. [Applicant] informed investigators \nthat he stopped downloading child pornography in 2008 but is unsure what will be \nfound on his computer. [Id. at 5\u20136.] \nThe Judge\u2019s recitation of facts omits virtually all the above inculpatory details; instead, he \nrelies upon Applicant\u2019s vague and ambiguous denials at the hearing, discussed further below, to \nform the narrative of his findings of fact.  Throughout the decision, the Judge consistently ignores \nthe criminality of Applicant\u2019s conduct, despite the evidence to the contrary found in the FBI report.  \nFor example, despite Applicant\u2019s admissions in April 2010 that he searched for, downloaded, and \nintentionally possessed child pornography, the Judge found that Applicant \u201cnever intended to \ndownload child pornography.\u201d Decision at 4. Similarly, in his analysis under Guidelines D and \nJ, the Judge states that Applicant \u201cnever . . . intentionally downloaded child pornography\u201d and \nrefers to Applicant\u2019s \u201cinadvertent possession of child pornography.\u201d Id. at 6\u20137. Our review of the \nrecord convinces us that the Judge failed to examine and consider relevant evidence. \nFailure to Consider Important Aspects of the Case \nAdditionally, the Judge neglected to consider at least two critical aspects of the case: 1) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in his response to the SOR; and 2) the full range of \nsecurity concerns under Guideline D.  \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all allegations, although he referenced \nhis failure to recall details: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI [Applicant] admit to guidelines D, J & E . . . . I will not deny that these didn\u2019t \noccur as all I remember and I told the investigator that an investigating body came \nto my house and confiscated my computers for an investigation/suspicion and to \nwhat I assumed was for downloading music and pornography from the internet. I \ndo admit to downloading pornography but was never an intent to download illicit \nor inappropriate nature, if I suspected it was immoral I would delete it. I also admit \nto chatting with women online as I was a single male in my twenties but also with \nthe intent to chat with someone older than eighteen.  [SOR Response.] \nIn the decision, the Judge did not address Applicant\u2019s admissions, but rather sidestepped the issue \nby stating, \u201cApplicant did not deny the allegations.\u201d Decision at 2.  In doing so, the Judge did not \ndiscuss the consequences of those admissions. More specifically, he did not address what impact, \nif any, Applicant\u2019s qualifying statements in his SOR Response had on his admissions, whether \nApplicant\u2019s intent was a factor in the SOR allegations (e.g., does exposing one\u2019s private parts \nonline in a chat room to strangers over the age of eighteen raise security concerns under Guideline \nD?), and whether Applicant\u2019s admissions were sufficient to establish the presumption of a nexus \nbetween admitted conduct under the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security worthiness. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 12-10404 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2015). These were important aspects of the case \nthat the Judge should have addressed.  \nAdditionally, in his analysis under Guideline D, the Judge failed to address the full range \nof security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s alleged conduct and chose only to address whether \nApplicant\u2019s alleged conduct raised security concerns under Disqualifying Condition 13(a), quoted \nabove.  At the hearing, Applicant testified that he never told his employer, his wife, or his in-laws \nabout the FBI search. Tr. at 38-39. Yet, the Judge failed to examine whether Applicant\u2019s online \nsexual misconduct raised security concerns under Disqualifying Condition 13(c), sexual behavior \nthat causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Similarly, Applicant \nadmitted to Federal agents that he needed help as he had tried to stop his online sexual behavior, \nbut was unable to do so. GE 4 at 5. However, the Judge failed to address whether those statements \nraised security concerns under Disqualifying Condition 13(b), a pattern of compulsive, self-\ndestructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that the individual is unable to stop. Finally, the Judge \nalso failed to address whether Applicant\u2019s online sexual misconduct, which included exposing \nhimself to strangers about two times a week, raised concerns under Disqualifying Condition 13(d), \nsexual behavior . . . that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.  \nIn short, the Judge erred in failing to address important aspects of the case. \nFailure to Articulate Explanation for Conclusions \nThe Judge explicitly concluded that the Government failed to meet its initial burden of \nproduction under Guideline D. Decision at 6. His analysis under Guideline J is not a model of \nclarity, but he appears to conclude that the Government failed to meet its initial burden there as \nwell. Id. at 7. To reach those conclusions, the Judge cites repeatedly to the fact that Applicant \nwas not arrested or charged with crimes following the seizure of his computer, from which he \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ninfers that no child pornography was found on the computers.2 Id. at 2, 7, 9. However, regardless \nof what was found or not found on his laptop computer, Applicant confessed in April 2010 to \ncriminal sexual conduct with minors; his admissions alone were sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case under both Guidelines D and J. \nThe Judge\u2019s decision to ignore or reject the FBI report and instead adopt Applicant\u2019s in-\nhearing version of events is particularly baffling in light of the implausibility of Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony. At his hearing in June 2021, Applicant denied any memory whatsoever of his April \n2010 interview with two Federal agents at his job site, during which he was questioned about \nexposing himself to strangers online and searching for child pornography. Tr. at 28\u201338. Such an \ninterview with Federal agents is inarguably memorable, if not life-altering. Of note, Applicant \naltered his life: he testified that he stopped going to chat rooms after April 2010. But Applicant \nnevertheless insisted at hearing that he has no recollection of this interview and of the admissions \nthat he made. Although Applicant did admit to a dim memory of the subsequent search of his \nhome, even those details were elusive. He testified that he could recall only that an individual \nfrom an unknown Federal agency came to his home and that he gave this person permission to \nseize his computers for a \u201ccomputer related\u201d purpose. Tr. at 30. Applicant further claimed that, \nuntil he received the Government\u2019s evidence for the hearing, he believed the April 2010 search of \nhis home was related to downloading pirated music and viewing adult pornography. Decision at \n2, citing SOR Response; Tr. at 51. \nNotably, Applicant never denied that he made the admissions to Federal agents. When \ncross-examined in detail about the interview and his numerous admissions, he instead responded \ntime after time that he could not recall the interview and could not recall the admissions. However, \nApplicant contradicted his earlier admissions: he denied searching for, downloading, and viewing \nchild pornography or exposing himself to minors online. \nTo buttress his claim that he couldn\u2019t remember the interview with Federal agents, \nApplicant explained that he had many other memory issues as well and that he believed he may \nhave suffered a \u201cminor stroke.\u201d Tr. at 40-41, 43. As examples, Applicant claimed that he also \ncouldn\u2019t remember his marriage, the births of his three children, and much of his six years of \nmilitary service.  In cross-examination, Applicant admitted that he had never been diagnosed with \nany condition that might affect his memory and that he had never sought treatment for his \u201cminor \nstroke\u201d or purported memory malfunctions. Id. \nIn his findings of fact, the Judge largely adopts Applicant\u2019s in-hearing testimony and relies \nupon it to conclude that the Government failed to establish its prima facie case under Guidelines \nD and J. On appeal, Department Counsel argues that \u201cthe Decision fails to explain the gross \ndiscrepancy between Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony and his prior confessions to the FBI.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 8. We concur. By failing to include Applicant\u2019s 2010 admissions in the decision and to \nthen reconcile the discrepancies between those admissions and his hearing testimony, the Judge \nfails in his obligation to articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions. Additionally, \n2 Of note, the FBI report does not reflect whether or not a forensic examination of the computers uncovered child \npornography or whether the computers were returned to Applicant.

Assuming arguendo that Applicant genuinely has a memory disorder, such a \ndisorder does not reconcile the discrepancies in a manner favorable to Applicant. Applicant \nadmitted to criminal sexual misconduct in 2010 and denied the same misconduct in 2021. Memory \nloss would make his current version of events less reliable than his earlier admissions, which were \nmade while he was still engaged in online misconduct.3 \nFailure to Prosecute \nIn reaching his conclusions, the Judge refers repeatedly to the fact that Applicant was not \narrested or charged with crimes following the seizure of his computer, which weighed heavily in \nhis analysis. See Decision at 2, 7, 9. The Directive itself highlights that a security concern may \narise from \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 13(a). Moreover, it is well-established under Appeal \nBoard precedent that a failure to prosecute is not tantamount to a determination of innocence and \ndoes not resolve the Government\u2019s security concerns about the underlying conduct. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 18-02018 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2021) for a lengthier discussion of this issue.  \nCredibility Determination \nWe give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations, but that deference is not \nunfettered. As we have previously held, when the record contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility (e.g., prior admissions, inconsistent statements), the Judge should address that aspect \nof the record explicitly, explaining why he found the Applicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy \nof belief.  \u201cFailure to do so suggests that a Judge has merely substituted a favorable impression of \nan applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-07539 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, \n2018). In this regard, the Judge failed on two levels. First, he failed to include the gravamen of \nthe Applicant\u2019s admissions in his decision; and, second, he failed to explain why he found \nApplicant\u2019s vague and ambiguous in-hearing denials to be more worthy of belief than these earlier \nadmissions. We are persuaded that the Judge merely substituted a favorable impression of \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence and allowed this favorable impression to distort his \nfindings of fact, his analysis, and his evaluation of the whole person criteria. \n3 Although the Judge finds that Applicant has a serious memory problem, he explicitly declines to address the obvious \nsecurity issues that such a serious memory defect, if genuine, would raise. Instead, the Judge grants a security \nclearance and opines that \u201cif his memory problems were to be deemed a security concern, a separate investigation \nshould be rendered.\u201d Decision at 10. This statement reflects an inadequate understanding of the adjudicative process \nand the Judge\u2019s role. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17, the Judge has the authority to amend the SOR on his own motion to \nrender it in conformity with the evidence or for other good cause. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nAfter considering Department Counsel\u2019s arguments in light of the entirety of the record, \nwe conclude that the Judge failed to address important aspects of the record. Consequently, his \nfindings of fact are not based upon substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive E3.1.32.1. The Judge failed to articulate an explanation \nfor his conclusions and rendered a decision that runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  \nThe Judge\u2019s conclusions that the Government failed to establish its prima facie case under \nGuidelines D and J are arbitrary and capricious. Similarly, his whole-person analysis is arbitrary \nand capricious, as it is premised upon erroneous and incomplete findings of fact. The Judge\u2019s \nconclusions reflect a clear error of judgment and are so implausible that they cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. Accordingly, the favorable security clearance determination \ncannot be sustained. \nOrder \nThe Decision of the Judge is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F.

The Judge found against Applicant on each of the \nGuideline E allegations.  \nApplicant claims the denial of his security clearance was unfair and biased. He argues that \nhe has never given away Government information to anyone or another country. Although an \nabsence of prior security violations is a matter that a Judge should consider, along with all the \nother evidence in the record, it does not preclude a Judge from concluding that an applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances present security concerns that the applicant failed to mitigate. The Government \ndoes not have to wait until an applicant has compromised or mishandled classified information \nbefore it can deny the applicant a clearance. Even those with good security records can encounter \ncircumstances in which their judgment and reliability might be compromised. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01131 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2018). Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to establish the \nproceeding was conducted in an unfair manner, and they fail to rebut the presumption the Judge \nwas impartial and unbiased.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in finding or concluding he \u201cdid not take any [alcohol] \nclasses,\u201d \u201cdid not do community service,\u201d and \u201cdid not learn from [his] actions[.]\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 1. Applicant points to no specific record evidence in support of these arguments. He also \nchallenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he \u201cwas sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 88 days suspended\u201d \nfor the petit larceny offense. Decision at 2. The Judge\u2019s latter finding comports with the sentence \nreflected in Government Exhibit 4, a circuit court criminal record. None of Applicant\u2019s challenges \nestablish any harmful error.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.  The balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts \nto a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, but those arguments fail to show the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-02020 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2020). Applicant\u2019s brief also mentions an \nunfavorable decision will have an adverse impact on him and his family. The Directive, however, \ndoes not permit us to consider such consequences. Id. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Divorced, she holds a master\u2019s degree and is working towards \na doctorate. Applicant has worked for a DoD contractor since 2015, during which time she has \nsupported contracts with another Government agency (AGA). Applicant was granted a secret \nclearance in 2012. In 2017, pursuant to an AGA contract, Applicant underwent two polygraph \nexaminations, on December 7 and 13. AGA denied Applicant a clearance due to sexual behavior, \ncriminal conduct, and personal conduct concerns. \nApplicant worked as a prostitute in 2004 and from late 2006 until early 2007. She \ntestified that she did so \u201cfrom a research perspective.\u201d  Decision at 4. She engaged in prostitution \nabout 25 times. Applicant did not disclose this activity following her first polygraph, explaining \nthat she believed that it was outside the required time frame. During the interviews preceding and \nfollowing her second polygraph, Applicant disclosed this conduct. In addition to prostitution, \nApplicant had an affair with a married man (Man 1) beginning in 2007, which stemmed from Man \n1\u2019s having answered Applicant\u2019s advertisement of her sexual services. Applicant was also married \nfor a period of time during the course of the affair. The couple dated for seven to eight years, \nduring which time Man 1 provided her with financial support, to include permitting her to live in \nan apartment located on his property at a reduced rent. Applicant and Man 1 terminated the affair \nafter his wife discovered it. \nIn February 2015, Applicant joined a \u201csugar baby\u201d web site through which she met a \nsecond man (Man 2). The two met for lunch, after which Man 2 gave Applicant $100. He came \nto her house on a later occasion, during which they had consensual sex, and he left money outside \nApplicant\u2019s kitchen table before he left. Applicant disclosed this during interviews connected with \nher second polygraph.  \nIn addition to these sexual encounters, Applicant failed to disclose two instances of \nmarijuana use when she completed a security clearance application (SCA) in 2016. She did not \nacknowledge this failure in connection with her first polygraph examination \u201cbecause she was \nconcerned that the recency of her use would have a negative impact on her security processing.\u201d \nDecision 9. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct raised concerns under Guideline E: \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b\u204b 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . .;\u201d) (c) (\u201ccredible adverse information in several \nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability . . . unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;\u201d) and (e) (\u201cpersonal conduct or concealment about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group.

She found that Applicant made no efforts to disclose her marijuana use in her 2016 SCA \nand that Applicant had acknowledged she had not addressed it in connection with her first \npolygraph due to concern that it might impair her effort to obtain a clearance.  \nI did not find Applicant to be candid or credible at the hearing.  Her testimony was \ninconsistent, in contradiction of the record evidence, and not credible in light of the \nrecord evidence. Her failure to truthfully disclose her marijuana use on her 2016 \nSCA also weighs against any mitigation, rehabilitation, and favorable conclusions \nconcerning her credibility. [Decision at 15.] \nDiscussion \nReliance upon Matters not in Evidence \nApplicant contends that the Judge cited to matters contained in Government Exhibits (GE) \n2 and 7. These were portions of DoD reports of investigation (ROI) that were not admissible under \nDirective \u204b\u204b E3.1.20 and 22. \nDepartment Counsel offered GE 2 in his case in chief.  This exhibit contained Applicant\u2019s \nwritten comments on the summary of a clearance interview. The Judge admitted this exhibit \ninsofar as it included handwritten statements by Applicant in response to DOHA interrogatories, \nbut she stated that she would give no weight to the interview summary itself. GE 7 is a summary \nof a clearance interview conducted in 2016. The Judge did not admit this document into evidence, \nbut she permitted Department Counsel to use it as a basis for cross examination. The Judge cited \nto Applicant\u2019s answers to Department Counsel\u2019s questions, but she stated more than once that the \nsummary itself was not evidence. References to these documents in the Decision appear to have \nbeen for the purpose of providing context for Applicant\u2019s written statement or her testimony.  We \nfind no reason to believe that the Judge relied on the contents of the interview summaries contained \nin GE 2 and 7 in preparing her findings and conclusions. Indeed, the Judge ruled in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor concerning one SOR allegation for which the only evidence was contained in GE 7. We \nresolve this allegation adversely to Applicant. \nConstitutional Due Process   \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred insofar as she denied Applicant a clearance based \nsimply upon her sex life. Applicant argues that she has a due process right under the Constitution \nto engage in sexual relations with whomever she desires. Applicant \u201cdid not think she did anything \nwrong and had nothing to hide.\u201d Appeal Brief at 9. She contends that the Government did not \nestablish a compelling interest in examining her conduct and that the substance of security \nclearance decisions can, in fact, be justiciable in Federal Court. \nIt has long been the case that no one has a liberty or property interest in a security \nclearance.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nBecause there is a strong presumption against the issuance or continuation of a \nsecurity clearance, and because the availability of a security clearance depends on \nan affirmative act of discretion by the granting official, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d \nWhere there is no right, no process is due under the \nConstitution. [Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399 at 1403 (9th Cir. 1990), quoting \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 at 528 (1988), internal citations \nomitted.] \nNeither Egan or Dorfmont have been modified, much less overruled. Moreover, to the extent that \nApplicant is challenging the constitutionality of provisions of the Directive or other guidance \nbinding upon us, we have no jurisdiction to entertain such a challenge. Our jurisdiction is limited \nto those matters set forth in Directive \u204b E3.1.32. See ISCR Case No. 14-02383 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. \n21, 2015); ISCR Case No. 99-0457 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2001). Accordingly, we will construe \nApplicant\u2019s arguments as contending that the Judge erred in concluding that her conduct raised \nsecurity concerns and that the Judge was biased against Applicant. \nSecurity Concerns \nAll of the concerns raised in this case arose under Guideline E. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s \nargument, the decision did not rely solely upon Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior. The Judge also \nentered adverse findings regarding Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of her marijuana use in her \n2016 SCA.1 The Guideline E security concern is as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to . . . provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative . . . processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination [or] \nsecurity clearance action . . . refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other official representatives \nin connection with a personnel security . . . determination. [Directive, Encl. 2, App. \nA \u204b 15 (emphasis added).] \nApplicant does not deny on appeal that her omissions were deliberate. Indeed, she testified that \nshe omitted this misconduct in an effort to enhance her chances for a favorable clearance decision. \nTr. at 187-188. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s false statement in her \nSCA raised Guideline E concerns. \nMoreover, we find no reason to conclude that Applicant was denied a clearance simply due \nto her sexual conduct as such. To the contrary, the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was based upon \nconduct by Applicant that calls into question her judgment and much of which was criminal. For \n1 The Judge found against Applicant on the portion of the falsification allegation that asserts she deliberately failed \nto disclose her marijuana involvement on her 2016 SCA but found in favor of her on the portion that asserts she failed \nto disclose such involvement \u201cwhile possessing a security clearance.\u201d We find no merit in Applicant\u2019s contention that \nthose findings are inconsistent. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \nexample, she engaged in prostitution services about 25 times and advised during the post-test \ninterview following her second polygraph that the last time she accepted money for a sexual act \nwas 2015, referring most likely to her interaction with Man 2. \u201cAfter receiving the money, \n[Applicant] confirmed that she knew it was in exchange for sex. Therefore, she \u2018spent the $300 \nright away.\u2019\u201d \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) F, Decision Statement, at 4-5. \nMoreover, despite \nApplicant\u2019s claim that she had nothing to hide in her affair with Man 1, her own evidence discloses \nthat she felt \u201clike a sugar baby\u201d and \u201ca prostitute who took advantage of a man who was willing \nto help me.\u201d AE E, Post-Test Interview Summaries, at 3.  This evidence betrays an awareness of \nguilt and describes activity that could affect Applicant\u2019s community standing. See Directive, Encl. \n2, App. A \u204b 16(e), supra. All in all, the Judge\u2019s findings and the record evidence describe conduct \nthat casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  We find no error in the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that the conduct at issue in this case raised concerns under the disqualifying \nconditions set forth in the Analysis portion of the Decision.  \nBias \nWe have also considered Applicant\u2019s due process argument as a contention that the Judge \nlacked the requisite impartiality.  We have considered the entirety of the record, paying particular \nattention to the Judge\u2019s conduct of the hearing, and find nothing therein that would likely persuade \na reasonable person that she had an inflexible predisposition against Applicant. While Applicant \nmay be disappointed over the result of the case, adverse decisions in and of themselves do not \nevidence bias. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017). Applicant has \nnot met her heavy burden of persuasion on this matter. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02867 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nSex Trafficking \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred by failing to address 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422, which \ncriminalizes human trafficking. Applicant argues that she was, in fact, a victim of sex trafficking, \nin essence a crime victim, and that the Judge should have considered this matter in evaluating the \nextent that Applicant\u2019s conduct raised security concerns as well as in performing a credibility \ndetermination. \nDepartment Counsel notes that Applicant did not raise this issue at the hearing and argues \nthat by failing to do so, Applicant has forfeited it for purposes of appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02158 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019). We agree with Department Counsel that Applicant did \nnot address this issue below. As a consequence, the Judge had no reason to consider it. Indeed, \nfar from presenting herself as a trafficking victim, Applicant testified that she engaged in \nprostitution willingly. \n[Q]: And when you decided to become a prostitute, did you do that willingly? \n[A]: Yes, I did that \u2013 experimented in 2004 . . . \n[Q]: And were you forced to do it? \n[A]: No, I wasn\u2019t.  \n[Q]: Is that something that you wanted to do? \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n[A]: Well, I didn\u2019t do it for a very long time. Eventually I realized like, you know \nwhat, I really don\u2019t need to do it. But I was interested and \u2013 from a research \nperspective basically. Tr. at 115, 117.  \nIn addition, Applicant never suggested that her affair with Man 1 and her interactions with Man 2 \nwere other than consensual.  The Judge did not err by failing to address this matter in her analysis \nof the disqualifying conditions. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge should have considered the issue of human \ntrafficking in evaluating Applicant\u2019s truth and veracity, we give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations. Directive \u204b E3.1.32.1. The Judge\u2019s conclusions about Applicant\u2019s credibility were \nfounded in large measure on her inconsistent statements and other record evidence that impugned \nher believability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03778 at 3 (Aug. 4, 2017). Applicant\u2019s arguments \nare not sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s credibility determination. Accordingly, we conclude \nthat Applicant forfeited the issue of human trafficking by failing to have raised it at the hearing.  \nMoreover, even if not forfeited, this argument is not sufficient to show that the Judge committed \nerror in her analysis of Applicant\u2019s case. \nRemaining Issues \nApplicant argues that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence. Among other \nthings, she argues that the Judge failed to consider evidence that she had disclosed her marijuana \nuse in later SCAs and that AGA had given her a waiver to continue working pending the outcome \nof her clearance adjudication. After the hearing, Applicant submitted additional documentation, \nincluding her 2020 SCA, her appeal of the 2018 AGA security clearance denial, and email traffic \nshowing that AGA granted her an \u201cunclass work waiver.\u201d The Judge admitted these documents \nas AE DD. The Judge made findings to the effect that Applicant is currently working on a project \nfor AGA.  However, a Judge cannot be expected to discuss every piece of evidence, which would \nbe a virtual impossibility, especially in a voluminous record like this. Although the evidence \ncontained in AE DD has some relevance, it is not so compelling that a reasonable person would \nlikely expect a Judge to address it explicitly, given the overall weight of the record evidence. For \nexample, that AGA apparently has given Applicant a waiver to work on unclassified projects \npending the outcome of her clearance adjudication has little bearing on the question of whether the \nadjudication should yield a result favorable to Applicant. After considering the entirety of \nApplicant\u2019s appeal arguments, we conclude that she has not rebutted the presumption that the \nJudge considered all of the evidence in the record or demonstrated that the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s analysis of her case for mitigation. She contends, among \nother things, that she provided truthful information about her marijuana use in subsequent SCAs \nand during the course of interviews with security officials. However, we note that Applicant \nfinally disclosed the full extent of her marijuana use only in connection with her second polygraph \nexamination.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Q]: And so the only reason why we know about your marijuana use is because \nyou disclosed it in [2017]? . . . \n[A]: Yes, Your Honor.  \n[Q]: So that was 2017.  That\u2019s why we know about it? \n[A]: Yes, Your Honor. Tr. at 189. \nThis testimony and the documentary evidence underlying it qualify the extent to which Applicant \ncould be said to have promptly corrected her false statement before being confronted with it.  \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b 17(a). Although Applicant\u2019s most recent incident of security \nsignificant conduct occurred several years ago, the Judge\u2019s analysis of her case for mitigation \nfocused to a significant degree on Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility at the hearing. As stated above, \nthis credibility determination is consistent with the record that was before the Judge and supports \nher conclusion that Applicant had not met her burden of persuasion. All in all we find in \nApplicant\u2019s appeal arguments no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s analysis. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s \ncontentions, the Judge appears to have complied with the requirements of the Directive in that she \nevaluated Applicant\u2019s case in light of the entirety of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02925 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Egan, \nsupra, at 528. See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b): \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nOrder \nThe Decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for 2012-2015 \nin a timely manner; that he owed the Federal Government about $14,000 in unpaid taxes for 2012; \nand that he had six other delinquent debts.

Applicant worked overseas in 2012 and \n2013 and provided his wife a power of attorney for her to file their tax returns in his absence, but \nshe felt uncomfortable doing so. He filed his Federal tax returns for 2012-2015 in 2019. He owed \nunpaid Federal taxes for 2014 and 2015 and made payments towards those taxes in 2020. In late \n2020, he received an IRS notice of intent to seize property unless he paid about $2,300 for his 2015 \ntaxes. He made that payment in August 2021. \nAfter the DOHA hearing in November 2021, \nApplicant paid the IRS over $19,000 for his 2012 taxes, over $12,000 for his 2013 taxes, and about \n$600 for his 2020 taxes.  The Judge concluded: \nApplicant has a long history of financial irresponsibility. He has had debt \naccumulation and a history of avoidance of tax obligations to include an inability \nor unwillingness to comply with income tax filing requirements and payment of \ntaxes owed. \nHe has shown little concurrent effort to resolve his financial \nobligations until his security eligibility was in jeopardy. He has not submitted \nsufficient or persuasive evidence to show how his service overseas significantly \nimpeded his ability to file federal income tax returns and pay taxes as required.  \n[Decision at 6.] \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact but \nargues, \u201cHow the Judge finds there is a potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is \nnot stated.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. The Judge, however, made no finding or conclusion of that nature. \nApplicant contends the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, misapplied the \nmitigating conditions, mis-weighed the evidence, and erred in his whole-person assessment. None \nof Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered \nall of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03363 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. \n29, 2018). The Hearing Office cases that Applicant cites in support of his arguments are neither \nbinding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. Id. They \nare easily distinguishable from the present case and do not provide a reason to conclude the Judge \nerred in his analysis or conclusions. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

His security \nclearance was suspended in 2017, \u201cstem[ing] from his behavior during his [marital] separation and \neventual divorce.\u201d Id. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on two Guideline I allegations, five Guideline F \nallegations, one Guideline H allegation, and one Guideline E allegation. These guidelines are \naddressed separately below. Since the remaining Guideline E allegation merely cross-alleges the \nGuideline I allegations, they are addressed together.    \nGuidelines I & E  \nA formal diagnosis is not required to establish security concerns under Guideline I.  Since \n2009, Applicant has been treated for Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). His \ncurrent physician, who has treated him for about six years, believes he is stable. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s behavior does warrant consideration under this \nguideline absent any particular diagnosis. Between May 2016 and June 2017, \nApplicant shared details of his then estranged Wife\u2019s private and consensual sexual \nactivities and her romantic relationship with her new partner with numerous \ngovernment agencies and on the internet. He also disseminated sexually explicit \nphotographs of her to third parties and published them online. He also accused \nanother federal contracting employee and a flag officer of retaliation for publicly \nouting individuals involved in an alternative sexual lifestyle community. The \nrecord contains a sample of these writings, consisting of more than 300 pages. In \nthe 2019 psychological evaluation, the psychologist attributes Applicant\u2019s behavior \nto the emotional distress he experienced after this Wife left the marriage. The poor \njudgment and lack of discretion Applicant demonstrated was not the result of any \nparticular mental health condition.  [Decision at 19-20.] \nNonetheless, Applicant\u2019s behavior raises \u201cconcerns about his judgment, discretion, and mental \nstability.\u201d  Decision at 1.  \nGuideline F \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for \n2010-2018 as required. As of the close of the record, Applicant provided documentation that he \nfiled his Federal income tax returns for 2010-2015, 2017, and 2018 beyond the deadlines. A \nnumber of those returns were filed late by over two years. He did not provide proof that he filed \nhis 2016 Federal income tax return. Applicant provided proof that he filed his state income tax \nreturns for 2010-2018. For 2010 to 2015, his state returns were generally filed late by over two \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyears. His proof of filing state returns for 2016-2018 consisted of state tax documents showing he \nreceived refunds for those years. Applicant attributed his tax filing deficiencies to receiving advice \nfrom a tax professional that he had three years to file the returns to claim the refunds and believing \nhe was entitled to refunds for each year. In this regard, the Judge concluded, \u201cIt is unlikely that a \ntax professional advised Applicant that receiving a refund changed his filing obligations under \nstate and federal law.\u201d  Decision at 18.  \nGuideline H \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2010 to 2015 \nwhile holding a security clearance. In a 2018 security clearance application, he disclosed that he \nused marijuana \u201cmaybe 3 times total over the past seven years.\u201d Decision at 5, quoting from GE \n1 at 47. He also disclosed he used it while holding a security clearance. When questioned at the \nhearing about his history of marijuana use, he provided evasive answers.  He stated the number of \ntimes he used marijuana \u201ccould also be zero[,]\u201d but also acknowledged he tried marijuana while \nholding a security clearance. Decision at 6, citing Tr. at 77-79. Applicant indicated that he had \nno intent to use marijuana in the future, submitted a signed statement of intent to that effect, stated \nhe no longer associates with people who use illegal drugs, and provided the results of a negative \ndrug test. Noting that Applicant provided conflicting information about the circumstances of his \ndrug use, the Judge concluded Applicant\u2019s promise to abstain from illegal drugs use in the future \nlacks credibility. While some mitigating conditions partially apply, he did not mitigate the security \nconcerns.  \nWhole-Person Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s behavior demonstrates an: \ninability to recognize personal and professional boundaries as well as a profound \nlack of discretion. In his anger and emotional distress, Applicant abandoned this \nprinciple to such an extent that he cast doubt on his ongoing security worthiness.  \nHe showed disrespect for the personal privacy of others, invading it whenever he \nfelt justified. He handled his own private information and that of others with such \nreckless disregard that he raised serious concerns that he would handle and \nsafeguard classified information in the same manner. This negative whole-person \nassessment is not mitigated by his years of having access to classified information \nwithout incident, or the favorable character information in the record.  Applicant\u2019s \nactions demonstrated that he lacks good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness \nrequired of those granted access to classified information.  [Decision at 21.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, misapplied the mitigating \nconditions, misweighed the evidence, and erred in her whole-person assessment. Regarding these \nchallenges, it merits noting that the weighing of evidence is a matter within the special province \nof the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00857 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2019). Furthermore, there \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence, and the appealing \nparty has a heavy burden when trying to rebut that presumption. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18\u00ad\n00110 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). The standard used to review challenges to the Judge\u2019s \nanalysis\u2e3aincluding the application of the guidelines, the weighing of the evidence, or the drawing \nof conclusions\u2e3ais whether those determinations are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32. The \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard is highly deferential. See, e.g., AT&T \nCorp. v. FCC, 220 F.3d 607, 616 (D.C. Cir. 2000). \nIn his brief, Applicant argues the Judge erred in concluding \u201cthe record does not contain \nany information to mitigate the concerns raised by [Applicant\u2019s] behavior.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7, \nquoting from Decision at 20 (Judge\u2019s analysis). In reviewing a challenged word, phrase, or \nsentence in a Judge\u2019s decision, the Board does not examine it in isolation. Rather, we consider \nsuch challenges in light of the decision in its entirety. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02181 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2019). In this case, the Judge\u2019s decision contains 13 pages of findings of fact. \nIn those findings, the Judge discusses the mitigating evidence that Applicant presented, much of \nwhich pertained to the Guideline I and E allegations. This evidence included Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations for why he engaged in the alleged conduct, descriptions of corroborating \ndocumentation, a letter from his treating psychiatrist that indicated he was \u201cstable\u201d (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AE) A), and a favorable psychological evaluation conducted by a licensed clinical social \nworker in 2021 (AE H and Z). \nFurthermore, regarding the Government\u2019s psychological \nevaluation, the Judge found that, while the psychologist indicated Applicant\u2019s behavior \ndemonstrated poor judgment, she also noted the psychologist ultimately concluded \u201cin the future, \nit is questionable whether this individual\u2019s emotional distress will continue to impair his judgment \nas it has done in the relatively recent past.\u201d Decision at 13, quoting from Government Exhibit 2. \nBased on our review of the record, we interpret the Judge\u2019s challenged comment not to mean that \nApplicant did not submit any mitigating evidence regarding the Guideline I and E allegations, but \nrather to denote the evidence he submitted was insufficient to mitigate the alleged security \nconcerns.  We find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s adverse findings under Guidelines I and E.  \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that aspects of his testimony were not \ncredible. We are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1. Applicant has not established any reason for the Board not to give such deference in \nthis case. Applicant\u2019s brief also highlights various aspects of the mitigating evidence, such as the \npassage of time since the alleged conduct, and argues the Judge erred in concluding the security \nconcerns were not mitigated. As the Board has noted in the past, an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or \nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016). In short, none of Applicant\u2019s arguments are \nsufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to \ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s analysis of the evidence contravened the requirements of the Directive.    \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

This appears to have resulted merely from oversight and has not been raised as an issue \non appeal. We simply point out that Judges are required to address all of the allegations in a SOR. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.25; see also ISCR Case No. 08-07803 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). \nThe Judge found that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns from \n2012 until 2016; that he owed the IRS just under $700,000; and that he owed his state taxing \nauthority about $260,000. The Judge also found Applicant\u2019s explanations for his problems to be \ninconsistent. Federal and state authorities issued levies against Applicant\u2019s income in satisfaction \nof his tax delinquencies, but Applicant himself did not engage in formal efforts to resolve his \nproblems until after he had been served with interrogatories.  Applicant cited to no circumstances \nbeyond his control that impaired his ability to file returns and pay taxes. The Judge concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s track record regarding his tax obligations \u201cis extremely poor at best.\u201d Decision at 12. \nApplicant\u2019s brief includes information from outside the record, which we cannot consider. \nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29 (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d). \nApplicant cites to his having held a clearance for many years without incident or concern. \nThe Judge made findings about Applicant\u2019s clearance history, his military service, and the \nfavorable character references attesting to his excellent work record and his trustworthiness. \nHowever, the government need not wait until an individual mishandles or fails to safeguard \nclassified information before it can make an unfavorable security clearance decision. Even those \nwith good prior records can encounter circumstances in which their judgment and reliability might \nbe brought into question. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). Indeed, \npersons who fail to abide by legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax obligations \nwhen due, may be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). Applicant has not rebutted the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

Moreover, in his decision, the Judge thoroughly explored all mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F before concluding that none apply. His findings of fact are amply \nsupported by the record. His analysis and conclusions are firmly grounded in the appeal board \nprecedent to which he cites. As the Judge noted in his decision, even if a debt has been rendered \nuncollectable due to a statute of limitation, a judge may still consider the underlying circumstances \nof an applicant\u2019s financial difficulties in evaluating whether he or she demonstrated good \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 6, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On January 24, \n2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged nine delinquent consumer accounts that totaled \napproximately $28,000. The Judge found for Applicant on one minor debt and against Applicant \non the remaining eight allegations. Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in his findings of fact, \nthat he improperly relied upon evidence that was not admitted, and that his delinquent debts have \nbeen mitigated by the passage of time, in that collection is now barred by the statute of limitations.  \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s factual findings are summarized below, in \npertinent part: \nApplicant is 43 years old. He has one child from his first marriage, which ended in divorce \nin 2014. He has a job offer from a defense contractor, which is contingent upon a security \nclearance. He is currently attending college online and is a few months away from earning a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. \nApplicant was born overseas, immigrated to the United States in 2003, and became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2011. His first wife is also from his country of origin. Applicant and his first wife owned \na business from 2005 to 2014 that ultimately failed. Applicant had a low-paying job at a bank \nfrom early 2013 until early 2014.  In 2014, Applicant and his ex-wife decided that the best option \nwas for Applicant to return to his country of origin with the child while his ex-wife completed her \ndegree in the United States, as Applicant had financial problems resulting from the failure of his \nbusiness, his divorce, and his inability to find a better-paying job. When his ex-wife completed \nher degree in 2017, Applicant came with the child to the United States, left the child with his ex-\nwife, and returned to his country of origin where he still lives. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the debts, with the exception of a $145 \ndebt that he successfully disputed with Experian in 2018. Of the remaining eight debts, seven \nbecame delinquent between 2013 and 2014 and no longer appear on the recent credit reports \nsubmitted by the Government. The eighth debt became delinquent in 2015; the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports confirm that it too will fall off all reports by early 2022.  \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. His second wife has a job in \ncountry of origin, but earns a low salary. Applicant is focused on finishing his education in order \nto obtain a better job upon his return to the United States and will pay his debts when he has the \nmeans to do so. To finance his online education, Applicant has taken out about $60,000 in student \nloans, which are currently deferred. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below, in pertinent part: \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to the failure of his and his ex-wife\u2019s \nbusiness, his divorce, and his inability to find a better-paying job than the one he \nhad before he quit in 2014. . . . His long term plan is to obtain his bachelor\u2019s degree, \nreturn to the United States, get a good job, bring his [current] wife to the United \nStates, and pay his debts once he has the means to do so. . . . Applicant does not \nhave a track record that would enable me to project with any degree of certainty \nthat he will complete his long-term plan and pay his debts. . . . There is insufficient \nevidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved \nwithin a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that he made a good faith effort to pay his debts.

Applicant asserts that his ex-wife was the \nowner of the business and cites to Applicant Exhibit (AE) 26, their joint Federal tax return for \n2013, for corroboration. Applicant speculates that the Judge obtained the erroneous information \nfrom Government Exhibit (GE) 2, the summary of Applicant\u2019s clearance interview, which \nApplicant objected to and which the Judge did not admit. Applicant asserts that this error was \nprejudicial in several regards: \nThese erroneous findings and analysis based on non-existent information likely \ncontributed materially and negatively towards his assessment of mitigating factors, \nand the whole person concept analysis. The likely review of evidence that was \nsuccessfully objected and excluded from the record is also contrary to law. I \nstrongly feel that excluded item would have had a negative influence on the judge\u2019s \ndecision and has effectively violated my rights in this case.  [Appeal Brief at 2.] \nHowever, our review of the record indicates that the Judge\u2019s misunderstanding as to ownership of \nthe business was based upon properly admitted evidence and testimony at the hearing, and not \nupon any improper consideration of GE 2.  Moreover, we conclude that any error was harmless. \nAs Applicant asserts, Schedule C of the couple\u2019s 2013 joint Federal tax return establishes \nthat his wife owned a travel agency and that it was not jointly owned. AE 26 at 5. However, the \nSchedule C is the only evidence of ownership in the documents of record, and the matter of \nownership of the business was neither in issue nor discussed at Applicant\u2019s hearing. Other \ndocuments, however, give rise to a reasonable interpretation that Applicant was a joint owner.  \nMost importantly, in his security clearance application (SF86) of September 2018, Applicant \nreported his employment for 2005 through 2014 to be \u201cSelf-employment\u201d as manager of the travel \nagency.  GE 1 at 22. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s joint Federal tax return for 2013 indicated household \nincome from the business in the amount of approximately $25,000. AE 26 at 1. His Federal \nreturns for subsequent years indicate no income from that business. In his testimony, Applicant \nstated repeatedly that his debts became delinquent in 2014 \u201cdue to the divorce and severe loss of \nincome.\u201d Tr. at 29, 30, 31. Taken together, this evidence of record contains ample indicia for the \nJudge to conclude that Applicant was a co-owner of the travel agency business and that the \nbusiness faltered in 2014. \nConversely, and contrary to Applicant\u2019s speculation, the summary of his clearance \ninterview is not a likely source of the Judge\u2019s misunderstanding, as GE 2 states clearly that \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife owned the travel business: \nIn 2012, [Applicant] and his wife began having financial difficulties because the \ntravel agency business his wife was operating began falling off because of the \nhousing market bust . . . . In 2011 the subject and his wife began experiencing \nfinancial difficulties because the subject\u2019s wife had a travel agency business that \nbegan declining because of the housing market bust.

Moreover, we find any error harmless, \nas it did not likely have an impact on the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). We are not persuaded by Applicant\u2019s argument that this nuanced \nmisunderstanding (i.e., his loss of income was due to the divorce and loss of spousal income rather \nthan to a failure of the couple\u2019s business) could have in any way affected the Judge\u2019s assessment \nof mitigating factors or his whole person analysis. \nApplicant also argues that his debts are mitigated by the passage of time, as the statute of \nlimitations has run, thereby \u201celiminating the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. First, the Board has repeatedly noted that reliance on a statute of \nlimitations does not constitute a good faith effort to resolve financial difficulties. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005). Second, even if debts have been rendered \nuncollectable due to a statute of limitations, a judge may still consider the underlying \ncircumstances of an applicant\u2019s financial difficulties in evaluating whether he has demonstrated \ngood judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMar. 27, 2003). Finally, Guideline F security clearance decisions are not limited to consideration \nof whether an applicant is vulnerable to coercion or blackmail. Those concerns also encompass \nthe risk that applicants who are financially irresponsible might also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nor negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16\u00ad\n04112 at 4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019). \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

In 2010, Applicant received a two-year appointment as a student trainee at a Federal agency. If he successfully completed the internship, he would be eligible to be hired fulltime. During a conversation at an off-site party in mid-2011, Applicant and his fellow interns discussed the upcoming visit of the President of the United States to a local college. Applicant purportedly stated security at the college would not be adequate to protect the President because there were multiple ways that homemade bombs could be used against him. Using his laptop computer, Applicant proceeded to show the interns a manual on how to make explosives. Base police where Applicant worked were notified of his comments and initiated an investigation.1 The U.S. Secret Service was also notified of the incident. Applicant agreed to a forensic examination of his laptop computer. The investigation concluded that no threats or other criminal violations occurred, and the case was closed. In late 2011, Applicant emailed his supervisor about work opportunities during his school\u2019s holiday break.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nJames B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nTroy L. Nussbaum, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 18, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. The SOR was amended both at the hearing and again \nafter submission of post-hearing evidence. On March 28, 2022, after the record closed, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline I, the SOR alleged, as amended, that a licensed psychologist diagnosed \nApplicant with mental health disorders in December 2021; indicated he has not received \nappropriate treatment; determined his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are questionable; \n1 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nand gave him a guarded prognosis. Under Guideline E, it alleged, as amended, that Applicant was \nterminated from a job in 2011 for conducting himself in an inappropriate manner by making \ncomments that caused other employees to feel uncomfortable and that he falsified responses in a \n2017 security clearance application and a 2020 background interview. On appeal, Department \nCounsel does not challenge the Judge\u2019s favorable falsification findings but contends the other \nfavorable findings are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we \nreverse. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his early thirties, is single, and has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has worked for \na defense contractor since 2017. \nIn 2010, Applicant received a two-year appointment as a student trainee at a Federal \nagency. If he successfully completed the internship, he would be eligible to be hired fulltime. \nDuring a conversation at an off-site party in mid-2011, Applicant and his fellow interns discussed \nthe upcoming visit of the President of the United States to a local college. Applicant purportedly \nstated security at the college would not be adequate to protect the President because there were \nmultiple ways that homemade bombs could be used against him. Using his laptop computer, \nApplicant proceeded to show the interns a manual on how to make explosives.  \nBase police where Applicant worked were notified of his comments and initiated an \ninvestigation.1 The U.S. Secret Service was also notified of the incident. Applicant agreed to a \nforensic examination of his laptop computer. The investigation concluded that no threats or other \ncriminal violations occurred, and the case was closed. In late 2011, Applicant emailed his \nsupervisor about work opportunities during his school\u2019s holiday break. The supervisor responded \nthere would not be any work for him this winter, and he would not be able to bring him back in \nthe future.  Applicant received a closeout packet with instructions on transferring his thrift saving \nplan and returning his common access card. The supervisor also called Applicant but did not give \nhim reason to believe he was terminated from his internship for cause or for any reason other than \nlack of work. During a background interview about six years later, Applicant was confronted \nabout being terminated from the internship for making inappropriate comments that caused other \nemployees to feel uncomfortable. Applicant denied that assertion, claiming he did not recall \nmaking inappropriate comments to coworkers and never received follow-up correspondence \nsetting forth the reason why his internship ended. Since then, he has learned the comments that \nresulted in the investigation contributed to his termination. The Government introduced a \ntermination letter that referenced inappropriate comments, but the receipt block on that letter is \nunsigned and undated. \nDuring the clearance adjudication process, Applicant has undergone four mental health \nevaluations. These include evaluations by three licensed psychologists and one licensed clinical \nsocial worker. Two years before the hearing, the first evaluation was conducted by a licensed \npsychologist at DoD\u2019s request. At the hearing, this psychologist testified that \u201ca lot can change \npsychologically in two years.\u201d Decision at 5, quoting from Tr. at 43. Post-hearing, two other \nlicensed psychologists evaluated Applicant. One evaluation was conducted at Applicant\u2019s request \n1 The investigation was conducted by Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), not the base police. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(hereinafter referred to as either AE 7 or Psychological Evaluation #3) and the other at the DoD\u2019s \nrequest (hereinafter referred to as either GE 7 or Psychological Evaluation #4).2 \nPsychological Evaluation #3 was a three-day assessment. It reflects that Applicant was \ndiagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. \nThe psychologist \nrecommended that he participate in weekly individual therapy for managing depressive episodes \nand in role playing or practicing conversational skills.   \nPsychological Evaluation #4 reflects that Applicant was diagnosed with \u201cSocial \npragmatic communication disorder vs. autism spectrum disorder; Bipolar II disorder . . . ; and \nUnspecified anxiety disorder. (GE 7 at 6)\u201d Decision at 5. It further stated that Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are questionable, that he posed a risk to national security \nif granted a security clearance, and that his prognosis was guarded. Id., citing GE 7 at 6. \u201cIn \nreaching this conclusion, [the psychologist] relied, in part, on controverted allegations, not \nincluded in the SOR, from unidentified coworkers on a job where he worked more than ten years \nago. Moreover, her report does not reflect the conclusion of the base police investigation because \nshe never received it.\u201d Id. Post-hearing the Guideline I allegation was amended to reflect the \nresults of Psychological Evaluation #4. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe Guideline E allegation regarding Applicant\u2019s job termination is defective because it \ndoes not specify the purported inappropriate conduct or comments at issue, and the Government \nfailed to identify the individuals who made these complaints and make them available for cross-\nexamination. Even if this allegation was tenable, it is mitigated because the information is \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability. \nPsychological Evaluation #4 is of limited probative value because it relied, in part, on \ncontroverted allegations from unidentified coworkers from over ten years ago that were not alleged \nin the SOR and does not reflect the conclusions of the base police investigation. Applicant has no \nrecord of concerning incidents since working at this current job since 2017. He is well respected \nby his colleagues and clients. He acknowledges his mental health disorder and is in therapy to \naddress this issue. Mitigating Condition 29(e), there is no indication of a current problem, applies. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted \nor proven facts. The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \n2 The psychologist who prepared Psychological Evaluation #4 reviewed a copy of Psychological Evaluation #3 before \npreparing her report. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, \n2015). \nReply Brief \nBecause Applicant raises a threshold issue in his reply brief, it is addressed first. He argues \nthat Department Counsel\u2019s appeal brief should be stricken for failure to comply with Appeal Board \nguidance, i.e., the Board\u2019s handout on \u201cAppeals of Judge\u2019s Decisions under DoD Directive \n5220.6,\u201d which is provided to the parties and is also available on the DOHA website (see Appeal \nInstructions under Industrial Security Program at https://doha.ogc.mil). \nMore specifically, \nApplicant contends that Department Counsel\u2019s brief fails to contain his social security number, \nmailing address, and his counsel\u2019s mailing address and that Department Counsel did not serve him \nwith a copy of her brief. Regarding the latter assertion, we note that Department Counsel provided \nthe Appeal Board with the original and a copy of her brief, and the Board then mailed to \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel the copy of her brief. Over the years, this procedure has developed into a \nroutine practice because it enables the Board to determine when the non-appealing party receives \nthe appeal brief, which, in turn, establishes the 20-day reply brief filing deadline. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.30. In short, Applicant\u2019s arguments to strike Department Counsel\u2019s appeal brief are based \non procedural technicalities, and his arguments fail to establish any error meriting relief. We \nresolve this assignment of error adversely to Applicant.  \nGuideline E Allegation \nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the Guideline E allegation \npertaining to Applicant\u2019s internship termination was flawed.  We agree with this contention. \nIn his analysis, the Judge concluded this SOR allegation was problematic for two reasons. \nHe stated, \nFirst, although SOR allegations do not have to be drafted with the specificity of \ncriminal pleading, they must, at a minimum, be drafted in such a manner that the \napplicant can prepare a response. (ISCR Case No. 00-0633.a1 (October [24], 2003) \nat [3-5]) Subparagraph 2.a does not meet this threshold because it does not specify \nthe allegedly inappropriate conduct or comments at issue.  [Decision at 7.] \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s Counsel raised no motion or objection challenging the legal \nsufficiency of this amended SOR allegation.

During his opening statement, Applicant\u2019s Counsel stated \nApplicant was aware that he was terminated from the internship for inappropriate comments. Tr. \nat 70. Furthermore, Applicant testified that, since his background interview in 2017, he was aware \nthe inappropriate conduct at issue involved his comments about explosives, the President\u2019s \nsecurity, and bomb-making literature at the offsite party. Tr. at 94-99, 109-111, 118-122, and 124\u00ad\n128. \nWhen his counsel specifically asked him whether the allegation concerning his job \ntermination for making inappropriate comments was accurate, Applicant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Tr. at \n109-110. From his testimony, it is clear Applicant was aware that his internship termination was \nbased at least in part on the matters NCIS investigated. Given the facts of this case, the Judge \nerred in concluding that Applicant was not adequately placed on notice of the conduct at issue. 4 \nThe Judge also stated this SOR allegation was problematic because the Government must \nidentify the witnesses who reported the inappropriate comments and make them available for \ncross-examination. In support of that proposition, the Judge cites Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22 and ISCR \nCase No 05-10921 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2007). Based on our review of that cited Appeal Board \ndecision, we conclude it provides no support for the Judge\u2019s position on this issue. Quite to the \ncontrary, the Appeal Board has held that Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22 does not provide a right of cross-\nexamination concerning out-of-hearing statements that are admissible under other provisions of \nthe Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12461 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2013). In the present \ncase, each of the relevant Government Exhibits (GE)\u2e3ahis adopted personal subject interview (GE \n2), the two psychologist\u2019s evaluations (GE 3 and 7), the NCIS report (GE 4), and the Government \ntermination letter (GE 5)\u2e3aare admissible into evidence under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 without \nauthenticating witnesses. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01755 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2019). The \nJudge erred in concluding the Government must identify and make available the individuals who \nreported the inappropriate conduct reflected in those exhibits. \nFinally, the Judge concluded that, assuming the allegation is tenable, the security concerns \narising from it are mitigated under Mitigating Condition 17(f), \u201cthe information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d Decision at 8. This conclusion is \nsimply unsustainable in light of the fact that Applicant admitted the amended allegation. \nIn his reply brief, Applicant argues the Judge\u2019s favorable finding regarding this allegation \nis correct even if his reasoning was not. Reply Brief at 8. Applicant argues the conduct at issue \nwas mitigated due to the passage of time, highlighting his good work performance since 2011. \nThose were factors the Judge should have considered in his mitigation analysis, but he failed to do \n3 An unequivocal admission by an applicant\u2019s counsel is binding on his or her client. See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. \n87-0955 at 4, n.3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 1989). \n4 \u201cAn SOR must give an applicant adequate notice of the reasons why the government proposes to deny or revoke \naccess to classified information so the applicant has a reasonable opportunity to respond to the SOR allegation and to \npresent a defense to the government\u2019s case against him or her. . . . Accordingly, as long as there is fair notice to the \naffected party and the affected party has a reasonable opportunity to respond, a case should be adjudicated on the \nmerits of relevant issues and should not be concerned with pleading niceties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003). An SOR does not have to allege every relevant fact. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08255 at 3 (App. \nBd.

In \napparently referring to Psychological Evaluation #4, the Judge stated: \nIn reaching this conclusion, the psychologist relied, in part, on controverted \nallegations, not alleged in the SOR, from unidentified coworkers on a job where \nApplicant worked more than ten years ago. Moreover, her report does not reflect \nthe conclusion of the base police investigation because she never received it. \nConsequently, the probative value of the report is limited. \nApplicant has been working for the same employer since 2017. There is no \nrecord of any negative job history in that time, and he is, in fact, well-respected by \nhis colleagues and clients. Applicant acknowledges that he has a mental health \ndisorder and is in ongoing therapy to address this issue. Under these circumstances, \nthe mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 29(e), \u201cthere is no indication of a current \nproblem,\u201d applies.  [Decision at 9.] \nRegarding the Judge\u2019s comments about \u201ccontroverted allegations,\u201d it is unclear what he is \nreferring to. Again, Applicant admitted making comments that resulted in the NCIS investigation \nand admitted engaging in inappropriate conduct. Furthermore, a psychological evaluation is not \ninvalidated because it is based, in part, on \u201ccontroverted facts, not alleged in the SOR.\u201d It is fair \nto say that psychological evaluations are often based on facts that an examinee may dispute or that \nare not alleged in an SOR. Additionally, the psychologist who prepared Psychological Evaluation \n#4 appears to have had a copy of the NCIS report (GE 4). She reported she reviewed the \n\u201cinvestigative results report\u201d and referenced the \u201cNCIS report\u201d in her evaluation.6 GE 7 at 1, 3, 4. \nWe recognize the weighing of the evidence is the special province of the trier of fact. Nonetheless, \nbased on the matters discussed below, the Judge has failed to set forth a reasonable basis for \nconcluding Psychological Evaluation #4 is of limited probative value. \nIn late 2021, two psychologists evaluated Applicant. AE L (Psychologist Evaluation #3) \nand GE 7 (Psychological Evaluation #4). Both psychologists reached quite similar diagnoses.   \nBoth diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar II Disorder and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. GE 7 \nfurther reflects that Applicant was diagnosed with Social Pragmatic Communication Disorder. AE \nL does not contain this latter diagnosis, but it does recommend that Applicant receive help to \n\u201cdevelop more comfort in social situations by role-playing and practicing conversational skills.\u201d  \nAE L at 8.  GE 7 concludes with the following paragraph: \n5 In his whole-person analysis, the Judge does mention that Applicant\u2019s job termination and the surrounding \ncircumstances occurred more than ten years ago. \n6 The psychologist indicated \u201cthe full results of the NCIS report were not available for review.\u201d GE 7 at 4.

His \nmental health treatment, to date, has certainly not been sufficient to address any \npotential underlying cause for his prior dialogues of inappropriate material leading \nto rather severe concerns from coworkers and an NCIS investigation. Therefore, \nhis judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are questionable. He has not had \nappropriate treatment for any of the potential conditions apparent from the available \nhistory and this evaluation (to include mood disorder, autism spectrum disorder or \notherwise). Therefore, he does pose a risk to national security if he possesses a \nsecurity clearance.  His prognosis is guarded, given his lengthy history concerning \ninteractions with others and the noted PAI [Personal Assessment Inventory] scale \nindicating minimal interest in therapy, as well as the lack of mental health treatment \nto date. [GE 7 at 6.] \nAlthough AE L does not directly address whether Applicant\u2019s mental health disorders have an \nimpact on his security clearance eligibility, it states: \n[Applicant] may be unwilling to self-examine his role in difficult situations of \nprolonged distress and may react externally by behaving erratically. [Applicant] \nmay be easily vivacious, animated, and enthusiastic as he is quickly angered or \nbored. . . . [T]here is strong suggestion of hypomanic episodes. During these \nperiods, he exhibits an erratic sequence of restlessness and excitability that may be \naccompanied by hostile behavior. He is likely to be talkative, distractible, subject \nto tantrums, and interpersonally disruptive. If provoked, he may explode in angry \noutbursts.  [AE L at 6.] \nThis assessment raises serious questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The Judge erred in failing to address those comments in his findings of fact and \nin failing to factor them into his analysis. Those comments undercut the Judge\u2019s ultimate \nconclusion that \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem.\u201d Decision at 9. \nDepartment Counsel also challenges the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant is \u201cin \nongoing therapy\u201d to address his mental health disorders.\u201d  Decision at 9. She argues persuasively \nthat there is no evidence that Applicant has received meaningful therapy by highlighting the \nfollowing: \n\uf0b7 Psychological Evaluation #1 reflects that Applicant \u201cdenied any history of mental \nhealth treatment or hospitalizations\u201d and also stated, \u201cI don\u2019t need a therapist or \nanything like that.\u201d GE 3 at 3. \n\uf0b7 Psychological Evaluation #2 reflects Applicant was tested for Attention Deficit \nDisorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder while attending college, was \ndirected to see a psychologist and engage in rigorous testing, but \u201cnothing happened \nafter that[.]\u201d AE A at 3.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\uf0b7 Psychological Evaluation #3 reflects that Applicant \u201clargely denied any prior \nhistory of mental health treatment\u201d and recommends he \u201cparticipate in weekly \nindividual therapy that focuses on building awareness of his affective/behavioral \ncycles, reducing anxiety, and mitigating depressive episodes.\u201d AE L at 2 and 8. \n\uf0b7 Psychological Evaluation #4 reflects that Applicant \"had no mental health history \nuntil he enrolled in therapy recently[,]\u201d that his counseling ended after three therapy \nsessions because his counselor moved to another state, and that, as noted above, his \nmental health treatment certainly has not been sufficient to address any of the \npotential underlying causes of his problematic behavior.  GE 7 at 3, 4, and 6. \n\uf0b7 When asked at the hearing how often he was meeting with a therapist and counselor, \nApplicant testified, \u201cit will be once a week when I resume with the new therapist \nnext month . . . .\u201d  Tr. at 103 (emphasis added). \nConclusion \nConsidering the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and \ncapricious. It is not sustainable because it fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs \ncontrary to the weight of the record evidence.

On September 15, 2022, the Board forwarded to Department Counsel a copy of AE H, \nprovided them an opportunity to object to it, and authorized them to amend their appeal brief \naccordingly.  In an amended appeal brief, Department Counsel raised no objection to AE H being \nadmitted into evidence.  \nIn the amended appeal brief, Department Counsel raise the following issue: whether the \nJudge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his thirties, married in 2020 and has an infant child.  In mid-2019, he \npled no contest to a charge of exposure of sexual organ and received a suspended imposition of \nsentence that placed him on probation for six months, ordered him to stay away from the location \nof the offense and to have no contact with the victims, and directed him to continue counseling.  \nThis offense occurred in mid-2018 when Applicant, while standing outside a campus cafeteria, \nexposed his genitals through a window to people inside that facility. The next morning there was \na news story about the incident. At that point, Applicant called the police, informed them that he \nwas the person of interest in the news story, and met with a detective. As a result of this incident, \nhe was terminated from his job.  He successfully completed his probation in late 2019. \nThe same month as the exposure offense, Applicant voluntarily sought the services of a \nlicensed psychologist, and they met for 25 sessions between 2018 and 2019. The psychologist \ndiagnosed and treated Applicant for Major Depressive Disorder and Exhibitionist Disorder. The \npsychologist concluded that \u201cthe Exhibitionist Disorder is in full remission at this time, as he \u2018has \nnot acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment \nin social, occupational or other areas of functioning\u2019 [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, Fifth Edition] since 2018.\u201d Decision at 5, quoting from Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) E. \nThey agreed to recurring psychotherapy services for the foreseeable future to assist Applicant with \nongoing mental health issues. \nIn early 2019, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in which he \ndisclosed the indecent exposure incident. In a subsequent background interview and at the hearing, \nApplicant disclosed he engaged in prior indecent exposure incidents (about four to five) in which \nhe flashed primarily young women. These other incidents occurred between 2015 and 2018. He \nengaged in that conduct to gratify his sexual desires. At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that \nhe still had thoughts about exposing himself, but he has blocked those thoughts and urges. \nIn his analysis, the Judge concluded disqualifying conditions under Guidelines D, E, and J \nwere established, but the security concerns arising under those guidelines were mitigated. In \nreaching that latter conclusion, the Judge emphasized that Applicant self-reported the mid-2018 \nincident to the police, his employer, and his family; that he sought and received professional mental \nhealth treatment; that a licensed psychologist concluded his Exhibitionist Disorder is in full \nremission; and that Applicant\u2019s non-alleged Major Depressive Disorder seems to be controlled by \nprescribed medication. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThere is no presumption of error below. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.19-01689 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJun. 8, 2020). The appealing party has the burden of raising and establishing the Judge committed \nfactual or legal error that is prejudicial. Id. On appeal, Department Counsel\u2019s principal argument \nis that the Judge\u2019s decision \u201creflects a piecemeal analysis and is arbitrary, capricious and contrary \nto law, and unsupported by any reasonable reading of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 11. We do not find Department Counsel\u2019s arguments persuasive. \nDepartment Counsel have not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. They \ndo, however, assert that \u201c[c]ontrary to the findings in the Remand Decision, there was no evidence \nin the record that Applicant was again taking prescription medications for his mental health.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 8. Regarding this issue, the Judge found, \u201c[f]rom December 2018 until about June \n2019, Applicant\u2019s physician prescribed Escitalopram (commonly called Lexapro) to treat his major \ndepressive disorder, single episode, unspecified.\u201d Decision at 6, citing AE F. Contrary to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s interpretation, we do not read the Judge\u2019s challenged conclusion (i.e., \u201cthat \ndisorder [major depression] seems to be controlled by prescription medication\u201d (Decision at 9)) as \nindicating Applicant was still taking a prescription medication for that condition. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s brief asserts that Applicant testified that he continues to have \nthoughts and urges to engage in acts of exhibitionism. The Judge, however, addressed this issue \nby concluding, \u201c[w]hile Applicant has not exposed himself since the July 2018 incident \u2013 now four \nyears ago \u2013 he did acknowledge that he has had thoughts about doing so, but he has successfully \nblocked thoughts and urges.\u201d Decision at 6, citing Tr. at 35-36, 46, 50. Department Counsel have \nnot shown the Judge committed prejudicial error in reaching that conclusion. \nDepartment Counsel challenge the Judge\u2019s apparent favorable credibility determination by \npointing out that Applicant indicated during his background interview that he exposed himself on \n\u201cat least 3 prior instances\u201d (Government Exhibit 2 at 5), while at the hearing he testified he did so \n\u201cabout four or five times.\u201d Tr. at 26. While these statements are not identical, they are not \ninconsistent. Furthermore, as the Board has previously stated, evidence of a witness making \ninconsistent statements about an issue does not, as a matter of law, require the Judge to find he or \nshe was not credible on other matters pertaining to the case. See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 92\u00ad\n0447 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 5, 1993). The fact that Applicant admitted to still having thoughts about \nexposing himself was a factor the Judge could consider in assessing his credibility. We find no \nreason not to give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determination. \nIn the appeal brief, Department Counsel contend the Judge \u201cfailed to address the actual \nconduct and Applicant\u2019s judgment.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12-13. The Judge, however, made specific \nfindings about Applicant\u2019s indecent exposure conduct, including that such conduct resulted in \nApplicant being terminated from a job and in him receiving a suspended imposition of sentence \nduring a criminal prosecution. In analyzing this case, the Judge concluded various disqualifying \nconditions under Guidelines D, E, and J were applicable to the alleged conduct. Department \nCounsel have failed to show the Judge did not consider important aspects of the case. Additionally, \nDepartment Counsel argue \u201cthis case focuses on Applicant\u2019s sexual and criminal conduct and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment, not a specific mental health diagnosis[,]\u201d but the next sentence undercuts this argument \nby acknowledging that \u201cApplicant\u2019s mental health is part-and-parcel of the allegations[.]\u201d Id.at \n13, emphasis in original. In general, Department Counsel\u2019s arguments appear to boil down to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. A party\u2019s ability to argue for an \nalternative interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate error. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nIn short, Department Counsel failed to establish the Judge committed harmful error. None \nof their arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record \nevidence or sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Id. The Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable on the record.  \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F.

On \nOctober 23, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline M (Use \nof Information Technology), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On \nFebruary 25, 2022, after the close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly weigh \nthe mitigating evidence; whether the Judge improperly considered a 1997 criminal charge; and \nwhether the Judge improperly found viewing legal pornographic images to be a violation of \nGuideline D. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings of fact are summarized below, in \npertinent part. \nApplicant is 68 years old, married for the third time, with no children of his own.

After the \nchild told her mother (Applicant\u2019s second wife), Applicant admitted his behavior, which occurred \nonce a week for a month. He also admitted viewing images of adolescent girls ages 11 to 15 in \nsexually erotic poses during this time. Arrested on felony charges of sexual assault on a child and \nsexual assault on a child while in a position of trust, Applicant pleaded guilty and was given a \ndeferred sentence, which included four years of unsupervised probation, four years of therapy, and \nregistration as a sex offender. In 2001, Applicant successfully completed all terms of his deferred \nsentence, and the original charges were then dropped. He is no longer listed as a sex offender in \nhis home state. From 2001 to 2016, Applicant voluntarily attended a 12-step recovery program \nfor sex addicts. \nFrom 2001 to 2015, Applicant worked for Employer 1 (E1). In his clearance interview in \nJuly 2019, Applicant admitted that he signed documents acknowledging that E1 prohibited having \nor viewing pornography on company-provided computers. At hearing, Applicant equivocated on \nthis point, stating that he could not recall any specific company policy regarding the personal use \nof a company-issued laptop. Additionally, he testified that someone told him he could use his \ncompany-issued laptop for personal use, but he could not recall who that person was. The Judge \ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. \nIn February 2015, law enforcement became aware that Applicant may have had child \npornography on his company-issued laptop and seized his laptop. Applicant\u2019s employer initially \nput him on administrative leave pending the criminal investigation and subsequently terminated \nhis employment in March 2015. Forensic examiners ultimately concluded that the material found \non the computer was not child pornography, but rather child erotica (adolescent children posed in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nerotic positions with skimpy and/or revealing clothing). The criminal investigation was closed, as \npossession of child erotica was not illegal under state law. \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted using his company-issued laptop to view, upload, \nand save images of naked women and scantily dressed young girls (ages 11-15) posed in erotic \npositions. He also admitted signing company documents prohibiting him from using his company-\nlaptop for these purposes. \nApplicant admitted that he continues to view child erotica on his personal electronic \ndevices, as recently as a month before his security clearance hearing. He continues to view this \nmaterial because he is sexually stimulated by viewing images of scantily dressed girls, ages 11 to \n15, in modeling poses. He admitted that his actions show questionable judgment on his part. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted in pertinent part \nbelow: \nGuideline D \nIn approximately 1997, Applicant pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting his 11-year-old \nstepdaughter on multiple occasions. Between 2001 and 2015, Applicant downloaded and viewed \nimages of adult pornography and child erotica on his company-issued laptop. He admitted that his \nactions demonstrated poor judgment. Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6\u00b6 13(a)1 and 13(d)2 apply. \nThe allegation regarding attendance at a 12-step program does not fall within any disqualifying \ncondition under Guideline D and is found in favor of the Applicant. \nAlthough his sexual assault and his misuse of his work computer to view pornography are \nin the past, Applicant admits to an ongoing sexual interest in viewing child erotica and engaged in \nthis behavior as recently as a month before his hearing. \u201cThe common denominator of a continuing \nsexual fascination with pre-teenage girls and his past criminal acts and unauthorized computer use \nalso involving pre-teenage girls casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 14(b)3 does not apply.\u201d Decision at 6. \nGuideline M \nFrom 2001 and 2015, Applicant viewed, downloaded, and saved adult pornographic \nimages and child erotica using his company-issued laptop in violation of E1\u2019s written prohibition. \n1 AG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted. \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A. \n2 AG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment. Directive, \nEncl. 2, App. A. \n3 AG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment.

His failure to accept responsibility for his \nactions calls into question Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nThe allegation of SOR \u00b6 2.a.\u2014that Applicant signed documents putting him on notice that \npornography was prohibited on his company laptop\u2014does not fall within any of Guideline M\u2019s \ndisqualifying conditions and is found in favor of the Applicant. \nGuideline E \nApplicant\u2019s occasions of committing sexual abuse on his 11-year-old stepdaughter and his \nuse of his company-issued laptop to view pornography and child erotica raise Guideline E security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e)(1)4 and 16(f).5 In light of the similarities between Applicant\u2019s \ncontinuing sexual fixation on pre-teenage girls and his past criminal and employment-ending \nbehavior also involving pre-teenage girls, those security concerns are not mitigated by the passage \nof time. \nDiscussion \nPassage of Time \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to give appropriate weight to his evidence in \nmitigation, particularly \u201cto the time passed since the allegations . . .\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. As \nsummarized above, the Judge specifically considered under each Guideline whether the security \nconcerns were mitigated by the passage of time. He concluded they were not. As the Judge \nhighlights, Applicant admits to a sexual interest in pre-teen girls and child erotica that spans from \nat least 1997 through the present. Moreover, Applicant admits to indulging in that sexual interest \nby viewing child erotica as recently as a month prior to the hearing. The evidence of record amply \nsupports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant demonstrates a continuing course of conduct that \ngives rise to continued security concerns. \n1997 Criminal Charges \nApplicant contends that the Judge improperly considered the 1997 child sexual assault charges. \nHere, he advances two separate arguments. The first is that the charges should be disregarded \nbecause they were \u201cdismissed entirely by the District Attorney.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. However, it is \nwell-established that a DOHA Judge may consider the underlying conduct in evaluating an \n4 AG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or \ngroup. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A. \n5 AG \u00b6 16(f): violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to the employer as a \ncondition of employment.

See e.g., \nISCR Case No. 17-00506 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018). The Directive itself highlights that a \nsecurity concern may arise from \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 13(a). \nSecond, Applicant argues that the 1997 criminal charges should be disregarded because \n\u201c[t]hose facts were known when [Applicant] was previously issued a security clearance and \nnothing has changed since that time except the allegations are now even more distant in time.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 2. Contrary to this assertion, the record confirms that the Government in earlier \nadjudications did not know that Applicant\u2014for 14 years\u2014was accessing pornography and child \nerotica from his work computer in violation of company policy. The Government has the right to \nreconsider the security significance of past conduct in light of more recent conduct having a \nnegative security significance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02399 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 30, 2021). \nPornography and Guideline D \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s determination that an interest in child erotica raises any \nsecurity concerns under Guideline D. He premises his argument on the fact that the 2015 law \nenforcement examination of his computer revealed \u201cno criminal conduct\u201d and that the images he \npossesses are therefore \u201clegal images.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2, 3. Consequently, he argues, the Judge \n\u201cincorrectly found that the use of legal pornographic images constitutes a violation of Guideline \nD.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. Said differently, Applicant argues that sexual behavior raises no security \nconcerns unless it is criminal in nature. This argument is wholly unsupported by the Directive, the \nrecord, and Appeal Board precedent. \nOf Guideline D\u2019s four disqualifying conditions, only AG \u00b6 13(a) references criminal \nbehavior. The Judge determined that Applicant\u2019s behavior in viewing adult pornography and child \nerotica instead raised security concerns under AG \u00b6 13(d), specifically sexual behavior that reflects \nlack of discretion or judgment. We concur. Viewing pornography and child erotica on an \nemployer-issued laptop in the workplace over a period of 14 years inarguably reflects a lack of \njudgment.  Indeed, Applicant admits the same.  Tr. at 36; GE2 at 9. \nApplicant asserts that he \u201cfreely admits his behavior, which eliminates the potential \nvulnerability that such information could otherwise create.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. The record does \nnot support this assertion.  Applicant\u2019s current wife is aware that Applicant sexually assaulted his \nformer stepdaughter and is aware of \u201chis viewing of images of women.\u201d GE2 at 11. However, \nher son and his family live with Applicant and those individuals are \u201cnot aware of his past criminal \ncharge or his issues as a sex addict.\u201d Id. Moreover, Applicant has not told his current employer \nthat he was criminally charged in 1997 for sexual assault of a child or that he was terminated in \n2015 for viewing pornography and child erotica on his work computer. Tr. at 39. Applicant\u2019s \nargument that his past and ongoing sexual behavior, both criminal and non-criminal, does not make \nhim vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress is not persuasive. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant cites to his \u201cconfusion\u201d regarding personal use of his work \ncomputer at E1. He attributes that confusion to a conversation with an unidentified \u201csuperior\u201d and \na \u201cmiscommunication regarding the use of legal images.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2, 3.

Consistent with the \nfollowing, we remand the Judge\u2019s decision. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his Federal \nand state income tax returns for 1995\u20132006 and 2008\u20132018. Under Guideline E, it cross-alleged \nthe Guideline F allegations and also alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his tax \nfiling deficiencies on his 2018 security clearance application (SCA). In responding to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted the allegations with clarifications. Applicant is in his fifties, has never been \nmarried, and has no children. He served in the military from 1984 to 1997 and worked for a \ndefense contractor since 1998. The Judge concluded that Applicant erroneously believed he was \nnot required to file a return for the years in question because his withholdings from his salary were \nmore than sufficient to pay the tax that he owed and he was due refunds for each year. Although \nhe intended to file returns in order to receive refunds, Applicant did not do so and forfeited almost \n$18,000 in Federal refunds and an estimated $10,000 in state refunds. Regarding the falsification \nallegation, the Judge concluded Applicant \u201ccredibly denied intentionally providing false \ninformation,\u201d as he did not realize that he was required to file tax returns if he was due refunds. \nDecision at 3. \nWe concur with the Judge that a key issue in this case is whether or not Applicant knew he \nwas required to file the alleged Federal and state income tax returns. In her appeal brief, \nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues the Judge did not address important aspects of the case \nregarding this issue. We note the following evidence drawn from the record: \n1. While serving in the military, Applicant served as a tax assistant for members of his \nunit. Tr. at 21. During cross-examination, Applicant agreed with Department Counsel\u2019s \ncharacterization of his circumstances regarding tax filing. \nQ: So, you helped other people file their taxes but you didn\u2019t take the time \nto file your own? \nA: That\u2019s a correct statement.

When asked \nabout his filings of 2018 tax returns following his clearance interview, he replied, \n\u201cI, once again, was intending to . . . do it by hand and the due date slipped because \nI wasn\u2019t using a tax service.\u201d Id. at 32. \n3.

GE 2 at 13 and 15. See \nalso Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C. \n6. Department Counsel also notes the Judge described Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nhis tax returns as \u201cfoolish\u201d and as exhibiting \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7, \nquoting from Decision at 2 and 5. In his Guideline E analysis, the Judge did not \nexplain why Applicant\u2019s late filings, which may have been prompted, in part, by \nthe chance of losing a clearance, were sufficient to mitigate the noted poor \njudgment security concerns. \nThe Directive requires a Judge to consider the entire record in evaluating the extent to \nwhich an applicant has met his or her burden of persuasion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03019 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017). In analyzing a challenged conclusion or finding, the Appeal Board \nmust consider not only whether there is evidence supporting it, but also whether there is evidence \nthat fairly detracts from it. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03112 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2002). \nIn this case, the Judge should have addressed the above identified matters in determining \nwhether Applicant knew of his obligation to file the alleged tax returns and whether Applicant \nmitigated the foolishness and poor judgment he demonstrated in failing to file those returns as \nrequired. Given these circumstances, we conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand \nthe case to the Judge to address the identified matters in his Guideline F and E analysis. Upon \nremand, a Judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no \njurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may \nbe appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130. Other issues in the case are not ripe for \nconsideration at this time. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nOrder \nThe Decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

Moody \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSeparate Opinion of Board Member Moira Modzelewski \nI respectfully dissent. I disagree with my colleagues that remand is warranted and would \ninstead affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThere is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nand demonstrating factual or legal error by the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01689 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2020). The application of the adjudicative guidelines is not reducible to a simple \nformula, but rather requires the exercise of sound judgment within the parameters set by the \ndirective. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-27371 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 19, 2003). \nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious because \nit fails to consider an important aspect of the case and runs contrary to the weight of the evidence. \nAt its core, Department Counsel\u2019s argument is this\u2014the Judge erred in his credibility \ndetermination that Applicant honestly believed he did not have to file income tax returns if he \nwould receive a refund. Applicant\u2019s story was implausible in several regards, Department \nCounsel argues, and the Judge failed to consider its implausibility. It is this argument that my \ncolleagues find persuasive, and they require further explanation from the Judge upon remand: \nWe concur with the Judge that a key issue in this case is whether or not \nApplicant knew he was required to file the alleged Federal and state income tax \nreturns. . . . Department Counsel persuasively argues the Judge did not address \nimportant aspects of the case regarding this issue.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 2 \n(June 4, 2001). On appeal, we review a Judge\u2019s challenged findings of fact to determine whether \nthey are supported by substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same \nrecord.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and \nthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an \nadministrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \nThe Judge found that Applicant honestly believed that he did not have to file tax returns as \nhe overpaid taxes each year through withholding and was always due a refund. In evaluating the \nJudge\u2019s factual findings, the Board is required to give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nAppeal Board precedent on this issue is both long\u00ad\nstanding and clear\u2014the party challenging a Judge\u2019s credibility determination has a heavy burden \non appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). \nThe Board\u2019s deference to an Administrative Judge's credibility determination is, of course, \nnot absolute. For instance, a credibility determination may be set aside or reversed if it is \nunreasonable, contradicts other findings, is based on an inadequate reason, is patently without basis \nin the record, or is inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed fact. See ISCR Case No. \n97-0184 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 8. 1998) (internal citations omitted). \u201cWhen a witness\u2019s story is \ncontradicted by other evidence or is so internally inconsistent or implausible that a reasonable fact \nfinder would not credit it, we can find error despite the deference owed a Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination.\u201d ISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr 26, 2012), citing Anderson v. \nBessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 at 575 (1985). When the record contains a basis to question an \napplicant\u2019s credibility (e.g., prior inconsistent statements, prior admissions, or contrary record \nevidence), the Judge should address that aspect of the record explicitly, explaining why he finds \nan applicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of belief. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016). \nThe majority identifies six facts in the record that \u201cthe Judge should have addressed . . . in \ndetermining whether Applicant knew of his obligation to file the alleged tax returns\u201d and \nspecifically requires the Judge upon remand to address these matters. Majority Opinion at 4. \nThe matters identified by the majority opinion are not inconsistent statements, prior admissions, \nor contradictory evidence. In one example, the majority requires the Judge to explain how he \nweighed the fact that\u2014while on active duty in 1996\u2014Applicant was tasked with helping members \nof his combat unit file their 1995 tax returns. The fact that the Judge neglected to include this \nstray piece of information in his decision does not rebut the presumption that he considered all the \nevidence and does not undermine his credibility determination. In another example, the majority \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequires the Judge to address Applicant\u2019s testimony that he intended to file his 2018 return, but \nfailed to do so. \nHowever, that testimony\u2014quoted above in the majority opinion\u2014is not \noverlooked by the Judge or inconsistent with the Judge\u2019s findings. Instead, it is consistent with \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \u201cplanned to file the returns and \nreceive the refunds, but he just never got around to it.\u201d Decision at 2. Said differently, I see no \nsignificant evidence in the record that undercuts the Judge\u2019s credibility determination and permits \nus to challenge that determination, rather than to defer to it. \nBased upon my review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings are supported by \nsubstantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nIn my view, Department Counsel in this case has failed to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all the evidence in the case and failed to carry the heavy burden required for the Board \nto challenge the Judge\u2019s credibility determination. Cf. ISCR Case No. 10-03886 (App. Bd. Apr. \n26, 2012) (in which the Judge chose to believe Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding alleged time card \nfraud rather than the employer\u2019s findings) and ISCR Case No. 19-02304 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2022) \n(in which the Judge accepted Applicant\u2019s in-hearing denials regarding receipt of child pornography \nand disregarded Applicant\u2019s prior admissions). \nAccordingly, I dissent from the Majority Opinion that remand is necessary or appropriate \nin this case. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n7 \n",

On \nAugust 18, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On June 9, 2022, after the hearing, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that he \nhad deliberately omitted material information from his security clearance application (SCA) and \nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

He is single and has no children. Applicant has worked for \nFederal contractors from 2000 to 2004 and from 2008 until the present. He received a secret \nclearance in 2015. He believed that he held a public trust position from 2000 until 2004.  \nIn 1999, while a high school student, Applicant was stopped by the police, who searched \nhis car. The police discovered drug use paraphernalia, which Applicant claimed belonged to a \nfriend. Applicant was arrested, though the charges were dropped after he performed community \nservice. Applicant began using marijuana in 1999 and continued doing so with varying frequency \nuntil October 2016. He used marijuana from 2002 to 2008 on an average of once a month. His \nuse increased in 2012 during a period of stress occasioned by his mother\u2019s illness. Applicant\u2019s \nfinal use of marijuana, in October 2016, occurred after he had been granted a security clearance. \nApplicant completed a SCA in 2011, in which he failed to disclose the full extent of his \ndrug involvement up to that time. The Judge stated that she would consider this non-alleged \nmisconduct only in performing a credibility determination, in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case for \nmitigation, and in performing a whole-person analysis.  \nApplicant completed another SCA in 2016 in which he failed to disclose the 1999 drug \nparaphernalia incident. In this same SCA he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question regarding drug use \nduring the previous seven years. Applicant claimed that his failure to admit the 1999 charge was \ndue to oversight. Regarding drug use, he admitted that his denial was not correct, claiming that he \nwas \u201cnervous\u201d about the matter and that he believed \u201cif he disclosed his drug use in his SCA that \nit would not portray him in a way that best represented him.\u201d Decision at 3. He stated that he \nintended to discuss his drug involvement during his subsequent clearance interview and that he \nhad, in fact, done so, although the record contains no corroborative evidence. He denied that his \nomission of drug use was intentional, though he could not justify his act. The Judge noted that the \nlast page of the SCA allowed for additional comments. Although Applicant did make comments \nabout other questions, he said nothing about wanting to explain his drug use to an investigator. \nThe Judge found Applicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing the 1999 arrest on his 2016 \nSCA to be plausible. However, she found Applicant\u2019s explanations for his failure to disclose his \ndrug use to be lacking in credibility. She also found that Applicant\u2019s employment in drug-free \nworkplaces should have placed him on notice that drug use is incompatible with Federal \nemployment. Applicant provided a statement of intent to refrain from such conduct in the future, \nindicated he no longer lives close to persons with whom he had used drugs, and has shown he \npassed two drug tests. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe Judge resolved three of the four Guideline H allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nHowever, she entered adverse findings on a single allegation that he had used marijuana while \nholding a clearance. She cited to evidence that Applicant was on notice that drug use was \ninconsistent with having access to classified information and that he had failed to abstain even \nafter completing his most recent SCA.

She observed that answering \nlawful questions of security significance honestly is a requirement for those holding access to \nnational secrets and concluded that none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions merited full \napplicability. \nDiscussion \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred by finding that he had deliberately falsified his 2016 \nSCA. However, the record supports the Judge\u2019s findings on this matter. In addition, we give \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u204b E3.1.32.1. The challenged findings \nare \u201csupported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support \na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Id. \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to consider, or that she mis-weighed, pertinent \nevidence, such as his statement of intent to refrain from future drug use, his explanation for his \nfalse statement in his SCA, his expressions of remorse, and his having remained drug free since \n2016. However, the Judge made findings about all this evidence, and her analysis explicitly \naddresses much of it. We note in particular that the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding \nthree of the Guideline H allegations due in large measure to the length of time that has elapsed \nsince his last offense. Moreover, her explanation for reaching the opposite conclusion regarding \nmarijuana use while holding a clearance is supportable. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019) (An applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs after having completed a security \nclearance application or after otherwise having been placed on notice of the incompatibility of \ndrug abuse and clearance eligibility raises questions about his or her judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations). \nApplicant has not rebutted the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). An ability to argue for an alternative \ninterpretation of the evidence is not enough to undermine a Judge\u2019s analysis. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). Applicant cited some Hearing Office cases in support \nof his appeal. We give due consideration to these cases. However, each case must be decided \nupon its own merits. Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). Moreover, Hearing Office decisions are \nbinding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Appeal Board. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02074 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2019). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider, \nand/or mis-weighed, significant record evidence, resulting in a decision that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.

A \nmilitary retiree, he has attended college but does not have a degree. Twice divorced, he has two \nmarried children who do not live with him.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists six delinquent debts, i.e., a deficiency judgment following the \nforeclosure sale of a house, credit card debts, utility bills, and a collection account. The Judge \nfound against Applicant for the three credit card debts of a total amount of about $17,000 and \nentered favorable findings regarding the others. Applicant attributed his financial problems to \nvarious circumstances, such as unemployment, a tenant\u2019s failure to pay rent, support for relatives, \na cohabitant\u2019s medical problems, and two divorces, one of which entailed child support \nobligations. Applicant has approximately $20,000 in bank accounts, enough to pay his credit cards \noff. However, he explained that if he did so, yet lost his clearance anyway, he would be in worse \nfinancial shape than he already is. He stated that this was the basis of his decision \u201cto retain the \nfunds [he] had accumulated to avoid the . . . possibility that [he] would be unable to financially \nsupport [himself] after possible termination of [his] employment[.]\u201d Decision at 5; Applicant \nExhibit V at 14, but the Judge incorrectly cited as 13. \nApplicant has received no formal financial counseling, though he has received ad hoc \nadvice over the years. Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation for honesty, trustworthiness, and \nprofessionalism. During his military career, he deployed 11 times and received numerous \ndecorations. Applicant cited to his difficulties with anxiety and depression, which he believes \nresulted from his military experience. \nThe Judge noted the several things beyond Applicant\u2019s control that affected his financial \ncondition. However, he concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action with \nregard to his credit card debts. He stated that Applicant failed to show that he had maintained \ncontact with the creditors or that he had offered to pay or settle these debts, despite a stable income \nand the apparent ability to resolve them. The Judge noted favorable evidence that Applicant \nprovided, such as his military service and his laudatory character references. However, he \nultimately concluded that Applicant had failed to present a persuasive explanation for his failure \nto have resolved the debts found against him.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s brief includes matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider. \nDirective \u204b E3.1.29. \nHe states that, while he believes that the Judge \u201capplied his best \nunderstanding\u201d of the mitigating conditions, he failed properly to understand Applicant\u2019s position \nand arguments. Appeal Brief at 1. He cites to a significant amount of evidence that he believes \nthe Judge did not consider or that he failed properly to weigh, such as (1) the circumstances \nsurrounding his effort to resolve the mortgage debt that was found in his favor; (2) the length of \ntime involved in the processing of his application for a clearance; (3) his reasons for not paying \noff the credit card debts; (4) the various circumstances underlying his financial problems; and (5) \nfavorable evidence such as his work history and professional attainments. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn the first point, he argues that he delayed paying off his other debts in order to have \nenough money to satisfy the substantial deficiency judgment alleged in the SOR, although the VA \nultimately absolved him of that obligation. See AE S, Letter from Veterans Administration. We \nfind no reason to believe that the Judge failed to consider or that he mis-weighed this evidence, \nespecially insofar as he resolved the mortgage deficiency in Applicant\u2019s favor. That he did not \ndraw from this evidence the implication that Applicant urges in his brief does not undermine the \nJudge\u2019s decision. Concerning the length of time it has taken to process Applicant\u2019s case, we have \nno jurisdiction to rule on the manner in which officials conduct clearance investigations. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 17-04070 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 18, 2019). In any event, Applicant has not shown \nthat the time involved in adjudicating his clearance application impaired his ability to present his \ncase for mitigation. Regarding his ultimate reasons for not paying off his credit cards, the Judge \nmade extensive findings drawn from Applicant\u2019s evidence, and he addressed these findings in his \nanalysis.  After considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s arguments, we conclude that Applicant has \nnot rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or that he \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nApplicant presents arguments regarding SOR allegations about utility bills and internet \nservices. The Judge resolved these allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor; accordingly, there is no reason \nfor us to address these arguments. Applicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. For \nexample, he notes that the Judge found that he had held a clearance for at least 7 years.  In reality, \nApplicant presented evidence that he has held a clearance for around 25 years, which includes his \nactive duty military career. See AE J at 17. The challenged finding is therefore erroneous, \nalthough, even if he had found as Applicant argues, the Judge would probably have rendered the \nsame ultimate decision in this case. Therefore, this error is harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). After reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s \nmaterial findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or \ninferences that could be drawn from the record. Applicant has not identified any harmful error \nlikely to change the outcome of the case. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s \nmaterial findings of security concern are sustainable. Id. Applicant states that other persons \nsimilarly situated had \u201cbeen placed under a monitored state as a stipulation of their clearance being \nupheld\u201d and requests such a procedure for himself. Appeal Brief at 5. Applicant\u2019s arguments and \nthe record evidence do not support application of any of the possible waivers to policy set forth in \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. C.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01084 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2020).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

She has not submitted any supporting documents for tax years 2011 and 2012. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below, in pertinent part: \nApplicant went through an extremely difficult period, and those events were \nbeyond her control. The real question is whether she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \n.  .  . \n[Applicant] asserted that her tax liability for 2010 is greatly exaggerated because \nshe received an inaccurate IRS Form 1099, and that her actual income was about \n$220,000. She would receive more credit for that statement if she had paid any of \nthe taxes from 2010.  From 2010 to the present, Applicant has paid nothing for her \n2010 federal income taxes. . . . She currently owes the IRS more than $230,000 for \ntax years 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2019. Her liability for her state income taxes and \nher federal income taxes for years 2011 and 2012 is unknown. Applicant has not \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) [the conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances] is not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(g) \n[the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or \npay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements] is applicable \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto the filed income tax returns. It is not applicable to the returns that have not been \nfiled and the federal income taxes that have not been paid.  [Decision at 5\u20136.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s material findings. She does, \nhowever, challenge his conclusion that she has not mitigated the security concerns, asserting that \n\u201cI mitigated my Tax situation by hiring a Tax Attorney as soon as possible . . . .\u201d Appeal Brief at \n1. However, the fact that an Applicant retains an attorney and files delinquent tax returns does not \ncompel a Judge to issue a favorable decision. The Judge must examine the record evidence and \ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. The \ntiming of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to consider in the application of \nboth AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(g). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2018). Moreover, Applicant failed to produce any evidence that she has made arrangements with \nthe IRS to begin payments on her sizeable federal tax debt, much less that she has begun payment \non that debt. Her argument that she has mitigated her tax delinquencies by hiring a tax attorney is \nnot persuasive.   \nAdditionally, Applicant reiterates the personal and family difficulties that have beset her \nover the past ten years\u2014evidence that was before the Judge and included in his decision. To the \nextent that Applicant is arguing that the Judge misweighed that evidence, her arguments are not \nsufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances beyond her control, \nthe Judge may still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those difficulties.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 23, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On about March \n6, 2020, Applicant answered the SOR (SOR Answer), attached documents, and requested a \ndecision on the written record. On July 9, 2020, Applicant received his copy of the Government\u2019s \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), but subsequently failed to submit any matters in response. On \nFebruary 4, 2021, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nclearance. Applicant timely appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30 and provided \ndocuments relating to two alleged student loan debts. \nBy decision of May 10, 2021, the Appeal Board determined that the record raised due \nprocess concerns and remanded the decision for assignment to a different Judge to reopen the \nrecord and to afford Applicant an additional opportunity to submit matters in response to the \nFORM. \nOn August 5, 2021, following communications and proceedings detailed below, \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdministrative Judge Braden M. Murphy issued a Decision on Remand in which he denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant again appealed. Applicant\u2019s appeal brief \nmakes no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge, but instead provides an updated status \non the alleged debts. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nProceedings Upon Remand \nFollowing remand of the decision, the Administrative Judge held a conference call on May \n19, 2021, with Applicant and Department Counsel. The Judge subsequently summarized the \nconference call in an email, Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1, which Applicant received. During the \nconference call, Applicant confirmed that he received the FORM, that he did not submit a response, \nand that he desired to do so. In compliance with the remand order, the Judge then reopened the \nrecord until June 18, 2021, to give Applicant the opportunity to submit documents in response to \nthe FORM, to include \u201cdocuments relating to specific SOR debts, relating to his finances generally, \nor any other matters he wishes to provide.\u201d HE 1 at 2. The Judge also requested that Applicant \nreview the Government\u2019s documents included in the FORM and note any objections, calling his \nattention to the summary of subject interview, his security clearance application, and the credit \nreports. \nApplicant failed to submit any response by the deadline of June 18, 2021. On July 8, 2021, \nthe Judge emailed Applicant to verify whether he had submitted any documents to DOHA since \nthe conference call of May 19, 2021.  Applicant\u2019s email response of July 12, 2021, was unclear: \nHello. I have no additional documents to submit at this time. The only form that \nI\u2019ve tried to submit were to be via fax. The only form is to be submitted is the form \nrequest by the administrative judge was the FORM document that contains all \nmaterial required. I was unsuccessful in reaching everyone on the form; however, \ndid get in contact with 2 in material presented but no documents was received to \ndetails any and additional information for FORM. [Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 1 at 1.] \nBy email sent the same day, the Judge requested that Applicant respond by July 14, 2021, to clarify \nwhether he had submitted any documents for consideration, but Applicant failed to respond.  \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is 40 years old and a 2009 college graduate. A long-term employee of a campus \nbookstore, he became unemployed in early 2017, when the store closed, but secured employment \nagain a few months later. His recent employment history is unclear from the record. He has not \npreviously held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent student loans that total about $54,000 and four consumer \ncredit accounts that total about $5,440. All debts are established by either Applicant\u2019s admissions \nor by the credit reports of record. In his March 2020 SOR Answer, Applicant asserted that he was \nin a rehabilitation program for one student loan and had recently authorized a payment of $53, but \nhas submitted no documentation of the plan or proof of any payments made under it since March \n2020. Regarding the second student loan, Applicant asserted that it had been placed in forbearance, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith a graduated payment plan that was to begin in March 2020 and continue through 2034, but \nhe has submitted no documentation that any monthly payments were made on the account since \nMarch 2020. Although payments of Applicant\u2019s federal student loans were likely suspended until \nat least September 2021 due to President Biden\u2019s extension of the temporary student loan relief, \nApplicant\u2019s accounts were delinquent for years, there is no evidence of any payments on either \nloan since March 2020, and there is nothing in the evidence of record to establish their current \nstatus.  \nFor a charged-off credit card debt, Applicant stated in his SOR Answer that he had a \npayment plan, but submitted no proof of payments under the plan. For a cellphone account and a \nbank debt, applicant admitted the debts, but stated that he could not afford to pay them. Regarding \nan auto loan debt, Applicant asserted in his SOR Answer that the debt had been paid, relying upon \ndocuments submitted to the background investigator. The Judge found for Applicant on the auto \nloan debt, but against him on the other five debts alleged, concluding that Applicant provided \ninsufficient information or documentation to establish any of the relevant mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion \nOn this second appeal, Applicant again makes no assertion of error on the Judge\u2019s part, but \ninstead provides an update on five of the alleged accounts, including his attempts to contact \ncreditors. These are new matters not contained in the record, which we cannot consider. See \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29 (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d). \nAlthough our review of the earlier decision revealed due process concerns, our review of \nthe record following remand confirms that Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set \nforth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive. Upon remand, the Judge confirmed that \nApplicant had copies of all evidence that the government intended to offer and had an opportunity \nto object to it. The Judge advised Applicant that he could provide documents relating to specific \ndebts, his general financial situation, or any other matter that he wished to submit. Upon hearing \nnothing from Applicant by the 30-day deadline, the Judge reached out to Applicant to verify \nwhether he had submitted documents or intended to do so. Upon receiving an ambiguous and \nconfusing response, the Judge afforded Applicant an opportunity to clarify, but Applicant failed to \ndo so.  \nThe record indicates that the Administrative Judge conducted the case upon remand in an \nimpartial, professional manner and in compliance with our order. Although pro se applicants \ncannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect \ntheir rights under the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001). \nIf they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, their failure to act does not \nconstitute denial of their rights. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003). \nA review of the entire record discloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the \nrights due him under the Directive or that he was not adequately advised of those rights. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-04472 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2017). It is an applicant\u2019s job to present evidence \nsufficient to mitigate the concerns raised in his case, and the applicant bears the ultimate burden \nof persuasion that he should be granted a clearance.

We cannot receive new evidence and do \nnot review cases de novo. Our authority to review is limited to cases in which the appealing party \nhas raised a claim of harmful error.
