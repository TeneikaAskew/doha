Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nSecond Remand Decision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on May 3, \n2007. On November 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence; Guideline C, Foreign Preference; and Guideline M, Use of \nInformation Technology. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 3, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJanuary 14, 2009. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2009. On February 6, \n2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for February 24, 2009. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits \n(Gov) 1 - 5, which were admitted without objection. The Government requested that \nadministrative notice be taken of one document with 15 attachments. The document \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwas marked as Hearing Exhibit I (Hearing Ex I) without objection. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted five exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 E without \nobjection. Applicant presented a typed copy of his opening and closing statements. \n(Hearing Exhibit II) Applicant testified and called five witnesses on his behalf. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr) of the hearing on March 4, 2009. The record was held open \nuntil March 10, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  No additional \ndocuments were submitted. \n \n \nI issued a decision on March 24, 2009. I found that Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline M, Use of \nInformation Technology. I found he did not mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference, and I concluded it was not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \n \n \nOn April 1, 2009, Applicant appealed my decision, providing evidence that was \nnot provided before the close of the record.  Department Counsel filed a response to \nApplicant\u2019s appeal stating that under the facts of the case an expedited remand would \nbe the equitable resolution to put the pertinent evidence before the Administrative \nJudge. On April 16, 2009, the Appeal Board remanded the case for further processing \nbased on the additional evidence submitted by Applicant in his appeal. The additional \nevidence provided was a two-page document which I marked as AE D based on the \nAppeal Board\u2019s direction to consider the document as additional evidence even though \nthe record had closed. (Upon further review of the case file during this second remand, \nit should actually be marked as AE F. I remarked the post-decision exhibit as AE F.) \nAfter considering the additional document, I issued a remand decision on May 6, 2009, \nconcluding that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information.  \n \n \nOn June 29, 2009, the Appeal Board remanded the case to me because \nApplicant had offered a total of four pages in conjunction with his first appeal. The file \nonly contained two pages. I considered the additional two pages as directed by the \nAppeal Board and marked them as AE G.  I conclude based on a review of the case file, \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits, including AE F and AE G as directed by the Appeal \nBoard, that eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe security concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems are not addressed in this remand \ndecision because the concerns were mitigated in my previous decision, dated March 24, \n2009.  \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior mechanical engineer employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer from 1985 to \n1992, and from 1996 to present. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical \n\n \n3 \n \n \nengineering. He is married and has four daughters, ages 29, 27 and 12 year-old twins. \nHe has held a SECRET clearance since 1985. (Tr at 7, 74-77; Gov 1)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Israel. He moved to the United States in \nFebruary 1976. He completed his college education at a U.S. university. He attended \nthe first two years of college in Israel. He met his wife on a previous trip to the United \nStates. After a long distance courtship, they became engaged and he moved to the \nUnited States on a fianc\u00e9 visa. Applicant became a United States citizen on June 27, \n1980. (Tr at 48-49; Gov 1; Gov 2)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife moved with her family to the United States when she was four \nyears old. She became a U.S. citizen in 1968 and has continuously lived in the U.S. She \nhas no relatives living in Israel. All of their daughters were born and live in the U.S. (Tr \nat 74-77) His wife is a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S. by virtue of her birth in Israel. \nHis children are considered dual citizens of Israel and the U.S. by virtue of their parents\u2019 \nIsraeli citizenship.  Prior to traveling to Israel to visit family in June 2007, the entire \nfamily applied for Israeli passports. The Israeli Consulate did not issue his wife a \npassport. Applicant is not sure why but thinks it was because she lived in the U.S. for \nsuch a lengthy period of time and never applied for an Israeli passport. Applicant and \nhis children were each issued Israeli passports. They used the passports only to travel \nto Israel.  His wife traveled to Israel on her U.S. passport and had to go through the line \nfor non-Israeli citizens when entering Israel. (Tr at 17, 45-46, 56)     \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel.  He possesses a valid Israeli \npassport. It was issued on March 12, 2007, and does not expire until March 11, 2017. \nHe held a previous Israeli passport which was issued on June 19, 1996, and expired on \nJune 18, 2001.  He renewed his Israeli passport because he believes it was the only \nway he could travel to Israel. (Tr at 52-53, 72) Applicant has a valid U.S. passport. \nUnder cross-examination, Applicant admitted that he could travel as a non-Israeli citizen \nto Israel. He would have to wait in the non-Israeli citizen line while arriving in the \ncountry. (Tr at 64) \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant and his family traveled to Israel on a two-week \nsightseeing tour. In October 2000, he traveled to Israel alone to visit family, staying for \napproximately 10 days. In the past, Applicant\u2019s employer sent him to Israel on business \ntrips. His employer had a partnership with an Israeli defense company to develop a \nmissile for the U.S. Air Force. Applicant traveled to Israel on company business from \nJune 1996 to December 1996, from October 2001 to December 2001, and for one week \nin July 2003. (Tr at 44-47, 89; Gov 3) \n \nNeither Applicant nor his wife and children receive benefits from Israel. He has \nno investments in Israel. He owns a home in the U.S. and all of his investments are \nlocated in the U.S. (Tr at 20, 72-73, 89; Gov 3; Gov 4) \n \nOn November 14, 2007, Applicant was interviewed in conjunction with his \nbackground investigation.  During the interview the subject of Applicant\u2019s possession of \n\n \n4 \n \n \na valid Israeli passport was discussed. During the interview, Applicant stated that he will \nrelinquish his Israeli passport to his employer but would like to have it returned when he \nwants to travel to Israel in the future. (Gov 3 at 7) \n \nOn April 29, 2008, he affirmed this statement in response to interrogatories sent \nto him by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. He states:  \n \nI have indicated that I have no issues of surrounding my passport to the \ncompany security office for storage until my need to go to Israel for a visit \nagain. If I am correct, I asked the security manager at Lockheed Martin if \nthey can hold/keep my passport, and getting it back to me upon request \nbefore going back to visit in Israel, but he said that they do not have the \nmechanism or the system to do so. (Gov 3 at 11) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant stated that he is willing to renounce his Israeli citizenship \nand surrender his Israeli passport. Prior to the hearing, he inquired about the process at \nthe Israeli consulate. They informed him that it would take approximately one year.  \nApplicant believes that he cannot surrender his Israeli passport to the Israeli Consulate \nuntil after the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship is complete. Applicant did not begin \nproceedings to renounce his Israeli citizenship and/or surrender his Israeli passport \nprior to the hearing. He was willing to surrender his Israeli passport to the company \nFacility Security Officer (FSO) pending the process of the renouncing his Israeli \ncitizenship. (Tr at 18, 21, 58-68) \n \n Applicant is concerned that he may need his Israeli passport to visit his mother \nshould she become ill. If something should happen to his mother, he may ask the FSO \nto have his Israeli passport returned to him in order to travel to Israel to visit his mother. \nHe was advised on several occasions during the hearing that if he does so it will raise a \nsecurity issue and could result in the revocation of his security clearance. (Tr at 61-62, \n64-65, 67, 150)    \n \nApplicant testified that he would surrender his Israeli passport to the FSO within \na week of the hearing. (Tr at 62) He claims the FSO told him that in other cases, \napplicants surrendered their foreign passports to the FSO and the passport was \nphysically destroyed and sent the government a letter confirming the passport was \ndestroyed. Applicant testified, \n \n\u2026..With my case he cannot do it because this is \u2013 this is Israeli property. \n \nSo I told him [the FSO] he cannot destroy it because I\u2019ll be penalized. So I \nhave to go by the United States rules and the Israeli rules as long as I \nhave this. And I am willing to do this.(Tr at 66, lines 16-21) \n \nApplicant was not willing to destroy his Israeli passport because he believed it \nviolated Israeli law. (Tr at 66-67)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUpon listening to Applicant\u2019s testimony that he intended to surrender his passport \nto his FSO pending the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship, Department Counsel \nstated they had no objection to leaving the record open for a period of time to allow \nApplicant to surrender his passport to his facility security officer. (Tr at 64, lines 8-12) I \nheld the record open for two weeks (until March 10, 2009) to allow Applicant to submit \nevidence that he surrendered his Israeli passport to his FSO. (Tr at 64, lines 14-26.) \nApplicant responded: \u201cThat\u2019s enough sufficient time as I said to Mr. Duffy I am willing to \ndo it this week.\u201d (Tr at 64, lines 17-19) \n \nAt the close of the hearing, I told the Applicant: \n \nAdministrative Judge: We will hold the record open until two weeks from \ntoday, related to the passport issue. And for some reason if you would \nneed additional time, if you would contact [Department Counsel] and he \nwill let me know and I can probably give you another week extension.  \n \nApplicant: So you want me to start the process to surrender my passport \nto [my FSO], he\u2019s the security manager at [my company].  \n \nAdministrative Judge: Yes. \n \nApplicant: I will do it. (Tr at 149, lines 8-19) \n \nAdministrative Judge: It\u2019s, like he can prepare an affidavit saying \nthat he has accepted \u2013 \n \nApplicant: You want me to have him write a letter and sent to \n[Department Counsel]? \n \nDepartment Counsel: If he doesn\u2019t have a standard form, he can \ncontact me. We could give him a sample of what it would look like. \n \nApplicant: Sure. Yes. And as I said, I am willing to postpone my trip to \nIsrael this year and wait for your decision and obviously wait and postpone \nmy trip until everything is over because of renouncing my citizenship and \nsurrendering the passport, is completed. \n \nDepartment Counsel: You understand that if you go back and get your \npassport from [the FSO] once you have surrendered it, you have triggered \nagain a security concern. \n \nApplicant: Yes. Yes. \n \nDepartment Counsel: It could end up in the revocation of a clearance if the \njudge decided to grant your clearance today. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant: Yes, I do. Thank you. (Tr at 149, lines 8-25, 150, lines 1-16) \n \nNo additional documents were submitted during the two week period the record \nwas left open.  I contacted Department Counsel at the close of the record to inquire \nwhether Applicant had contacted Department Counsel or submitted anything. Applicant \nhad not contacted Department Counsel.  \n \nApplicant claims in AE F, dated April 1, 2009, that there was a miscommunication \nbetween him and his security department. He claims that in similar cases the court has \nforwarded a letter of instruction at the completion of the case which provides direction to \nthe security office. His security office thought such a letter would be forthcoming with \ninstructions. He claims that he did not understand that the directions provided at the \nhearing were all that would take place. He attached a letter from his FSO which verified \nthat he surrendered his valid Israeli passport to the FSO on April 1, 2009, eight days \nafter the adverse decision was issued. (AE F)  \n \nThe two pages of additional evidence that was not contained in the file during the \nfirst remand consist of an apparent e-mail sent by Applicant to his FSO one day after \nthe hearing. In the e-mail Applicant claims that the administrative judge told him the \nAppeal Verdict will be sent to his home address by March 10, 2009. He states that he \nwill surrender his Israeli passport to the FSO and if the FSO needed further instructions \nof how to do it, the FSO can call Department Counsel. He then asks when he should \nbring his Israeli passport to the FSO.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s FSO apparently sent a reply e-mail that same day. He stated to \nApplicant: \n \nI checked the paperwork for the passport that I am holding and DOHA \nsent a letter covering the handling of the passport and form that they \nwanted filled out and notarized in order for me to hold the passport. The \nletter has specific instructions for handling the passport while in my \npossession. I would expect a similar letter to come with a form attached \nfor your passport, is that what you believe will happen? (AE G) \n \nApplicant indicated on page 2 of AE G that his verbal reply to the FSO was that \nhe agreed with the FSO and he will wait for further instructions from DOHA even though \nthis was contrary to what was discussed at hearing.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline M, Use of \nInformation Technology Systems, will not be addressed because they were not the \nbasis for the remand decision.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC)10(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport); and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or \nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. Applicant \nrenewed his Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen on June 27, 1980. The record \nevidence indicates Applicant renewed his Israeli passport on June 19, 1996. This \npassport expired on June 18, 2001. He also renewed his Israeli passport on March 12, \n2007. The passport does not expire until March 11, 2017.  Applicant was entitled to an \nIsraeli passport by virtue of his status as an Israeli citizen. Applicant traveled to Israel \nusing his Israeli passport in June 2007, and October 2000. He also traveled to Israel \nusing his Israeli passport while on company business from June 1996 to December \n1996, October 2001 to December 2001, and for one week in July 2003. His renewal of \nhis Israeli passport and his use of his Israeli passport to travel to and from Israel is an \nexercise of foreign citizenship.   \n \nApplicant arranged for his children to obtain Israeli passports when they traveled \nto Israel in 2007. They are U.S. citizens who were born in the U.S. and could have used \nU.S. passports. This action also indicates a preference for his home country. While not \nalleged in the SOR under foreign preference, the Appeal Board has determined that \neven though crucial security concerns are not alleged in the SOR, the Judge may \nconsider those security concerns when they are relevant and factually related to a \ndisqualifying condition that was alleged in the SOR. ISCR 05-01820 at 3 n.4 (App. Bd. \nDecember 14, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 8 (App. Bd. March 17, 2003) \nand ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 (App. Bd. February 12, 2003)).  \n \nSince Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and the government produced \nsubstantial evidence by way of exhibits to raise disqualifying conditions FP DC \u00b6 10(a) \nand FP DC \u00b6 10(b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15). An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (DOHA Appeal Board \nDecision, September 22, 2005)). \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Preference. \n \nForeign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is \nbased solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country) does not apply. While \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Israel, he continued to exercise his Israeli citizenship \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen.  He renewed his Israeli passport on several occasions \nand used it to travel to and from Israel. His application for and use of a foreign passport \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen was an exercise of dual citizenship and reveals a \ncontinued preference for his home country. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship) applies. Applicant testified that he intended to renounce his Israeli \ncitizenship. He testified that prior to the hearing, he contacted the Israeli consulate \nabout the steps required to renounce his Israeli citizenship but had not started the \nprocess to renounce his Israeli citizenship.  FP MC \u00b6 11(b) is given less weight because \nwhile Applicant expressed an intention to renounce his Israeli citizenship during the \nhearing, he also expressed a concern that he may need his Israeli passport in the future \nto travel to Israel to visit his mother.  There is no evidence in the record that he took the \nformal steps to renounce his Israeli citizenship.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11 (c) (exercise of rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a \nminor) does not apply. Applicant was an adult when he became a U.S. citizen. After \nbecoming a U.S. citizen, he exercised his Israeli citizenship by renewing his Israeli \npassport and using his Israeli passport as opposed to his U.S. passport when traveling \nto Israel.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11 (d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority) does not apply to the facts of this case. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) does not apply. Applicant did not take steps \nto mitigate the concerns raised by his possession and use of a valid foreign passport \nbefore the hearing. He was first put on notice that his possession of a valid foreign \npassport was a security issue when he was interviewed during his security clearance \nbackground investigation on November 14, 2007. He was put on notice again when the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals sent him interrogatories which he answered on \nApril 29, 2008. On November 14, 2008, he was served the SOR which clearly stated his \npossession of a valid Israeli passport was an issue under the foreign preference \nconcern as stated in Guideline C of the Directive. He was provided a copy of the \nDirective with his SOR. The Directive lists the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline C. He was on notice as to what steps to take to mitigate the concerns \nraised under foreign preference. He took no steps to mitigate this issue prior to his \nhearing which occurred on February 24, 2009.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant expressed his intent to surrender his valid foreign passport to \nhis FSO during the hearing, it was clear he had reservations about surrendering his \nIsraeli passport. He testified that he may need to ask his FSO to return his Israeli \npassport in the future in order to visit his mother. This was not the first time that he \nindicated that he might have to ask for his Israeli passport back if he needs to travel to \n\n \n10 \n \n \nIsrael.  He initially stated that he was willing to surrender his Israeli passport to his FSO \nduring his background investigation interview on November 14, 2007, but would like to \nhave it returned to him when he wants to travel to Israel in the future. He reaffirmed this \nstatement in response to interrogatories on April 29, 2008, stating that he has no issues \nof surrendering his passport to the company security office for storage until his need to \ngo to Israel for a visit again.  \n \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) gives Applicant several options. He could have destroyed the \npassport; he could have surrendered it to the cognizant security authority; or otherwise \ninvalidate it.  Applicant could have destroyed or invalidated the passport prior to \nhearing. He chose not to do so out of concern that he would violate Israeli law. He \ndecided not to surrender the passport to the Israeli consulate. He decided his option \nwould be to surrender the passport to his FSO. However, he did not surrender the \npassport to his FSO within the two weeks that the record was held open after the \nhearing.  He did not contact Department Counsel or the Hearing Office to ask questions \nabout the proper way to surrender his foreign passport to his FSO. Regardless, \nApplicant\u2019s repeated comments that he may have to ask for it back if the need to travel \nto Israel arises in the future leads me to conclude that his surrender is a conditional one. \nA security concern remains under foreign preference.  \n \n \nApplicant was or should have been aware that possession of a valid foreign \npassport was a security issue for more than 14 months prior to the hearing. He did not \ntake action until after the record was closed and an adverse decision was issued. \nApplicant was provided sufficient instructions at the hearing on what needed to be done \nto show proof of surrender of his foreign passport to his FSO. He was advised if he \nneeded additional time, he could submit a request for an extension of time. Although not \nrequired to, Department Counsel advised Applicant to call him if he needed a sample \nmemorandum for his FSO to use to verify the surrender of his foreign passport. \nApplicant was never told to wait for further instructions from the government.  \n \n \nThe burden was always on Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised \npertaining to his possession of a valid foreign passport. Considering the extensive \ninstructions provided to Applicant during the hearing, his assertion that he was awaiting \nfurther instructions from the government after the hearing is not credible.   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s renewal, possession and use of an Israeli foreign passport over a \nnumber of years after becoming a U.S. citizen indicates that he still has a preference for \na foreign country. Although not alleged in the SOR under Guideline C, the fact that he \narranged for his family to obtain Israeli passports prior to traveling to Israel in 2007, \nreinforces a preference for his home country. Although he eventually surrendered his \nvalid foreign passport to his FSO, his equivocations about surrendering his foreign \npassport during the hearing, his numerous statements that he may need to ask for it \nback in the future if he needs to travel to Israel, and his extensive delay in taking action \nto surrender his foreign passport does not mitigate the foreign preference security \nconcern. Security concerns under foreign preference are not mitigated.  \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. as well his relationship with his mother and two brothers who are citizens of and \nreside in Israel. I considered Applicant\u2019s work history and the favorable testimony from \nApplicant\u2019s current and former co-workers.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s explanations in AE F and AE G as to why he did not \nsurrender his Israeli passport prior to the close of the record. The record evidence \ncontradicts his assertions and I do not find his explanation credible.   \n \nApplicant had ample time prior to the hearing to address concerns related to his \npossession of a valid foreign passport. He did not do so but professed at hearing that he \nintended to do so within a week following the hearing. The record was held open for two \nweeks to allow him the opportunity to do so. Applicant had the burden to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline C involving the possession of a valid foreign \npassport. He ignored the instructions provided to him at hearing and did nothing during \nthe two weeks the record was held open.  The burden was on Applicant to mitigate the \nforeign preference concerns not the government or his security office. He took no action \nto ensure that his foreign passport was surrendered before the close of the record.  \n  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held in the past that an Applicant\u2019s argument \nregarding his lack of knowledge is not persuasive: \n \nApplicant\u2019s argument regarding his lack of knowledge is not persuasive. \nOn June 24, 2004, Applicant received the ASDC3I memorandum (Money \nmemo) dated August 16, 2000, which spells out the Department\u2019s policy \n\n \n12 \n \n \non this matter.  Applicant provided a submission to the Administrative \nJudge, dated July 18, 2004. Applicant had an opportunity to review the \nMoney memorandum before he provided his last submission, yet he did \nnot surrender the passport or request additional time to do so. Now that \nthe record is closed and the Judge has issued an adverse decision. \nApplicant requests that the Board grant him one month to surrender the \npassport. The Board is not permitted to consider new evidence on appeal. \nSee, Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29. ISCR Case \n02-23506 at 3 (Appeal Board Decision, February 16, 2005.) see also ISCR \nCase 02-12733 at 3 (Appeal Board Decision, December 19, 2003)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s case is distinguished in that the Money memorandum no longer \napplies. However, Applicant received the SOR on November 14, 2008. He was provided \na copy of the Directive in conjunction with the SOR.  He had the opportunity to review \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions that were raised under the foreign preference \nconcern.  More than three months passed prior to his hearing. He took no action with \nregard to the possession of his foreign passport. At hearing, he expressed an intent to \nsurrender the passport to his FSO, albeit with comments that he may need to ask for it \nback if he needed to travel to Israel. The record was held open two weeks after the \nhearing to give Applicant time to surrender his Israeli passport to his FSO. It was his \nburden and his responsibility to surrender the passport prior to the close of the record. \nHe took no action until after he received the initial adverse decision, dated March 24, \n2009.     \n \nApplicant ultimately surrendered his valid foreign passport to his security office \nbut only after his security clearance was denied. Prior to doing so, Applicant indicated \non several occasions during his background investigation including during the hearing \nthat he may need to ask for it back the next time he travels to Israel. Considering these \nstatements, I cannot conclude that it was an unqualified surrender of his foreign \npassport. Doubts remain under the foreign preference concern. Clearance is denied.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not  \nclearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 14, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems)  of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn March 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief explicitly relied on evidence that was not before the Judge.  Department\nCounsel filed a response to Applicant\u2019s brief stating that under the facts of this case expedited\nremand would be the equitable resolution to put the pertinent evidence before the Judge.\nAccordingly, the case was remanded to the Judge for further processing.  The Judge issued a Remand\nDecision on May 6, 2009.  Applicant again appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe Appeal Board again remanded the case to the Judge for consideration of additional evidence.\n\n2\nOn July 29, 2009, the Judge issued a Second Remand Decision.  Applicant again appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issue: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm\nthe Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:  Applicant was born and raised in\nIsrael, where he completed the first two years of college.  Applicant emigrated to the United States\non a fianc\u00e9 visa and became a United States citizen 1980.  Applicant\u2019s mother and two brothers are\ncitizens of and residents  in Israel.   Applicant\u2019s wife was born in Israel, but emigrated to the United\nStates with her family when she was a small child.  Applicant\u2019s wife became a United States citizen\nin 1968 and has no relatives in Israel.  Applicant and his wife have four daughters, all of whom were\nborn in the United States.\nApplicant, his wife, and his daughters are all dual citizens of Israel and the United States.\nIn 2007, Applicant and his wife and daughters traveled to Israel.  All of them applied for Israeli\npassports.  The Israeli government issued passports to Applicant and his daughters, but did not issue\none to his wife.  Applicant is not sure why, but assumes it is because his wife had lived in the United\nStates for such a long time and had never applied for an Israeli passport before.  Applicant\u2019s wife\nwas able to enter Israel using her American passport, but had to wait in the non-Israeli citizen line\nin customs.  \nApplicant has strong ties to the United States and has no financial interests in Israel.  At the\nhearing, Applicant stated that he is willing to renounce his Israeli citizenship and surrender his Israeli\npassport.  Applicant has been told that the renunciation process will take approximately one year.\nApplicant believes he cannot surrender his passport to the Israeli Consulate until the renunciation\nprocess is complete.  Applicant is concerned that he may need his Israeli passport to visit his mother\nif she should become ill.  Applicant stated that he is willing to surrender his passport to the Facility\nSecurity Officer (FSO) of his employer, as long as the FSO agrees to retain the passport until\nApplicant has completed the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship.  \nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to Guidelines B and M.  Only the Judge\u2019s findings\nand conclusions as to Guideline C are at issue.  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

He did not do so but professed at hearing that he intended to do so within a week following the hearing.  The\nrecord was held open for two weeks to allow him the opportunity to do so.  Applicant had the burden to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline C involving the possession of a valid foreign passport.  He ignored the\ninstructions provided to him at hearing and did nothing during the two weeks the record was held open.  The burden was\non Applicant to mitigate the foreign preference concerns not the government or his security office.  He took no action\nto ensure that his foreign passport was surrendered before the close of record.\u201d  Second Remand Decision at 11.  \n3\nIn his appeal of the Judge\u2019s original decision, Applicant points to three factual errors.  One\nis his job title.  That is a harmless error.  The second is the distance he traveled between job sites\nduring a particular period.  That is harmless error, particularly since the Judge ruled in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor as to the incident involved.  The third pertains to the Judge\u2019s characterization of the rules under\nwhich Applicant would travel to Israel if he no longer had an Israeli passport.  Applicant clarifies\nthe Judge\u2019s statement in this regard.  To the extent that the Judge\u2019s characterization is not clear, it\nis in error.  As explained below, the error is not harmful, since the clarification would be unlikely\nto change the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01105 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 15,\n2008). \nIn finding against Applicant under Guideline C, the Judge discussed Foreign Preference\nDisqualifying Condition (FCDC) 10(a),  noting that Applicant renewed his Israeli passport on at least\n1\ntwo occasions after becoming an American citizen.  Decision at 8.  The Judge then discussed the\nrelevant Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FCMC) 11(b)  and (e).   She explained that the\n2\n3\nrecord was held open for two weeks for Applicant to document that he had followed through on his\nstated intentions to begin the process of renouncing his Israeli passport and to surrender his passport\nto his FSO.  The Judge stated that at the close of the record Applicant still possessed a foreign\npassport.   The Judge\u2019s statement is sustainable.\n4\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national\nsecurity to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.\nSecond Remand Decision at 13.

Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDISSENTING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE MICHAEL Y. RA\u2019ANAN\nApplicant raises errors in the Judge\u2019s third decision which, at least cumulatively, are harmful:\nThe Judge\u2019s decision says: \u201cHe renewed his Israeli passport because he believes it was the\nonly way he could travel to Israel.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Actually, as Applicant  notes it is not merely his\nbelief, but it is Israeli law.  This  is confirmed by Government Administrative Notice Item II which\nsays: \u201cIsraeli citizens, including dual nationals, must enter and depart Israel on their Israeli passports,\nand Israeli authorities may require persons whom they consider to have acquired Israeli nationality\nat birth to obtain an Israeli passport prior to departing Israel.\u201d\nThe Judge\u2019s decision says: \u201cUnder cross-examination, Applicant admitted that he could\ntravel as a non-Israeli citizen to Israel.  He would have to wait in the non-Israeli citizen line while\narriving in the country.\u201d    Decision at 3.  That is not at all what Applicant testified to.  He testified\nthat after renouncing his Israeli citizenship he would be able to enter on the non-Israeli citizen line.\nTranscript 63-64.  Here again Applicant\u2019s testimony is confirmed by the language cited above from\nGovernment Administrative Notice II.\nThe Judge\u2019s decision says: \u201cApplicant arranged for his children to obtain Israeli passports\nwhen they traveled to Israel in 2007.  They are U.S. citizens who were born in the U.S. and could\nhave used U.S. passports.  This action also indicates a preference for his home country.  While not\nalleged in the SOR under foreign preference, the Appeal Board had determined that even though\ncrucial security concerns are not alleged in the SOR, the Judge may consider those concerns when\nthey are relevant and factually related to a disqualifying condition that was alleged in the SOR.\u201d\nDecision at 8.  The Judge\u2019s premise is in error.  This was not a choice by Applicant (except to the\n\n5\nextent that they did not have to make the trip).  His children could not use U.S. passports to enter and\nexit  Israel.  Again, the language from the Government\u2019s Administrative  Notice Item II is directly\non point as well as the following language from the same paragraph: \u201cIsraeli citizens naturalized in\nthe United States retain their Israeli citizenship and children born in the United States to Israeli\nparents usually acquire both U.S. and Israeli nationality at birth.\u201d\nFinally, the Judge\u2019s decision says: \u201cHis wife traveled to Israel on her U.S. passport and had\nto go through the line for non-Israeli citizens when entering Israel.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Applicant points\nto his explicit testimony that this was a unique circumstance for which Applicant\u2019s wife had obtained\nspecial permission in the form of a one-time letter from the Israeli government. Transcript  p. 17.\nThe Judge\u2019s first decision seemed to say that Applicant was cleared on all allegations but his\npossession of a foreign passport.  The cited errors were introduced after that decision was remanded\n(on a motion of both parties) to receive evidence that Applicant had surrendered the passport. The\nJudge\u2019s third decision relies in part on a credibility determination (which is not a substitute for\nevidence\u2014 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005)), presents Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony in a mistakenly harsh light and introduces his children\u2019s circumstances, also in a\nmistakenly harsh light.  On three of the four issues the Judge\u2019s description appears to be  refuted and\nthe Applicant\u2019s testimony  confirmed by a Government exhibit offered for Administrative Notice.\nSigned: Michael Y.

In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 22 years old. He attends college full time during the school year and works part time for an employer who has contracts with the federal government. During the summer he is employed full time. He began his employment in November 2006 and was aware he would be recommended for a security clearance. He has attended college for four years, but after transferring schools he has only two years of credits. His major is Information Systems Technology. He graduated from high school in 2004.1 Applicant first used marijuana in September 2004 while he was at home for vacation from college. From September 2004 through 2005 he used marijuana with varying frequency when he came home on school breaks. He did not use it while at college. He used it with his friends from high school. He stopped using marijuana in December 2005 and resumed in the summer of 2006, again with his high school friends while at home. He used it a couple of times a week during this period. In August 2006 he moved away from home and attended a different college. He continued his marijuana use with varying frequency from December 2006 to March 2007. He used it over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods at his friend\u2019s house, again in January 2007 and again over a three-day spr",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 17, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge.

The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. They \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified and did not submit any documentary \nevidence. One witness testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on August 25, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 22 years old. He attends college full time during the school year and \nworks part time for an employer who has contracts with the federal government. During \nthe summer he is employed full time. He began his employment in November 2006 and \nwas aware he would be recommended for a security clearance. He has attended \ncollege for four years, but after transferring schools he has only two years of credits. His \nmajor is Information Systems Technology. He graduated from high school in 2004.1  \n \n \nApplicant first used marijuana in September 2004 while he was at home for \nvacation from college. From September 2004 through 2005 he used marijuana with \nvarying frequency when he came home on school breaks. He did not use it while at \ncollege. He used it with his friends from high school. He stopped using marijuana in \nDecember 2005 and resumed in the summer of 2006, again with his high school friends \nwhile at home. He used it a couple of times a week during this period. In August 2006 \nhe moved away from home and attended a different college. He continued his \nmarijuana use with varying frequency from December 2006 to March 2007. He used it \nover the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods at his friend\u2019s house, again in \nJanuary 2007 and again over a three-day spring break vacation to visit a high school \nfriend. During this three-day period he estimated he used marijuana several times a day \neach day. He stated he has not used marijuana since this trip in March 2007. In \nNovember and December 2007, on two occasions, during holiday vacations, he has \nbeen in the presence of others, high school friends, who used marijuana. Applicant has \nalso contributed money, with varying frequency, toward the purchase of marijuana. On \noccasion he would go with a friend to purchase marijuana.2  \n \n \nApplicant started using marijuana because he wanted to try it and see what it \nwas like. It made his body and mind \u201cfeel good\u201d and different. He used it with friends \nand on one occasion by himself. Applicant was aware that his use and purchase of \nmarijuana was illegal. He used it after he knew he would be applying for a security \nclearance.3 \n \n \n1 Tr. 27-36. \n \n2 Tr. 21-23. \n \n3 Tr. 35-37. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant admitted that when he was interviewed by an investigator for his \nsecurity clearance investigation that he told the investigator he was undecided about his \nintention to use marijuana in the future and he would like to use it again. Applicant \nadmitted he made the statement, but has since changed his mind about his intention to \nuse marijuana in the future. Applicant made the statement in November 2007. \nSometime in December 2007 or January 2008 he changed his mind after he began \nreflecting on his future and also the impact it had on him obtaining a security clearance. \nHe has now changed his mind and does not intend on using marijuana in the future. His \nfuture career is more important to him. He admitted that he used marijuana after being \naware that he was being put in for a security clearance.4 \n \n \nApplicant has never used any other illegal drug other than marijuana. He did \nadmit he used his stepmother\u2019s prescription painkiller without her permission on an \noccasion when he had a severe headache. He took four pills, which was more than the \nprescribed dose and had to go to the hospital. He stated he took the four pills by \naccident.5 \n \n \nApplicant has not seen his high school friends in over a year. He does \ncommunicate with one regularly that he used marijuana with, by instant messaging (IM) \non a weekly basis. This person no longer lives in the area, but does come home for \nholidays. Applicant anticipates going home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas \nholidays. He admitted others have used marijuana in his presence on two occasions \nsince he stated his intent to abstain.6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on his behalf. He has been Applicant\u2019s first level \nand second level supervisor during the time he has been employed. He considers \nApplicant to be professional and responsible. He is on time and is reliable. He trusts him \nto get the job done. He was previously unaware of Applicant\u2019s drug use and only \nbecame aware of it approximately three weeks ago when he was asked to be a witness. \nHis opinion about Applicant\u2019s work performance is unchanged, but he admitted his \npersonal opinion and respect he had for him is lower now that he knows Applicant\u2019s \nhistory.7  \n \n \nApplicant does not believe his prior drug use affects his trustworthiness or \nreliability because he is always at work on time and performs his duties. He believes his \nemployer trusts him.8  \n \n \n4 Tr. 20-22, 40-44, 49-50, 58-59. \n \n5 Tr. 59-63. This information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered \nwhen analyzing the whole person.  \n \n6 Tr. 37-40, 47. \n \n7 Tr. 67-78. \n \n8 Tr. 50-56. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \n(a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d); (c) (\u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d); and \n(h) (\u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue drug use\u201d). I conclude all of the above disqualifying conditions \napply. Appellant used marijuana from September 2004 to at least March 2007. He \ncontributed money towards the purchase of marijuana. He would go occasionally with a \nfriend to purchase marijuana. During his interview with an investigator in November \n2007, he admitted he would like to use marijuana again and had not decided definitely \nwhether or not he would. He later changed his position and affirmatively declared his \nintention not to use marijuana in the future. I find all of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply.  \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 \n26 (a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened under \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) and (b) (\u201ca demonstrated intent not to \nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (a) disassociation from drug-using associates \nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation\u201d).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last drug use was in March 2007, eighteen months ago. Not until \nDecember 2007 or January 2008, approximately eight months ago, did he make a \ncommitment not to use illegal drugs in the future. Applicant regularly communicates with \nat least one of his high school friends with whom he used drugs, although they do not \nlive in the same city any longer. Both are from the same hometown and go home for the \nholidays. Applicant used illegal drugs when he would return home and get together with \nhis high school friends. Under the circumstances I cannot find that Applicant\u2019s drug use \nwas infrequent, as it occurred during a several year period. Nor can I find that it \nhappened so far in the past, because his last use was only 18-months ago and while he \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwas working for the same employer. I also cannot find that it is unlikely to recur. It \nappears that Applicant\u2019s pattern is to use drugs when he returns home and/or visits his \nhigh school friends. There has not been a sufficient period of time to access whether \nthis part of Applicant\u2019s life is behind him. His demonstrated intent not to use drugs in the \nfuture is in its infancy. This period of abstinence must be considered along with a \ndemonstrated intent to disassociate himself from those with whom he used drugs. This \nis not to say that Applicant can no longer be friends with his high school friends. \nHowever, it does require a certain level of maturity that recognizes if his high school \nfriends continue to use drugs he can not partake nor associate with them or be in their \npresence when they do so. On two occasions Applicant was in the presence of people \nusing drugs, certainly a risk situation. I have questions whether Applicant will be able to \nresist the temptation and use good judgment to extricate himself from a situation that \nmay involve his friends and their continued use of drugs. It does not appear he has \ndone this in the past, even after he made his commitment to abstain. Therefore, I find \nnone of the above mitigating conditions apply. It is too soon to determine if Applicant\u2019s \ncommitment to refrain from drug use is permanent. There is a certain level of maturity \nthat comes with having a security clearance. Clearly, Applicant is a valued and trusted \nemployee, but I am not convinced that he has made the transition to mature responsible \nadult in all aspects of his life.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man who is \nworking while also attending college. He has a history of using marijuana from 2004 to \n2007. He knowingly used marijuana while employed and after he was aware he was he \nwas being recommended by his employer for a security clearance. Applicant primarily \nused marijuana when he went back home and with high school friends. He still \nmaintains regular contact with at least one friend. Although he clearly understood that \nhis use and purchase of marijuana was illegal he did not appear to grasp the security \nconcerns raised regarding his drug use and the trustworthiness, reliability and judgment \nissues. Insufficient time has elapsed to access Applicant\u2019s commitment to abstinence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nE, Personal Conduct. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n \nAugust 16, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 29, 2010, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) on May 6, 2010. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, and he \nreceived it on March 15, 2010. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant submitted a reply that \nwas received by DOHA on June 16, 2010. The case was assigned to me on July 2, \n2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.f, and denied 1.g. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 26 years old. He is single and has no children. Since June 2007, he \nhas worked as a security guard for a defense contractor.1 He served on active duty in \nthe Navy as an enlisted member from May 2002 until February 2005. He was \ninvoluntarily discharged from the Navy for a pattern of misconduct. He received a \ngeneral (under honorable conditions) discharge.2   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted conduct raised in the SOR includes: (1) receiving nonjudicial \npunishment (Captain\u2019s Mast) in 2004, for a variety of offenses including, unauthorized \nabsence, missing movement, underage drinking, making a false statement, and altering \na document; (2) receiving nonjudicial punishment (Captain\u2019s Mast) in 2005, for a variety \nof offenses including, unauthorized absence, underage drinking, driving while impaired, \nand wrongful appropriation of a vehicle and other property; (3) being discharged from \nthe Navy on February 28, 2005, with a general discharge due to a pattern of \nmisconduct; (4) being arrested in 2006,  and pleading guilty to disturbing the peace in \nSt. Joseph, Missouri; (5) altering a doctor\u2019s note in February 2007, and providing the \nforged note to his employer to support an absence from work; and, (6) resigning from \nhis job in February 2007, after allegations of misconduct because of the forged doctor\u2019s \nnote provided to his employer.3 \n \n \n \nIn explanation, Applicant attributes his misconduct in the Navy was attributed to \nhis alcohol dependency. He further states that he requested treatment from the Navy, \nbut because of impending deployments he was never allowed to enroll in any alcohol \ntreatment programs. Applicant also claims he saw a counselor at Pearl Harbor but had \nto deploy soon thereafter and received no follow-on treatment.4 When interviewed by an \ninvestigator for his security clearance in December 2007, Applicant stated he did not \n                                                          \n1 Item 5. \n \n2 Item 6. \n \n3 Items 4, 6, 9, 10 \n \n4 Item 4: Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhave an alcohol problem and continues to drink alcohol. There is no other evidence in \nthe record concerning alcohol counseling or treatment for Applicant.5 \n \n \nApplicant relates that his post-Navy conduct of disturbing the peace was caused \nby drinking to much alcohol after graduating from a course he attended. Additionally, he \nadmits to using \u201cvery bad judgment\u201d when he chose to alter a doctor\u2019s note that he gave \nto his employer to cover an absence from work. He explained that he didn\u2019t have \ninsurance at the time and couldn\u2019t afford to go to the doctor. Because he needed a \ndoctor\u2019s note to return to work, he altered an earlier doctor\u2019s note by changing the dates \nand submitting it to his employer. When confronted by his employer, he resigned from \nhis position. Applicant also claims he did not intentionally omit his 2005 nonjudicial \npunishment from his security clearance application completed in June 2007. He states \nthat by then he had moved on with his life and forgot the details about the event.6  \n \n \nApplicant presented two Navy fitness reports for the years 2002-2003 and 2003-\n2004. Overall Applicant was a sailor who met Navy standards and was described by his \nrating officials as a \u201cvital asset\u201d, a \u201ckey player\u201d, and someone who performed his duties \nin an exceptional manner with pride and professionalism.7 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n                                                          \n5 Item 8. \n \n6 Item 4; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n\n \n5 \n \n \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nd) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of behavior, both while in the Navy and more recently while \nworking in the civilian world, call into question his judgment, honesty and ability to follow \nrules. He was discharged from the Navy for a pattern of misconduct that included \nreceiving discipline for under age drinking on two occasions, altering a document and \nmaking false official statement, among other things. Since he left the Navy, he resigned \nfrom a job because he altered a doctor\u2019s note. All these actions represent a pattern of \ndishonesty and a lack of integrity calling into question Applicant\u2019s fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b616(c), 16(d), and 16(e) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f. \nWhen Applicant completed his June 2007, SF-86, he failed to list his January \n2005, nonjudicial punishment. However, this does not prove Applicant deliberately failed \n\n \n6 \n \n \nto disclose information about his Captain\u2019s Mast. Applicant listed his earlier nonjudicial \npunishment received in 2004. Applicant denied any intentional falsification. Deliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral \nstatement to the Government, when applying for a security clearance, is a security \nconcern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification must be \ndeliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. When \nApplicant completed his SF-86, he failed to remember his second nonjudicial \npunishment. I am persuaded that Appellant was not attempting to deceive the \ngovernment when he neglected to list this information. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g.   \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions in repeatedly breaking rules while in the Navy and engaging \nin behavior involving dishonesty, both in and out of the Navy, casts doubt on his overall \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have considered Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \npositive fitness reports, written six and seven years ago, and his explanation that \nalcohol indulgence contributed to the problems he experienced while in the Navy. \nHowever, I also considered that a significant number of Applicant\u2019s acts involved \naspects of dishonesty (false statements, altering documents, wrongful appropriation, \nand providing a false doctor\u2019s note). These acts are numerous and extend over a \nconsiderable time frame. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 55, married, and has a master\u2019s degree. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Applicant has worked for his current employer since 2006. All of the incidents alleged in the SOR occurred during his employment with another defense contractor [Company]. He was employed by the Company for 27 years, until December 2005. Paragraph 1 (Guideline K - Handling Protected Information) The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is not eligible for a security clearance because he has committed security violations. Subparagraph 1.a. The Applicant\u2019s first security violation occurred on November 3, 2003. This violation was for misplacing the key to a classified storage area and departing the area before resolution of the incident. The key was found in the Applicant\u2019s office. The Applicant had to leave the area in order to pick up his six-year old son at a bus stop. (Government Exhibit 5, Exhibit 7 at 4; Transcript II at 11-14, 58- 60.)1 Subparagraph 1.b. The Applicant\u2019s second security violation occurred in June 2004. The Applicant had a camera pass, which allowed him to take photographs at a Company facility. Areas in this facility contained classified material. On this occasion, he took a photograph of a part of a device, which he believed to be unclassified. However, he also knew that documentation showed the part to be classified, even though it was not. The f",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant:\nKenneth M. Roberts, Esquire\nNovember 10, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing on May 23, 2006 (Government Exhibit 1). On October 14, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guidelines K (handling protected\ninformation), E (personal conduct), and M (misuse of information technology). The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\nThe transcript of the March 27, 2009, hearing will be identified as \u201cTranscript I at xx.\u201d The transcript of the\n1\nOctober 2, 2009, hearing will be identified as \u201cTranscript II at xx.\u201d\n2\nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on November 5, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on December\n12, 2008. DOHA issued an original notice of hearing on December 16, 2008, and\nhearings were held on March 27, 2009, and October 2, 2009. The Government offered\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 10, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf, called three additional witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through V, and X, without objection. The post-hearing brief of the Applicant\nwas marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits W for identification only. DOHA received the final\ntranscript of the hearing on October 13, 2009. The record closed on that date. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 55, married, and has a master\u2019s degree. He is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment. The Applicant has worked for his current employer since 2006. All of the\nincidents alleged in the SOR occurred during his employment with another defense\ncontractor [Company]. He was employed by the Company for 27 years, until December\n2005.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline K - Handling Protected Information)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is not eligible for a\nsecurity clearance because he has committed security violations.\nSubparagraph 1.a. The Applicant\u2019s first security violation occurred on November\n3, 2003. This violation was for misplacing the key to a classified storage area and\ndeparting the area before resolution of the incident. The key was found in the\nApplicant\u2019s office. The Applicant had to leave the area in order to pick up his six-year\nold son at a bus stop. (Government Exhibit 5, Exhibit 7 at 4; Transcript II at 11-14, 58-\n60.)1\n \nSubparagraph 1.b. The Applicant\u2019s second security violation occurred in June\n2004. The Applicant had a camera pass, which allowed him to take photographs at a\nCompany facility. Areas in this facility contained classified material. On this occasion, he\ntook a photograph of a part of a device, which he believed to be unclassified. However,\nhe also knew that documentation showed the part to be classified, even though it was\nnot. The facility security officer stated that the Applicant was advised \u201cwhen in doubt do\nnot take the picture.\u201d The part the Applicant took the picture of was later determined to\nbe unclassified. (Government Exhibit 7 at 4, Exhibit 9; Transcript I at 101-104, 181-185;\nTranscript II at 14-19, 60-62; 100-107.)\n\nSee also Transcript I at 235-238, 257-260.\n2\n3\nSubparagraph 1.c. The Applicant\u2019s third security violation occurred in March\n2005.  This violation also involved the Applicant taking a photograph of a different part\nof the same device. Once again the Applicant thought, but did not know, that the part\nwas unclassified. As before, this part was also shown in documentation to be classified.\nThe incident report submitted by the facility security officer states that the Applicant was\ntold \u201cif he had any doubts an item was classified he was to have it authorized by a\nclassifier before taking the picture.\u201d The part was subsequently determined to be\nunclassified. (Government Exhibit 4 at 1, Exhibit 7 at 4; Transcript I at 185-188;\nTranscript II at 18-22, 62-65, 107-109.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s Team Lead at the time of the events set forth under 1.b. and 1.c.,\nabove, testified that he was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201caghast\u201d that these events resulted in\nsecurity violations being lodged against the Applicant. The witness explained in detail\nwhy he felt that these were not true violations and that the facility security officer did not\nunderstand how the camera pass system worked. (Transcript I at 182-185.)2\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in conduct which shows questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n2.a. The Applicant\u2019s conduct, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, will also be\nexamined under Guideline E.\n2.b. The Applicant admits that he installed personally-owned software on his\ncompany supplied computer sometime in 2005. He further stated that the software was\nAdobe Acrobat, and he removed it after being informed by the company IT (Information\nTechnology) manager that unapproved software was not allowed on his computer.\n(Government Exhibit 3 at 1, and Exhibit 10; Transcript I at 111-112, 188-191; Transcript\nII at 22-28, 65-71.)\nThe Applicant did not admit at any time that he had installed other personally-\nowned software on his company computer. Specifically, software that would allow him\nto remove personal emails from his account and therefore \u201cscrub\u201d it. However, as\nfurther described under subparagraph 2.f., below, he did admit to deleting emails from\nhis account, but through another method. In addition, no evidence was submitted by\neither side identifying any computer software program that would act in this fashion.\nBased on the state of the record, I find that this allegation is not proven as alleged.\nAccordingly, subparagraph 2.b. is found for the Applicant.\n2.c., 2.d., 2.e., and 2.f. These four subparagraphs refer to a course of events,\ninvolving the Applicant\u2019s termination from the Company, and the aftermath. In order to\nprovide continuity, they will be discussed together.\n\nSee Exhibit Y at 2.\n3\n4\nThe Applicant was in charge of a building for the Company. Classified hardware\nwas worked on in this building. On June 2, 2005, a piece of classified hardware came\ninto the building. A particular part of this hardware contained an explosive charge. The\nbuilding could only work on inert components. In other words, while explosive material\ncould be in the building, it could not be worked on. The normal course of events for this\npiece of hardware was to return it to the vendor, which was not the Company, when\nwork had to be done on the part containing the explosive charge. (Transcript I at 112-\n116, 151-152, 192-193, 201-202, 260-264.)\nThe Applicant gave instructions regarding the handling of the part containing the\nexplosive charge that were, evidently, incorrect. In fact, the Applicant admitted at the\nhearing that his instructions had been \u201ca mistake.\u201d (Transcript at 112.) These\ninstructions were recorded in a computer generated report (Report). (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nY.) Written copies of this Report, including the Applicant\u2019s instructions, were printed up\nfor the file. The Applicant then left for the evening after giving his instructions. Later that\nday, the Applicant\u2019s instructions were superseded by his Team Lead and the situation\nwas reported as a possible ordnance incident. It was emphasized by the Applicant, and\ntwo witnesses who worked with him at the Company at the time, that an unsafe situation\nnever developed. (Government Exhibit 7 at 1-3; Transcript I at 122, 193-200, 264-267;\nTranscript II at 28-37, 72-74, 109-114.) \nThe next day, the Applicant was informed that his instructions resulted in a\npossible ordnance incident. In his own words, \u201cAnd I at that point became very scared.\u201d\n(Transcript II at 35.) \nAt this time, the Applicant\u2019s Lead instructed the Applicant to update the Report to\nshow what had happened concerning the work on the part after the Applicant had gone\nhome. (Transcript I at 203-206, 255; Transcript II at 37-40.) In doing this, according to\nthe Applicant, he noticed that the Report still had his instructions from the previous\nevening. As stated earlier, those instructions were superseded. The Applicant testified\nconcerning his conduct at that time:\nAll I did was delete that paragraph. Those four lines on the [Report]\nScreen to show the true course of events because that\u2019s what we always\ndid was we dispositioned all our failures to show exactly what happened in\nthe time sequence that they did happen. And that did not happen.  You\n3\nknow, in hindsight, I probably would have just put a parenthesis line below\nthat, stating that the specific paragraph was not performed. But it was like\ndrawing lines through a written Disposition and initialling (sic) it, except in\nthis system, you couldn\u2019t draw lines through text. (Transcript II at 39-40.)\nThe Applicant further stated, \u201cThere would have been any number of ways to\nhandle it other than the way I did. At the time, I thought I was just stating the true course\nof events. . . . At the time, I felt I wasn\u2019t - - there was no intent to defraud is the best I\n\nSee Transcript at 74-79.\n4\nSee also Transcript I at 238-241.\n5\nGovernment Exhibit 2 is the Adverse Information Report submitted by the Company to the Government.\n6\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit V consists of  the Applicant\u2019s copies of termination documents. The record does not contain\nany of the internal reports of the Company concerning any of the incidents involving the Applicant. It is noted\nthat the documents in the record contain different dates of termination for the Applicant: January 2, 2006;\nJanuary 3, 2006; and January 6, 2006. (See Transcript I at 5-9.)\n5\ncan say.\u201d (Transcript II at 79.)  Finally, the Applicant printed up the new Report and\n4\nreplaced the ones from the prior night. He threw the old ones away. (Transcript II at\n111-119.)5\nShortly afterwards, an investigation commenced into the Applicant\u2019s conduct with\nregards to the ordnance incident. This investigation continued until December 2005. On\nDecember 22, 2005, the Applicant was terminated from his employment with the\nCompany, allegedly because of his conduct with regards to the ordnance incident. This\ntermination had an effective date of January 2, 2006.  (Government Exhibit 2;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit V; Transcript II at 80-88.)6\nThe Applicant was escorted from the Company\u2019s facility on December 22, 2005,\nand did not return there again. (Transcript at 88.) The Adverse Information Report\nstates that the Applicant \u201cwas instructed to return company credit card and Secure ID\nfor [remote computer access] since those items were at his home. He was instructed to\nhave his spouse return them on 23 Dec 05, however, they were not returned until 3 Jan\n06.\u201d (Government Exhibit 2.) \nThe Applicant disputes this version of events. He testified that he informed the\nCompany that his wife, who also worked for the Company, would return the items on\nJanuary 3, 2006. According to the Applicant, they were returned on that day. (Transcript\nII at 42-45, 86-87, 119-120.)\nThe Applicant admits that, during the period from December 22, 2005, to January\n3, 2006, he obtained remote access to the Company\u2019s internal network. This was\nthrough the use of the Secure ID he was supposed to return. He further stated that,\nduring this time, he sent personal email to co-workers and deleted what he describes as\npersonal emails. He did not have authorization from anyone to access the system\nremotely. (Transcript II at 45-46, 69-71, 88-90, 121-122.)\nThe Company\u2019s IT Manager was authorized to access the Applicant\u2019s email\naccount to capture any email sent or received after the date of his termination,\nDecember 22, 2005. In an email report, dated January 3, 2006, he states that \u201cNo e-\nmail messages were found in [the Applicant\u2019s Company] Exchange Sent, Deleted, Junk\nE-mail, Journal, Notes, Outbox, Sync, Search or Draft folders.\u201d (Government Exhibit 3 at\n10.)\n\n6\nThe Applicant further admitted that, late on the afternoon of January 3, 2006, he\naccessed the Company\u2019s virtual private network for another reason. That is when he\ndownloaded a copy of Applicant\u2019s Exhibit Y, the Report. He had no authorization from\nanybody to do this last event. In fact, the Applicant admitted that he did it in expectation\nof filing a law suit against the Company for wrongful termination. (Transcript at 90-93.)\nParagraph 3 (Guideline M - Misuse of Information Technology)\nThe Government alleges in this Paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used information technology in an inappropriate manner,\nthereby showing poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness.\n3.a.  The Applicant\u2019s conduct as set forth in subparagraphs 2.b., 2.d., and 2.f.,\nabove, will be examined under this Guideline as well.\nMitigation\nThe Applicant is a highly educated, respected professional in his field. He has\nmany years of experience in the defense industry, which is reflected in the many awards\nhe has received for his work. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)\nThe current supervisor of the Applicant testified at the hearing. He has\nknowledge of the incidents concerning the Applicant at the Company. With that\nknowledge, he states, \u201cI would recommend that the Security Clearance be granted. I\nhave seen no indications of any issue at all in [the Applicant\u2019s] performance and ability\nto follow the rules and maintain the requirements for a Clearance.\u201d (Transcript I at 72.)\nAs stated earlier, the Applicant\u2019s Team Lead and his Manager from his time at\nthe Company also testified on his behalf. They both testified that the Applicant is\nqualified to hold a security clearance. (Transcript I at 132, 210.)\nThe Applicant also submitted laudatory letters of reference from co-workers at his\ncurrent employer (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits M and N), co-workers from his years at the\nCompany (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits J, K, L, N, O, Q and U), as well as relatives and friends\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits R, S and T). He is described as someone with \u201cpersonal integrity,\u201d\nwho \u201calways took his responsibilities seriously.\u201d One co-worker described the Applicant\nas \u201cdependable, reliable, hard-working and conscientious.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L.) All of\nthe letters are in this vein.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\n\n7\nmitigating conditions, which are to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n8\nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline K - Handling Protected Information)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information\nis set out in AG & 33:      \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations\nfor protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about\nan individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and\nability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\n(Emphasis supplied.)\nThe Applicant has three security violations over a period of three years, 2003,\n2004 and 2005.  I find that the following disqualifying conditions apply under Guideline\nK: \u00b6 34(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other\nsensitive information; and \u00b6 34(h) negligence or lax security habits that persist despite\ncounseling by management.\nThere are three mitigating conditions that arguably apply to the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct under Guideline K.  They are \u00b6 35(a) so much time has elapsed since the\nbehavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \u00b6 35(b) the individual responded favorably to\ncounseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude\ntoward the discharge of security responsibilities; and \u00b6 35(c) the security violations were\ndue to improper or inadequate training.\nConcerning cases such as this, the DOHA Appeal Board has stated, \u201cA person\nwho has committed security violations has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that\nthey should be entrusted with classified information. Because security violations strike\nat the heart of the industrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any\nclaims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 00-0030 (Appeal\nBoard, September 20, 2001).)  In the same case, the Appeal Board further says that the\nGovernment has a compelling interest in protecting classified information from\ndisclosure to unauthorized persons, regardless of whether the disclosure is the result of\ndeliberate or negligent conduct\nThe Applicant\u2019s conduct with the missing key can be put down to a parent\u2019s\nconcern for a child. It obviously was an aberration from his normal procedure with\nregards to the key. Based on the state of the record, it has little if any security\nsignificance.\nConcerning the classified photography, the evidence is mixed. Clearly, the\nprocedures set out by the facility security officer in the reports of the Applicant\u2019s conduct\ndo not comport with what his supervisors state the facts are. In addition, there was\nconfusion about whether he actually did take any pictures of classified material. Based\n\nAs stated above, Subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. are found for the Applicant.\n7\nFor purposes of this Decision, I am viewing the term \u201coffense\u201d as including all of the actions of the Applicant.\n8\nNo criminal or dishonest conduct is implied to the Applicant in the use of this term.\n9\non the state of the record, and acknowledging the Applicant\u2019s burden under this\nGuideline, I find that he has mitigated the security significance of his conduct.\nParagraph 1 is found for the Applicant, as is subparagraph 2.a.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern relating to Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules or regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nThe entirety of the Applicant\u2019s conduct at the Company, as set forth under\nParagraph 2, arguably brings into play disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(c) under Guideline E:\ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as\na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information.  \n7\nThe following mitigating condition under Guideline E arguably applies to his\nconduct: 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.8\nThe Applicant made serious errors in judgment with regards to the piece of\nclassified hardware, how he worked on it, and what he did after he was terminated.\nDespite his protestations, and those of his witnesses, his employer of 27 years felt that\nhis conduct was of a sufficient seriousness to justify termination. I need not decide\nwhether his instructions with regards to the classified piece of hardware were correct or\nnot. Rather, I find that his entire course of conduct, including after that event, shows\nextremely poor judgement, unreliability and untrustworthiness.\nFirst, the Applicant changed the Report in an inappropriate manner. He states\nthat nothing of importance was deleted, but I do not have his prior Report in the record\nand do not find him credible on this point. In reviewing the evidence, he knew that he\nwas in trouble and I find that he amended the report to portray his conduct in the best\npossible light.\n\nThe facts set out under Subparagraph 2.b. do not have application under this Guideline.\n9\n10\nSecond, his post-termination conduct was completely inappropriate. He knew\nthat he had been terminated and that he was no longer employed at the Company. The\nApplicant argues that the effective date was January 2, 2006. That is a thin reed to\njustify his conduct in remotely accessing the Company\u2019s computer system to clean up\nhis email accounts and download Applicant\u2019s Exhibit Y. The Applicant admits that he\nhad not asked permission from anyone to engage in this conduct.  \nI have considered the span of time that has passed since these events. While\nnormally it would be mitigating, the Applicant continues to attempt to justify his conduct.\nI am not convinced that he would not act in the same way again if he felt that he was in\nthe right. I must be convinced that the Applicant has truly changed his ways and will\nshow good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regards to all of his security\nresponsibilities in the future. I am not so convinced. I find against the Applicant with\nregards to Guideline E. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline M - Misuse of Information Technology)\nThe security concern with regards to the Misuse of Information Technology is set\nout in AG \u00b6 39:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations\npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability or trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nThe Applicant\u2019s admitted conduct with regards to the Company\u2019s computer\nsystem provides support for the application of the following disqualifying conditions\nunder Guideline M: \u00b6 40(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology\nsystem or component thereof; \u00b6 40(b) illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction,\nmanipulation or denial of access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an\ninformation technology system; \u00b6 40(c) use of any information technology system to\ngain unauthorized access to another system or to a compartmented area within the\nsame system; and \u00b6 40(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information\ntechnology system.\nThe Applicant\u2019s conduct, as set forth above under subparagraphs 2.b. and 2.f.,\nare cognizable under this paragraph as well.  I have examined the Applicant\u2019s\n9\nexplanations and find them wanting. Even though it has been several years since he\nengaged in this inappropriate conduct, I find that it continues to cast doubt on the\nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Accordingly, the mitigating\ncondition set forth under \u00b6 41(a) is not applicable.\n\n11\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nhighly respected, and valuable member of the defense industry.  I have carefully\nconsidered all the potential mitigating evidence in this case, including the laudatory\npersonal opinions of his superiors and co-workers at the Company, and his current\nemployer.  \nThe Applicant, before and after his termination from the Company, acted\ninappropriately. In particular, he changed a report to lessen his culpability in a serious\nincident, and after his termination at least twice gained remote access to the Company\u2019s\ncomputer system for his own purposes. This is obviously serious conduct that he\nengaged in knowingly and voluntarily. Based on the current state of the record, I find\nthat there is insufficient evidence of rehabilitation or other permanent behavioral\nchanges. I also find that there is the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\ninappropriate personal conduct and misuse of information systems.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. As stated above, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.\n\n12\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline M:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on June 4, 2007. On December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 3, 2009, and on March 20, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on May 1, 2009. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009. On June 1, \n2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for June 15, 2009. The \ncase was heard on that date. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted \nas Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant testified and offered four exhibits \nwhich were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D. The record was \nJune 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nheld open until June 30, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  She \ntimely submitted a three-page document that was admitted as AE E. The transcript was \nreceived on June 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  She has been employed as an electronic technician with \nher company since April 2005. From 1998 to 2003, she served on active duty in the \nUnited States Marine Corps. She separated as an E-4 with an Honorable Discharge. \nShe attends college part-time. She is married and has three children, ages 9, 8, and 5. \n(Tr at 5-7, 21, 35; Gov 1; AE E at 2)  \n \nOn June 4, 2007, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions \n(SF 86) in order to apply for a security clearance. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d in response \nto question 28(a) \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d She also answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 28(b) \u201cAre you currently over \n90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d (Gov 1)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant has the following \ndelinquent accounts: a $1,149 debt owed to an apartment that was placed for collection \nin July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at 13; Gov 5 at 1); a $445 medical bill placed for \ncollection in October 2006, date of last activity on the account was January 2002 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 11; Gov 5 at 1); a $3,095 credit card that was charged off in May 2007, \ndate of last activity on the account was November 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 4 at 16; Gov 5 \nat 2); a $3,747 credit card account that was charged off in May 2007, date of last activity \non the account was September 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 4 at 4); a $5,900 credit card \naccount that was charged off in April 2007, date of last activity on the account was \nFebruary 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 4 at 6); a $960 credit card account that was charged off \nin December 2006, date of last activity on the account was January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: \nGov 4 at 7); and a $367 account placed for collection in January 2008, date of last \nactivity on the account was October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 5 at 3). \n \nAdditional delinquent debts include: a $580 department store account placed for \ncollection in May 2007, date of last activity on the account was January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h: Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 3); a $5,935 credit card account placed for collection in May \n2007, date of last activity on the account was February 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 4 at 10, \n16; Gov 5 at 3); a $5,543 credit card account placed for collection in May 2007, date of \nlast activity on the account is October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 4 at 10, 16; Gov 5 at 3); a \n$4,709 department store credit card account placed for collection in May 2007, date of \nlast activity on the account was January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 4 at 9-10, 16; Gov 5 at \n3); a $1,916 credit card account placed for collection in May 2007, date of last activity \non the account was July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 4 at 9-10; Gov 5 at 3) a $10,946 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nelectronics account placed for collection in June 2007, date of last activity on the \naccount is February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 4 at 14; Gov 5 at 3); a $1,510 credit card \naccount placed for collection in May 2007, date of last activity on the account is \nNovember 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 4 at 7); and a $9,299 account placed for collection in \nMay 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 4 at 14: this a duplicate of SOR \u00b61.m). \n \nApplicant denied all of the debts alleged in the SOR. She denies the debt owed \nto the apartment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a because she disputes the amount of the debt \nowed. She signed a lease in 2003. After a year, Applicant claims, she paid extra to go \non a month to month lease. The apartment company claims that she vacated the lease \nearly. They kept her security deposit which is the equivalent of one month\u2019s rent. She \ndid not leave a forwarding address when she moved. (Tr at 28-30)  \n \nApplicant claims all of the remaining debts are debts her mother obtained using \nher identity. Her mother used Applicant\u2019s identity because she had poor credit. \nApplicant discovered that her mother used her identity to obtain credit in the fall 2002. \nApplicant was on active duty in the Marine Corps and a creditor called her inquiring \nabout a debt. She obtained a copy of her credit report in 2002 or 2003. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report lists her mother\u2019s maiden name. Applicant claims she never used her \nmother\u2019s maiden name to obtain credit. She also never used her hometown address to \nobtain credit. Her mother\u2019s maiden name and her hometown address appear on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report.  Her mother initially denied that she used Applicant\u2019s identity to \nobtain credit, but later admitted it and said that she would pay the accounts. She has \nnot paid off any of the accounts. Mother and daughter rarely communicate. (Tr at 22-26, \n31) \n \nApplicant did not notify the credit bureaus that she was a victim of identity theft. \nShe never reported her mother to the police. Her mother asked her not to file a report \nbecause she was afraid of getting sued. She last spoke with her mother briefly in \nDecember 2008, but does not speak with her on a regular basis. (Tr at 27-28)  \n \nApplicant provided a copy of her husband\u2019s credit report, dated June 10, 2009. \n(AE D) She claims that she and her husband use his credit. They have no recent \ndelinquent debts. They own their home, two cars, and do not have very many debts. All \nof their accounts are current. Her husband works two full-time jobs. After expenses, \nthey have approximately $3,000 left over each month. They are current on federal \nincome taxes.  They have always lived within their means. (Tr at 34-37; Gov 3 at 4) \nApplicant has approximately $40,000 in investments. She has approximately $6,700 in \nher savings account. (AE A; AE C)  \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant denies that she intentionally failed to list \nher financial delinquencies in response to questions 28(a) and 28(b)of the security \nquestionnaire that she completed on June 23, 2007. (Tr at 35-37.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager wrote a letter on her behalf. He indicates Applicant performs \ntechnical test operations on classified hardware and handles classified data. She has \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndemonstrated that she is intelligent, trustworthy and reliable. She quickly learned test \nprocedures, equipment, and criteria. He notes Applicant is \u201cpeople oriented and \neasygoing.\u201d Applicant always acts in a professional and ethical manner. (AE E at 3) \nApplicant also does well in school. (AE A; AE B.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s credit reports lists 15 \ndelinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $56,101. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions are \nrelevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant has significant amount of debt \nthat is several years old. With the exception of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the debts \nwere incurred by her mother using Applicant\u2019s personal information. Applicant and her \nhusband use his credit rating. His credit report indicates no delinquent accounts. \nApplicant\u2019s credit was ruined by her mother. She currently has $40,000 in investments. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nHer manager vouches for her integrity and reliability. Applicant\u2019s poor credit history does \nnot cast doubt on her current trustworthiness, reliability, or good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant\u2019s mother used \nher identity to open numerous financial accounts. Applicant discovered that her mother \nwas using her identity in 2002. However, she has taken no steps to protect herself \nagainst her mother using her identity to obtain more credit. She has taken no action to \ncorrect her credit reports. She has not reported her mother\u2019s use of her identity to the \ncredit reporting agencies. Applicant admits that she rented an apartment from the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. She disputes the debt but has not formally disputed the account \non her credit report. While I acknowledge the delicate position Applicant is placed and \nher reluctance to report her mother to the police, her lack of action towards protecting \nher credit from further abuse is irresponsible. For this reason, this mitigating condition is \ngiven less weight.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s mother used her identity to obtain all of the financial \naccounts that are listed in the SOR. She did not provide documented proof that her \nmother actually used her credit to steal her identity. Her mother\u2019s maiden name and her \nchildhood address are listed on the credit report. However, this is not conclusive that \nher mother opened accounts using Applicant\u2019s identity without her knowledge. Credit \nreports occasionally list the individual\u2019s past addresses. Applicant has been aware of \nher mother\u2019s identity theft since 2002, but has not taken steps to resolve the issue or \nprotect her identity from further abuse.   \n \nWeighing all of the factors under the specific facts of Applicant\u2019s case, to include \nher mother\u2019s identity theft, the work ethic of Applicant and her husband and their \nfinancial stability, I conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list her  \nfinancial delinquencies in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on her security \nclearance questionnaire, dated June 4, 2007.    \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of her delinquent \naccounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. In her answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denies that she intentionally falsified her security clearance questionnaire. I \nfind her explanation credible.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern is found for Applicant.  \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s manager. I considered her honorable service in the United \nStates Marine Corps. I considered that most of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were the \nresult of her mother using her identity without Applicant\u2019s knowledge. Applicant provided \nsubstantial evidence that she and her husband are financially stable. She works full-\ntime, raises three children and attends college part-time. Her husband works two full-\ntime jobs.  While Applicant could have been more proactive in protecting her identity \nfrom future abuse, considering the particular facts of this case and based solely on the \nwhole person factors, Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised. However,  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant is warned that she must take steps to protect her identity from further abuse \nand to formally dispute the items on her credit report with the credit agencies in order to \nprevent her poor credit history from being raised as a security concern in future security \nclearance investigations. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated because Applicant \ndid not intend to falsify her security clearance application. Under the particular facts of \nthis case and in consideration of the whole person factors, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues do not create a security risk.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Minster, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised under Guideline F,\nfinancial considerations. Clearance is denied.\nOn February 22, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 12, 2010, admitted all of the allegations\nand requested an administrative determination. On April 21, 2010, Department Counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant received it on April 27, 2009,\nand was instructed to file any objections or additional information within 30 days of\nreceipt. She did not reply. On July 7, 2010, the case was assigned to me.\nOctober 27, 2010\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 60-year-old single woman with one adult child. She is divorced.\nShe has a high school diploma. For the past two years, she has worked as a travel\nassistant/voucher examiner. \nApplicant has a history of troubled finances. In 1997, she filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy protection. (Item 4 at 1-10) She listed $117,000 of secured debt, which\nconstituted the primary and secondary mortgage on her home. In 1999, the home was\nforeclosed, and the following year, the court dismissed the bankruptcy without granting\nApplicant a discharge of her debts. (Item 4 at 1) \nBetween 1999 and 2008, Applicant accrued approximately $118,000 of\ndelinquent debt, including $14,200 of debt that is not listed on the SOR, a $325 medical\nbill (SOR subparagraph 1.l), $66,000 of unpaid federal income taxes from tax years\n2000 to 2003 (SOR subparagraphs 1.c -1.f), $42,000 of income tax delinquencies owed\nto two state taxing authorities (SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.g - 1.i, 1.k), and a judgment\nfor unpaid business property taxes totalling $2,784 owed to a municipal taxing authority\n(SOR subparagraph 1.j) \nApplicant alluded to a health crisis in 2004, but provided no details. The record\ndoes indicate, however, that Applicant was unemployed between January 1997 and\nJanuary 1999 and November 2005 and November 2006.    (Item 5 at 14)\nOver the past two years, Applicant has been attempting to satisfy her debts.\nSpecifically, she satisfied the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.l. (Item 4 at 32) As for\nthe $14,200 of unlisted debts, approximately 80 percent constitutes a delinquent car\nnote. (Item 9 at 12) In September 2008, she negotiated a reduction in the payoff amount\nto $5,952, and has been making monthly payments since then. It is no longer in a\ndelinquent status. (Item 9 at 12-14) She satisfied the remaining $3,000 of unlisted\ndebts. (Id.) \nIn August 2009, the United States Internal Revenue Service garnished\nApplicant\u2019s wages. Through the garnishment, Applicant has been paying $778 monthly\ntoward her federal income tax delinquency. (Item 12 at 18-21) As of February 2010, she\nhad paid $5,064 toward the delinquency. \n Applicant owes approximately $38,000 of her state income tax delinquency to\nState 1 and the remainder to State 2.  The State 1 income tax delinquency is for tax\nyears 1999 through 2004 and 2007. (Item 4 at 7) Applicant provided documentation\ndated December 9, 2008 from the State 1 taxing authority detailing a payment plan\nagreement under which Applicant was to pay $1,589 monthly beginning in February\n2009. (Item 7 at 5) She provided no proof that she initiated the proposed plan. She did,\nhowever, provide proof of two payments, totalling $270, that she made in May 2009.\n(Item 7 at 7)\n\n3\nThe $3,755 income tax delinquency Applicant owes to State 2 is for tax years\n2005 and 2006. (Item 4 at 11-15) In May 2009, Applicant crafted a payment plan under\nwhich she will pay State 2 $100 monthly. Consistent with the plan, she made the first\npayment that month. (Id.) She provided no evidence of any additional payments.\nAs for the judgment that Applicant owes to a municipality, a representative\ncontacted her In March 2010, offering to reduce the delinquency to $1,500, provided\nApplicant pay $200 immediately and the balance within 60 days of receipt of the offer.\n(Item 4 at 43) Applicant made the initial payment. (Id.) She provided no evidence of any\nadditional payments.\nAs of May 2007, Applicant earns $51,607 annually, and her after-expense\nincome totalled $2,643 monthly. (Item 9 at 4) Applicant provided this after-expense\nincome estimate to a security clearance investigator before she had implemented any of\nher income tax payment plans.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied\ntogether with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the\nentire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person\nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion for obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\n\n4\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies\ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and\n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nTwo lengthy periods of unemployment and a health crisis contributed to\nApplicant\u2019s financial troubles. Given the nature of the debts that she allowed to become\ndelinquent (federal, state, and local taxes) and the length of time that they remained in\ndelinquent status, I cannot conclude that she acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d does not apply.\nIn 2008, Applicant began contacting creditors whom she owed approximately\n$14,200 of debt that is not listed in the SOR. Since then, she has been paying them\nsteadily. Currently, these unlisted debts are either satisfied or no longer in delinquent\nstatus.\nSince 2009, Applicant has reduced her federal income tax deficiency by\napproximately $5,000 through monthly payments. She satisfied the delinquency listed in\nSOR subparagraph 1.l, negotiated a payment plan with State 1, made payments toward\nthe debt owed to State 2, and made a payment to the municipality toward the\nsatisfaction of the delinquent business property tax.\nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing predated her tax delinquencies. Her\nfederal income tax payments occurred through a garnishment. Also, she failed to\ncomply with the State 1 payment plan, and her progress in satisfying the remaining\ndelinquencies has been marginal. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies, but not\nAG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n5\nApplicant failed to provide enough detail regarding the accrual of her\ndelinquencies given their nature and seriousness. Moreover, although she has made\nsome progress in satisfying them, it is minimal in light of the amount due, and their\nrecurrent nature. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-person\nconcept, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concern about her finances.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on April 24, 2007. On \nMarch 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 31, 2008; answered it on \nApril 17, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received \nthe request on April 21, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 29, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on May 8, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on May 12, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 29, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through P, which were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to keep the record open until June 13, 2008 to enable her to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. On June 5, 2008, Applicant requested additional time to submit \nevidence, and I extended the deadline until June 27, 2008. Her request and my ruling \nare attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. Applicant timely submitted AX Q \nthrough WW, and they were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s \nresponse to AX Q through WW is attached to the record as HX II. Applicant\u2019s reply to \nDepartment Counsel was marked as AX WW instead of a hearing exhibit because of its \ntestimonial nature. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX WW are attached as \nHX III. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2008. The record closed on July \n15, 2008.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 5, a personal subject interview extracted from a \nreport of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and she \nwaived it (Tr. 25-28). Accordingly, I admitted GX 5 without authentication. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations, but she \nexplained that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.r had been satisfied by \ngarnishment. Her admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old personnel clerk employed by a federal contractor. She \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from February 1978 until she accepted early \nretirement as a sergeant (pay grade E-5) in September 1994. She held a security \nclearance while in the Army. After she retired, she worked at a discount retail store and \nfour separate temporary jobs as a government contractor\u2019s employee (Tr. 47). She \nworked as a warehouse supervisor from April 1999 to August 2003, when she quit her \njob because of a disagreement about compensatory time. She was unemployed from \nAugust 2003 to May 2004 (Tr. 48-49). She has worked for her current employer since \nMay 2004. She does not have a current security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor considers her a trusted and valuable employee \n(GX 2 at 2). He describes her as a person with a \u201clarge heart\u201d who cares about the \npeople she serves (AX H). Her program manager considers her highly self-motivated, \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndedicated to team building, and \u201cwilling to go the extra mile\u201d to do her job (AX A). She \nreceived a letter of commendation in December 2006 and an award for excellence in \nDecember 2007 (AX B and C). At the hearing, she presented copies of numerous hand-\nwritten notes from military personnel, thanking her for her help, consideration, and \nattentiveness to their needs (AX D-G). \n \n \nApplicant is unmarried, but she has a 25-year-old daughter with three children. \nApplicant testifies she helps her daughter \u201cabundantly\u201d with financial support, because \nthe father of her children is financially irresponsible (Tr. 42). She also gives money to \nher older brother, who promises to repay her but never does (Tr. 42, 59-60). She \ntestified she purchased a townhouse in 1999, and accrued most of her debts between \n2001 and 2003. When Applicant quit her job in 2003, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.n already were delinquent (GX 3, GX 4). After the \nmortgage on her townhouse was foreclosed, she moved in with her boyfriend and \u201cjust \ngave up\u201d on meeting her financial obligations (Tr. 42, 50). \n \n \nBetween June 23 and June 25, 2008, Applicant resolved all the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. She borrowed money from her aunt to resolve the debts, and she is \nnow obligated to pay her aunt $1,000 per month until the debt is paid. She told her aunt \nshe needed to pay off her delinquent debts in order obtain a security clearance (AX XX). \nSeveral other delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR also were paid off at the same \ntime, including a delinquent debt of $5,121 to an instrumentality of the U.S. (AX W).  \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount Status \nEvidence \n1.a \nMedical \n$140 \nPaid, 6-23-08 \nAX R, Y \n1.b \nUtility bill \n$351 \nPaid, 6-23-08 \nAX Z, AA, BB, CC \n1.c \nCredit card \n$360 \nPaid, 6-23-08 \nAX S \n1.d \nCredit card \n$1,837 \nPartial payment, 6-24-08 \nAX DD \n1.e \nCredit card \n$2,851 \nCompromised and paid, 6-23-08 \nAX T, EE, FF \n1.f \nCredit card \n$2,996 \nPaid, 6-24-08 \nAX GG \n1.g \nUtility bill \n$351 \nSame as 1.b \nTr. 18 \n1.h \nCollection \n$1,003 \nPaid, 6-24-08 \nAX HH \n1.i \nMail order \n$232 \nPaid, 6-24-08 \nAX II \n1.j \nClothing \n$2,216 \nCompromised and paid, 6-24-08 \nAX JJ \n1.k \nCredit card \n$3,600 \nPartial payment, 6-25-08 \nAX VV \n1.l \nCredit card \n$6,193 \nSatisfied by garnishment \nAnswer; AX WW \n1.m \nBank loan \n$3,061 \nSatisfied \nAX V, AX KK \n1.n \nClothing \n$932 \nCompromised and paid, 6-24-08 \nAX LL, MM \n1.o \nCredit card \n$1,158 \nPartial payment, 6-24-08 \nAX NN \n1.p \nCredit card \n$760 \nSettled 6-24-08 \nTr. 65; AX P, JJ \n1.q \nMortgage \nForeclosure \n$85,578 Department Counsel conceded \nallegation is unfounded \nTr. 18 \n1.r \nJudgment \n$8,347 \nSame as 1.l  \nAnswer; AX WW \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in June 2007, Applicant attributed \nher financial problems to \u201cbad financial judgments\u201d and mismanagement of her money \n(GX 5 at 3). At the hearing, she testified her bad financial judgments included paying too \nmuch for a car that needed extensive repairs, and allowing her daughter to go on a \nbeach vacation in 2001 and run up a large credit card balance (Tr. 74-75). \n \n \nApplicant once consulted with a financial planner but dropped out of the program \nafter a couple of payments. She also considered bankruptcy, but decided to handle her \ndebts herself (Tr. 73-74). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current net pay is about $1,600 per month (Tr. 66). She receives \n$878 per month in military retired pay (Tr. 67). She has no car payment because she \nuses her boyfriend\u2019s car. Her boyfriend pays the mortgage but she contributes about \n$300 per month for groceries, $400 for household expenses, $200 for her \ngrandchildren, $220 for credit card payments, and $170 for her cell phone, leaving a \nmonthly remainder of about $1,118. \n \n \nApplicant recently inherited an interest in real property from her mother. At the \nhearing, she stated her intent to ask the executor of the estate to allow one of her \nsiblings to purchase her interest in the property as a means of raising funds to pay her \ndelinquent debts (Tr. 78). In her post-hearing submissions, she did not submit any \nfurther evidence regarding her interest in this property.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts totaling about $113,080. The evidence \nshows that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g are the same debt, and the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.r are the same debt. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at \n3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.l. in Applicant=s \nfavor.  \n \nDepartment counsel conceded that the $85,578 mortgage foreclosure debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.q could not be established by substantial evidence. Accordingly, I have \nresolved SOR \u00b6 1.q in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6 19(a), (b), (c), and (e). Her loans to her \nirresponsible older brother and allowing her daughter to incur a large credit card debt on \na beach vacation were \u201cirresponsible\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6 19(b). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise several \ndisqualifying conditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first two prongs of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not \nestablished, because Applicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts, several of \nwhich were not resolved until after the hearing. They did not arise because of unusual \ncircumstances that are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Her conduct in responding to financial \n\n \n7 \n \n \nproblems by \u201cjust giving up\u201d casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e. conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s loss of \nemployment in August 2003 was voluntary, and she already had numerous delinquent \ndebts when she quit her job. Her response, by \u201cjust giving up,\u201d was not responsible. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive. If \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control. Applicant sought and \nreceived financial counseling for a short period, but she terminated her participation \nafter making a couple payments. Applicant now has the debts alleged in the SOR under \ncontrol, but she did so by incurring a new debt to her aunt, on which the monthly \npayments will consume all of her net remainder, leaving nothing for unexpected \nexpenses. It is too soon to tell whether she has her finances under control. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant held a clearance while in the \nArmy, and she knew her delinquent debts would raise security concerns, but she did \nvirtually nothing until she received the SOR. None of the debts except the debt satisfied \nby garnishment were resolved until after the hearing. When she borrowed money from \nher aunt, she told her aunt she needed the money to pay off her delinquent debts so \nthat she could obtain a security clearance. The evidence shows her motivation for \nresolving the debts was not a sense of obligation, but rather a desire to obtain a \nclearance. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for 17 years, and held a clearance \nfor many years, apparently without incident. She is a kind and caring person, as \nevidenced by the numerous expressions of gratitude from those whom she has helped \nin her role as a personnel clerk. She has given money to her brother and daughter \nwithout regard for her own financial needs.  \n \n \nApplicant was candid and sincere at the hearing. Nevertheless, her financial \ntrack record leaves me with doubt whether she will exercise financial discipline once the \npressure of obtaining a clearance is removed. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.r \nwas resolved by garnishment, not any voluntary action by Applicant. She has neglected \nher delinquent debts for more than four years. She responded to the pressure of \nobtaining a clearance by borrowing money from her aunt, substituting a large new debt \nfor numerous delinquent debts. Doubts about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment will persist until she establishes a record of financial responsibility. \nPerhaps, in a year or so, she will establish such a record, if she timely repays the loan \nto her aunt and does not accumulate any more delinquent debts. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.37 through E3.1.39 (reconsideration authorized after one year). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude she has \nnot carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.p: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Integrated Systems Technician, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct. The Applicant has worked for his current employer for more than 20 years. He has held a security clearance since 1990, and has never committed a security violation. Prior to that, he served in the United States Marines for 8 years, held a security clearance during that time, and never violated security rules or regulations. The arrest described below was isolated, occurred under unusual circumstances and the chances of reoccurrence are nil. The Applicant\u2019s wife is suffering from a serious illness, known as graves disease. The condition requires that she not get overly excited or nervous which could bring on a heart attack. Applicant\u2019s wife is a very giving person, and it is her nature to help people who are less fortunate than she. From time to time, she gratuitously provided financial assistance to a woman and her two children who were on welfare.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nOctober 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions, on May 12, 2007.\nOn June 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 28, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. This Administrative Judge was assigned the\ncase on August 11, 2008.   A notice of hearing on September 12, 2008, scheduling the\nhearing on October 8, 2008. The Government offered five exhibits, referred to as\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant\noffered seven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G without objection,\nand testified on his own behalf.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on\nOctober 20, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until October\n22, 2008, to submit additional matters.  He submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit,\nconsisting of two pages.  The record closed on October 22, 2008.  Based upon a review\n\n2\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 54 years old and has about two years of college.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Integrated Systems Technician, and is applying\nfor a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant has worked for his current employer for more than 20 years.  He\nhas held a security clearance since 1990, and has never committed a security violation.\nPrior to that, he served in the United States Marines for 8 years, held a security\nclearance during that time, and never violated security rules or regulations.  The arrest\ndescribed below was isolated, occurred under unusual circumstances and the chances\nof reoccurrence are nil.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife is suffering from a serious illness, known as graves disease.\nThe condition requires that she not get overly excited or nervous which could bring on a\nheart attack.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a very giving person, and it is her nature to help people\nwho are less fortunate than she.  From time to time, she gratuitously provided financial\nassistance to a woman and her two children who were on welfare.  The situation got to\nthe point, where the woman was frequently requesting money from the Applicant\u2019s wife,\nand the Applicant felt his wife was being taken advantage of.  On one occasion, the\nwoman asked for money and the Applicant refused her.  That day, the Applicant had left\n$75.00 on the table.  When the woman left his house, the Applicant\u2019s money was gone.\nThe Applicant called the woman and she admitted to taking the money and said that\nshe would bring it right back.  She never did.  \nSeveral days later the woman telephoned, and sounded suicidal.  Concerned\nabout the woman\u2019s well being, the Applicant\u2019s wife went over to the woman\u2019s apartment.\nThe Applicant, being concerned about his wife\u2019s health condition and the drama that\ncould result from the situation,  went with his wife.  At the apartment, an altercation\nensued.  The woman began pulling the Applicant\u2019s wife by the head into her apartment\nwhile screaming that she was being robbed.  A lamp shade was broken during the\ncommotion.  The Applicant, in an effort to defend his wife pushed the woman back, and\nhe and his wife left.  Once at home, the Applicant called the police and explained the\nsituation.  On March 30, 2006, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1)\nAggravated Trespass, (2) Vandalism-Damage $400.00 or more, and (3) Battery.  On or\nabout September 2006, two additional charges were added: (4) Obstructing Telephone\nLine, and (5) Prevent or Dissuade Witness or Victim from giving Testimony.  The\nApplicant hired an attorney and was advised to take the plea bargain.  The Applicant\npleaded guilty to Counts (1) and (2) and the remaining charges were dismissed on or\nabout December 19, 2006.  The Applicant was sentenced to three years probation, to\npay approximately $200.00 in fines/assessments, to complete 160 hours of community\nservice, attend an anger management program, and was ordered to stay away from the\nvictim.  The Applicant has completed all of the sentencing requirements except his\n\n3\nprobationary period.  He is on unsupervised probation until December 2009.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C)\nFollowing the incident, the Applicant reported to work and immediately informed\nhis security department of the arrest.  The Applicant is extremely remorseful about the\nincident, and he and his wife no longer associate with the woman.\nFor the past thirty years, the Applicant has not been arrested, charged or\nconvicted of any offense.  Other than the incident in question, he indicated that he was\narrested for Drunk Driving some thirty years ago.\nTwo letters of recommendation from professional colleagues of the Applicant\nattest to the Applicant\u2019s strong technical ability to the aircraft, including testing,\ntroubleshooting and problem solving.  They maintain that he is a team player and a\ngreat asset to the organization.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit). \nApplicant has received several awards from his employer for excellent\nperformance on the job.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\nApplicant has been a regular blood donor for the Red Cross for many years.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n32.(a) So much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\n4\n32.(d) There is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline J of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant\u2019s arrest in March 2006, was an isolated\nincident that occurred over two years ago.  His only other encounter with law\nenforcement occurred over thirty years ago.  Although he was convicted of Aggravated\nTrespass and Vandalism, except for his probationary period, he has satisfied all of the\ncourts sentencing requirements.  Under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying\nconditions, 31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 32.(a) so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and 32.(d) there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement also apply. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant has worked for the same\ndefense contractor for over twenty years.  He has never received a security violation.\nHe is respected and admired by his colleagues.  He made a one time poor decision that\nhas caused him serious grief.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the\nconduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person\nassessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a willingness to\n\n6\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay properly safeguard classified information. \n \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

None of the debts have been paid.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDecember 11, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 16, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn August 8, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated September 16, 2008. The FORM contained 24 \nattachments. On September 25, 2008, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along \nwith notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions. Applicant\u2019s response was due on \nOctober 25, 2008, 30 days after his receipt of the FORM. As of December 5, 2008, no \nresponse had been received. On November 19, 2008, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nand SOR \u00b6 1.k of the SOR. He admitted the remaining allegations. \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old mechanic who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince January 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.

He lost \nhis job the end of 2005 and continued to live in the apartment without paying rent. When \nhe left, he owed $1,602 in past due rent. In August 2006, a $1,914 judgment was \nentered against Applicant in favor of the owners of the apartment. (SOR \u00b6 1.b, Items 10, \n12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) Applicant denies this judgment asserting he made a lump-sum \nsettlement on this judgment in September 2006. He provided no documents supporting \nthis assertion. \n \nDuring a December 2007 interview (Item 24), Applicant discussed his finances. \nHe admitted a number of the debts and stated he did not recognize six debts. At that \ntime, he stated he was attempting to re-establish his credit and was not aware of any \nnew delinquent accounts. He stated he would contact the delinquent accounts holders \nthe following month to establish a repayment plan. No evidence of any payment or \nrepayment plan is found in the record. \n \n\n \n \n \n3\n                                                          \nThe debts Applicant admitted he owed were: SOR \u00b6 1d ($7932) on which he \nclaimed he had been making payments since March 2006 and stated the debt should \nbe settled by December 2008; SOR \u00b6 1m ($572) for a computer; SOR \u00b6 1o ($363) for \nautomobile insurance; and, SOR \u00b6 1p ($85), a water bill. (Item 24) Applicant asserted, \nbut provided no documentation, that he made an $85 lump sum payment in February \n2006 to settle this debt with the water company. During the December 2007 interview, \nApplicant was unaware and could provide no information about the following debts: \nSOR \u00b6 1c ($4,489); SOR \u00b6 1e ($731), a telephone bill; SOR \u00b6 ($1,561); SOR \u00b6 1h \n($99); SOR \u00b6 1i ($95), a telephone bill; and SOR \u00b6 1l ($182). (Item 24) In his answer to \nthe interrogatories (Item 4) and in his SOR answer, Applicant admitted owing each of \nthese debts. The debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1c ($489) and SOR \u00b6 1d ($793) are the same \ndebt.  \n \nIn December 2002, a mortgage corporation filed suit against Applicant. (Item 23) \nApplicant\u2019s June 2008 credit report (Item 5) lists a $44,217 debt (SOR \u00b6 1k) as a \ncharged off real estate mortgage account. Applicant denied this debt.  \n \nThree additional judgments are contained in the record, but are not debts listed in \nthe SOR. In February 2008, a $304 judgment was entered against Applicant in favor of \na condo association. (Item 11) In December 2004, a $9,064 judgment was entered \nagainst Applicant in favor of an investment group. (Item 19) In October 1003, a $7,635 \njudgment was entered against Applicant in favor of a bank. (Item 20)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s June 2008 credit report (Item 5, page 2) list the balance owed at $5,541. \n\n \n \n \n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified \n\n \n \n \n5\ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nThe record evidence supports the conclusion that Applicant has a history of \nfinancial problems. Applicant admits owing approximately $49,588 on 13 past due \nobligations, including one tax lien. He owes $46,131 on an additional judgment and a \ncharged off mortgage, which he did not admit. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his \ninterview by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, his SOR \nresponse, and his response to interrogatories. Throughout this process, he admitted \nresponsibility for a number of his debts including the $33,888 tax lien. He denied owing \nonly two of the SOR debts. All of the SOR debts are currently delinquent. In December \n2007, he stated he would contact his delinquent creditors the following month and set \nup repayment plans with them. He provided no documentation to show he did so or that \nhe has made any progress resolving these debts. \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant presented no evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve his 15 debts or \nthat he participated in financial counseling. His financial problems are recent, are likely \n\n \n \n \n6\nto recur and cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and February 1999 \ndivorce are events beyond Applicant\u2019s control which would have contributed to his \nfinancial problems. AG & 20(b) has some applicability. However, the divorce took place \nnine years ago, which would diminish the impact of that event on his current debts. How \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment affected his financial problems is not part of the \nrecord. Applicant has been employed since June 2006, and five of the SOR debts are \neach less than $200. Even these smaller debts have not been paid. He presented no \nevidence of financial responsibility. \n \nUnder AG & 20(c), there is no showing Applicant has attended financial classes, \nmaintains a budget, or is paying his debts. AG & 20(c) does not apply. He asserts he is \nattempting to rebuild his credit and has no additional \u201cnew\u201d delinquent accounts. \n \nUnder AG & 20(d), Applicant asserted he settled two debts (SOR & 1.b and & \n1.p) and was making payments on another (SOR & 1.d), but failed to document any \nsettlement or payment. There is no evidence of good-faith efforts to repay the debts. AG \n& 20(d) does not apply. \n \nEven if there was sufficient documentation showing the two debts he denied \nwere no longer owing, the remaining unpaid obligations are sufficient to support an \nunfavorable finding.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant admits all but two of the \ndebts. In December 2007, he promised to contact his creditors to establish a repayment \nplan. There is no evidence he has done so, or that he has paid any of the debts. \nApplicant is 48 years old and sufficiently mature to properly handle his financial \nobligations, but has not done so.  \n \nThere is no record evidence as to Applicant\u2019s gross income, monthly expenses, \nor net remainder (discretionary income). There is no evidence he is in a position to \nrepay these debts or that he is now living within his means. There is no evidence of \nrehabilitation, permanent change of behavior, or the likelihood the debts will not \ncontinue. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c and 1.e- 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

He also argues that the Judge erred in his conclusion that he\nhad deliberately omitted information concerning his criminal record and drug use, contending that\nhe had misunderstood the questions at issue.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

A hearing was held on the scheduled date, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nFebruary 17, 2009\n\n2\nand two exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December 24, 2008.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified the security clearance\napplication (e-QIP) he completed in June 2007 by omitting his (a) past drug use and (b)\nhis drug-related arrests (eight in all) between 1989 and 2001. Under Guideline J, the\nfalsification and underlying arrest allegations made under Guideline E, were\nincorporated and re-alleged.\n For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his alleged arrests and criminal\ncharges but denied falsifying his security clearance application.  He claimed the charges\ncovered in subparagraphs 1.b(5) through (8) were dismissed or dropped.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old-frequency controller for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant has been employed by his current employer since May 2007 (ex. 1;\nR.T., at 24-25).  He is an Air Force (AF) veteran and considers himself to be very\npatriotic (R.T., at 26).  He divorced his first wife in 1996 and remarried two years ago,\nafter dating his current spouse for four to five years (R.T., at 37, 74).  He has 15-year-\nold son who lives with him and his current wife (R.T., at 28).\nApplicant was introduced to methamphetamine in the late 1980s (believed to be\n1989).  He was depressed at the time over losing his job and having no place to live\n(R.T., at 29-30).  He experimented with the drug with friends and family members in\nsocial settings (R.T., at 30).  He estimates to have used methamphetamine monthly for\nabout five years (R.T., at 30), before increasing his use frequency of the drug in the\nmid-1990s to twice a week (R.T., at 31).  During this time period, he was living with\npeople who used it and made it more readily available to him for his personal use. \nBetween 1989 and 2001, Applicant was involved in eight separate drug-related\narrests.  In 1989, he was arrested for methamphetamine possession after police found\nmeth in his car and tested him positive for the drug. Applicant pleaded no contest to\npossession charges, and the court sentenced him to three years of probation  (see exs.\n2 and 3).  Records show that he was arrested again in 1991 and charged with\npossession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), possession of drug\nparaphernalia, and being under the influence of a controlled substance. The court found\nApplicant guilty of these charges and sentenced him to 90 days in jail.  The court also\nextended his probation stemming from his 1989 charges for an additional three years\n\n3\nand ordered him to attend weekly drug-related counseling (see ex. 2).  Applicant\nrecalled attending weekly drug-awareness group sessions, but he did not complete the\nprogram (ex. 2).\nRecords confirm that Applicant was charged with (a) possession of concentrated\ncannabis and violation of probation in 1993, for which he was fined, (b) possession  of a\ncontrolled substance (methamphetamine), use/under the influence of a controlled\nsubstance, and possession of controlled substance paraphernalia in 1995, for which he\npleaded no contest to the two possession charges and received extended probation to\nMarch 1998, \u00a9) being under the influence of a controlled substance in 1999, which was\ndismissed, (d) under the influence of a controlled substance in November 2000, which\nwas dismissed, and (e) controlled substance paraphernalia possession, being under the\ninfluence of a controlled substance, and possession of a controlled substance in May\n2001 (see exs. 2 and 3).  These 2001 charges were dropped after Applicant supplied\nthe names of known drug dealers to the police (see ex. 2; R.T., at 50-51).\nApplicant was treated for drug abuse in 1999 in accordance with his court-\nordered treatment conditions (R.T., at 31-32).  His treatment regimen consisted of a\nthree-month inpatient and aftercare program that stressed the 12-step program of Drugs\nAnonymous (DA).  He used methamphetamine just a few times after completing his\ndrug rehabilitation program.\nFaced with pressures from his wife and family to give up drugs, and concerned\nabout his future, Applicant quit using illegal drugs altogether in 2002 (see ex. 2; R.T., at\n34-36, 60).  He no longer associates with people who use illegal substances.  Although\nApplicant initially questioned the accuracy of the 1996-2002 time frame he used\nmethamphetamine for recreational purposes, he acknowledged the possibilities of his\nusing methamphetamine during this time frame when pressed by Department Counsel.\nThe record is lacking in any Applicant request to the agent to correct the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) summary of interview he was shown  (see ex. 2; R.T., at\n35-37).   \n \nApplicant was asked to complete an e-QIP in early June 2007.  Question 23 of\nhis questionnaire asked him about drug-related arrests (no time limits specified). When\nanswering subparagraph 32d, he checked \u201cno.\u201d  He checked \u201cno,\u201d too, when answering\nquestion 24, which inquired about his use of illegal substances within the previous\nseven years. Applicant attributes his question 23 omissions to confusion and\ninadvertent mistakes over the date of his last use of methamphetamine (R.T., at 52-54).\nEven though he was afforded permission to take the e-QIP home with him to complete,\nhe answered the questions in haste without double-checking with his wife for her\nrecollection of his last use of the drug (R.T., at 52-54).  \nWhen answering question 24 of his e-QIP, Applicant explains that he misread the\nquestion to include a similar seven-year limitation governing the scope of the question\n(R.T., at 25-26, 52-57). He further explains that he could not remember the date of his\nlast drug-related arrest (in 2001), and thought over seven years had elapsed since his\n\n4\nlast arrest involving illegal drugs (R.T., at 56).  He made no notes about the possible\ndates of his last arrest in the comments section of the e-QIP, and made no voluntary\nfollow-up efforts to alert DoD of possible drug-related arrests within the seven-year time\nframe he cited in hi se-QIP.   Applicant did express remorse for the inconvenience his\nomissions have caused, and assured he has put his past behavior behind him (see ex.\nB).  \nConsidering all of the circumstances surrounding the inclusive periods of his use\nof methamphetamine, his drug-related arrests and charges associated with them\n(dismissals in four of the eight reported cases), and his claimed misunderstandings\nabout the scope of the respective questions, his explanations cannot be reconciled with\nthe time-line of events that culminated with his guilty plea to the 2001 amended\ncharges.  Miscalculating a drug cut-off date, or misreading a question might be plausible\nif considered separately on a piece-meal basis.  When his omissions are considered\ntogether, though, they tend more to reflect an omission pattern that is indicative of a\nconcerted  desire on Applicant\u2019s part to suppress his extensive drug involvement from\nDoD investigators.  Inferences cannot be averted here that his omissions were knowing\nand intentional under all the circumstances manifest at the time, and calculated to\nconceal his recurrent use of illegal substances and drug-related arrests. \nNot until confronted in an October 2007 interview by an OPM investigator about\nhis arrest record covering his eight drug-related arrests/charges did Applicant disclose\nhis arrest record and disposition of the same (see exs. 2 and 3; R.T., at 66-67).  After\nshowing Applicant his arrest record and eliciting admissions from Applicant about these\narrests, the OPM investigator asked Applicant whether he ever used illegal drugs (R.T.,\nat 66-67).  He responded affirmatively to her questions.  After completing his statement,\nthe OPM investigator gave him a copy of her prepared statement for him to review.\nApplicant made no changes to the statement and indicated the prepared statement\naccurately reflected his answers (see ex. 2; R.T., at 66).  \n Applicant\u2019s spouse assures she has always loved him, beginning when they\ndated in high school (R.T., at 71, 73).  Still, she gave him an ultimatum after they got\nback together in the 2002 time frame to clean up his finances and cease using drugs\n(R.T., at 38, 74-76).  She credits him with changing his life for the better (R.T., at 74).\nShe is certain he would never jeopardize the Government\u2019s national security interests.\nHer impressions are sincere and are accepted. \nApplicant is well regarded by friends and coworkers who know him.  They\ndescribe him as a responsible team paper who helps his colleagues in resolving\nmission-related issues (see ex. A).  His pastor describes him as an active member of\nhis church\u2019s faith community and one who enjoys a very good reputation in the\ncommunity for trustworthiness. His facility clearance officer (FSO) finds nothing\ndisqualifying in Applicant\u2019s personnel security folder.  And Applicant\u2019s mother credits\nhim with making a good life for his son and wife of two years (see ex. A).  She places\nconsiderable emphasis on Applicant\u2019s developed spiritual faith and the life he has made\nfor his son and wife.\n\n5\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Adjudication Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 15.\n               \nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 30.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\n\n6\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a good frequency controller and devoted father and husband who\nused illegal substances (methamphetamine) on a recurrent basis over a 13-year period\n(1989 through 2002), and was arrested/charged on eight separate occasions during this\ntime for drug-related offenses.  When asked about his arrests and drug-related activities\nin a June 2007 e-QIP, he answered in the negative.  Applicant did not disclose his past\ndrug use and arrests until confronted about his arrests by an OPM investigator four\nmonths later in a follow-up interview (viz., in October 2007).  Security concerns are\nraised over his omissions of his drug use and drug-related arrests. \nFalsification issues\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s multiple omissions of his drug use and drug-related arrests/charges in the\nsecurity clearance application he completed in June 2007, and in his withholding of his\narrest/charges until he was confronted in an ensuing OPM interview.  So much trust is\nimposed on persons cleared to see classified information that deviation tolerances for\ncandor lapses are gauged very narrowly. \nApplicant makes clear that he approached questions 23 and 24 of his e-QIP with\nthe intent to withhold as much  information about his past use of illegal substances and\ndrug-related arrest history as he believed he could safely rationalize.  His omissions\nwere knowing, deliberate, and material to a determination about his clearance suitability.\nThey invite application of AG \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, falsification or\nmisrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, since he failed to promptly correct his\ndetermined intentional e-QIP omissions and follow-up OPM interview before being\nconfronted by the OPM investigator about his drug-related arrest history.  In the past, the\n\n7\nAppeal Board has denied applicants availability of the predecessor mitigating condition\nof MC \u00b6 27(a),  \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d where the applicant\nhas waited many months to timely correct a known omission. Compare ISCR Case No.\n97-0289 (App. Bd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (App. Bd. January\n1995).  Even if Applicant\u2019s corrections can be considered prompt (i.e., within four months\nof his e-QIP omissions), his drug-related arrest acknowledgments were made only after\nhe was confronted with his arrest records by the interviewing OPM investigation, and\nperforce do not qualify as \u201cgood faith\u201d corrections under current AG mitigating condition,\nMC \u00b6 17(a).\nBy intentionally failing to disclose his prior drug use and drug-related arrests\ncharges in his e-QIP Applicant concealed materially important background information\nneeded for the government to properly process and evaluate his security updates.  His\nattributed reasons for his omitting his drug use and arrest/charges (mistaken last use\nand reading in a seven-year qualifier in the question covering his drug-related arrests)\nare not sustainable grounds for averting inferences of falsification. \n Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his multiple e-QIP drug use and\narrest/charge omissions and lack of any prompt, good faith corrections, Applicant\u2019s\nclaims lack the necessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions that he\nknowingly and deliberately withheld material background information about his prior drug\nuse and arrest/charges.  Questions 23 and 24 are straightforward and contain no\nambiguous instructions that could reasonably be expected to trip up an applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations considered together, and not in piecemeal, do not convincingly\ndemonstrate plausible confusion and mistake on his part when he responded to the\npertinent questions in his e-QIP.\nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2(a) factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b of Guideline E. \nCriminal implications of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nApplicant\u2019s slate of multiple drug-related arrests over 13-year period and e-QIP\nomissions are potentially criminal in nature.  Making a materially false statement under\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious felony and is punishable by fine and incarceration. To be\nmaterial, a falsification must have a \u201ca natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of\ninfluencing, the decision-making body to which it is addressed.\u201d  See United States v.\nGaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995).  Applicant\u2019s omitted drug-related arrests (eight in all),\nwhile reduced some in their overall seriousness by the dismissal or dropping of his last\nfour arrests (covered by subparagraphs 1.b(5) through 1.b(8), retain their overall material\nsignificance to a security clearance eligibility assessment and merited  inclusion in\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP.  \n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s convictions that resulted from Applicant\u2019s previous arrests (1989\nthrough 1995), his arrests/charges that were dismissed or dropped, and his e-QIP\nomissions retain enough serious trust implications to warrant consideration of  two\ndisqualifying conditions of AG \u00b6 31.  DC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses,\u201d and DC \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless\nof whether the person was formally charged,\u201d have application to his many drug-related\narrests over a 12-year period and his most recent e-QIP omissions.  \nTo be sure, mitigation of the criminal features of his omissions falls along a little\nbit different fault line than is the case with personal conduct considerations.  Here,\nApplicant\u2019s positive work record, impressions of his pastor, and his demonstrated family\ncommitments play some role in mitigating criminal conduct coverage of his omissions.\nMC \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training\nor higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d\nhas application. Employment of this guideline and the use of separate whole-person\nweighing of Applicant\u2019s actions have only limited application to Applicant\u2019s lengthy\npattern of drug-related arrests and imputed intentional omissions. \nWith the aid of the lessons he has learned since his marriage to his current wife\nand the responsibility he has shown in the care for his young son, Applicant has\ndemonstrated important improvements in his maturity and responsibility levels.\nEmployment of MC \u00b6 32(d) might weigh heavily in applicant\u2019s favor were it not for his\ndetermined intentional e-QIP omissions.  \nHowever, there is more to be considered in determining whether the criminal\nconduct concerns can be mitigated than his omissions.  Weighing the benefits of his\nshown professional achievements and his family/community support in juxtaposition to\nhis collective arrests and omission history do not satisfy the rehabilitation requirements\nof either MC \u00b6 32(d) or an overall whole person assessment. Put another way, the\nconsidered application of the AG mitigating conditions for criminal conduct and a\nseparate whole person analysis do not absolve or mitigate security concerns associated\nwith Applicant\u2019s drug-related arrests and more recent omissions.  \nTaking into account all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2(a), unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b of Guideline J. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n\n9\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):         AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a and 1:b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a and 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

(Government Exhibit 4).  On September 8, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G and E for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel; Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 9, 2009, in which he\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on January 4, 2010.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on January 12, 2010, and he submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\n\n2\nundersigned for resolution on March 11, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file\nand exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 46 years old and has completed two years of college.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Graphic Artist, and has worked for the same\ncompany for over twenty years.  He is applying for a security clearance in connection\nwith his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  His\nlong history of alcohol abuse spans almost twenty years.  He has consumed alcohol at\ntimes to excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1991 to at least\nDecember 2008.  As a result of excessive drinking, he has been arrested and convicted\non three separate occasions for drunk driving.  He has undergone a series of alcohol\ntreatment programs, including two inpatient treatment programs, and outpatient\ntreatment about thirty times.  His excessive drinking has cost him his marriage, reflected\nby a divorce in October 2006, and has negatively effected his job performance, reflected\nby a low performance appraisal.  Despite these repercussions, the Applicant continues\nto drink.  (Government Exhibit 5.)   \nHis first arrest occurred in March 1991, wherein he was charged with (1) Under\nthe Influence Alcohol/Drug in Vehicle and (2) .08% More Weight Alcohol Drive Vehicle.\nHe pled guilty to Count (2), Count (1) was dismissed and he was sentenced to jail,\nfined, awarded probation and ordered to participate in treatment or counseling as\ndirected.  Applicant satisfied the court requirements, but continued to consume alcohol.\nApplicant received alcohol rehabilitation treatment from December 2004 to April\n2005.  Following the treatment, he continued to consume alcohol.\nSometime in 2005, the Applicant discussed his drinking problem with a counselor\nfrom his Employer\u2019s Assistance Program who referred him to the an alcohol\nrehabilitation center.  Applicant entered the program and received inpatient alcohol\nrehabilitation treatment from August 2005 to September 2005.  During this treatment, he\nwas diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence; Depressive Disorder and Nicotine\nDependence.  Following this treatment, he continued to consume alcohol.  Admission\nrecords from the medical center indicate that the Applicant had been drinking 1 to 1\u00bd\npints of alcohol per day, off and on, for a number of years.  He occasionally experiences\n\n3\nblack outs, but denies seizures.  He has had 90 days of sobriety in Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA) this year, and he has a sponsor.  He has been to over 200 AA\nmeetings in total, but has not done the fourth or fifth step of the AA program yet.\n(Government Exhibit 8.)    \nWhile still receiving treatment, the Applicant relapsed and was arrested and\ncharged in December 2005, with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs\nand (2) Driving Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs .08% or More Alcohol.  Applicant\nhad been drinking at home, got into his car and started driving, when the police pulled\nhim over for squealing his tires or rapid acceleration.  He pled guilty, imposition of\nsentence was suspended, and he was fined and order to attend a Level I Alcohol\nProgram.  (Government Exhibit 5).  \nThe Applicant was arrested a third time in August 2006, and charged with (1)\nDriving Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs, (2) Driving Under Influence of Alcohol or\nDrugs .08% or More Alcohol and (3) Driving When Privilege Suspended or Revoked for\nDriving Under the Influence.  Applicant had gone to a bar after work and had six or\nseven vodka tonics.  While driving home alone, he hit another car.  Applicant registered\na .26% blood alcohol level.  Applicant pled guilty and was sentenced to 60 days house\narrest, fined $2,500.00, his driver\u2019s license was suspended, he was placed on probation\nfor ten years, and required to attend and complete an eighteen month Multiple Offender\nAlcohol Program.  (Government Exhibit 5.)    \nFrom September 2006 to October 2006, the Applicant received inpatient alcohol\nrehabilitation treatment, for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Dependency, Depression,\nNOS.  The medical intake records reflect that prior to his admission, the Applicant\nconsumed vodka on a daily basis, and experienced two withdrawal seizures in March\n2006, and July 2006.  (Government Exhibit 7.)\nIn January 2007, the Applicant was charged with Failure to Appear for an ignition\ninterlock hearing and a bench warrant was issued and his probation was revoked.  In\nMarch 2007, a bench warrant was issued when he failed to appear to serve his jail\nsentence.  The warrant was recalled and his probation was reinstated when the court\nlearned that he was serving his sentence through electronic monitoring.\nThe Applicant indicated that although he has reported to work late, and the\nquality of his work has suffered from his excessive drinking, he has never reported to\nwork under the influence of alcohol.  On October 12, 2007, the Applicant stated that he\nhad stopped drinking and had been sober for 120 days.  (Government Exhibit5).    \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because his conduct involves questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations that raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. \n\n4\nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  In\nSeptember 2006, while in treatment for alcohol abuse, the Applicant tested positive for\ncannabinoids.  (Government Exhibit 7).  At that time, and since 2001, the Applicant has\nheld a DoD security clearance.  Applicant\u2019s medical records containing results of his\nhistory and physical examination dated September 12, 2006, indicate that Applicant\nused marijuana three times a month.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  The Applicant indicates\nthat he has never received a written reprimand or any other disciplinary action from his\nemployer for his conduct.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent;\n22(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; \n22(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of\nan alcohol rehabilitation program.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n5\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16(e)  personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding . . . . \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne. The extent to which the participation is voluntary;\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng. The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress;\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\n\n6\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse and personal conduct that demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G), and poor personal conduct\n(Guideline \nE). \n \nThis \nevidence \nindicates \npoor \njudgment, \nunreliability \nand\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the\nApplicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security\nclearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines G and E of the SOR.\n\n7\nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse over a period of almost twenty years\nincludes three arrests and convictions for Driving Under the Influence.  Although his\nmost recent arrest occurred in 2006, about four years ago, he continues to consume\nalcohol, which has been the at the root of his problems.  As a result of his most recent\narrest, the Applicant was ordered to participate in and complete a Multiple Offender\nAlcohol Program and was placed on ten years probation.  He remains on probation\ntoday.  His formal diagnosis of alcoholism, numerous inpatient, outpatient and aftercare\nprograms, followed by even more AA meetings, have not enabled him to maintain\nsobriety.  The Applicant\u2019s past history of alcohol abuse clearly demonstrates that there\nhas been and still is a serious alcohol problem.  \nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a), alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 22(c)\nhabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 22(d)\ndiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist,\nor psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; and, 22(f) relapse after\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance demonstrates\npoor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness.  Under Guideline E, Personal\nConduct, Disqualifying Conditions 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . applies.  None of the\nmitigating conditions apply.\nDespite the severe repercussions of the Applicant\u2019s abusive drinking pattern, he\ncontinues to consume alcohol.  Based upon his past, it is clear that he will more than\nlikely drink to excess in the future and endanger the public with his drunk driving and/or\nsubject the DoD to his careless and reckless ways.  Based upon his long history of\nalcohol abuse and poor personal conduct and its related negative effects on the\nApplicant, I am unable to find him sufficiently trustworthy to safeguard classified\ninformation.  Accordingly Guidelines G and E are found against the Applicant. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is a 46 years old alcoholic\nwith a very serious drinking problem, and no significant period of abstinence.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth above when viewed\nunder all of the guidelines as a whole, support a whole-person assessment of poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.  \n\n8\nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however, it does not come close\nto mitigating the negative effects of his excessive alcohol abuse, and poor personal\nconduct, and the effects that it can have on his ability to safeguard classified\ninformation.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn January 14, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines E and J, Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 25, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2009. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on June 9, 2009, scheduling the hearing for July 9, 2009. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \nSeptember 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n5. GE 1, 2, and 4 were admitted without objection. GE 3 and 5 were admitted over \nApplicant\u2019s objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) \nA through E, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on July 16, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She served in the \nU.S. Air Force from 1991 to 1999, and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (E-\n5). She has an associate\u2019s degree and some additional college credits. She is married \nbut separated, and has a 16-year-old child.1  \n \n \nThe security concerns in this case are based on an arrest and a series of \nlandlord-tenant issues. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on May 9, 2007, and charged with harboring a felon. The \ncharge was dismissed in March 2008. The police report detailed the incident. A police \nofficer (officer-1) was driving an unmarked car at about 8:15 in the morning on May 9, \n2007. He recognized a man (fugitive) driving a car (car-A), and thought the man had an \noutstanding felony warrant. He asked another officer (officer-2) to check if the man had \na warrant. Officer-2 confirmed that the man had an outstanding felony warrant for \nreceiving and transferring a stolen vehicle. Officer-1 saw the man drive into an \napartment complex. When he arrived in the parking lot of the complex, he saw car-A \nparked, but the man was not in the car. They set up surveillance on the car.2 \n \n \nAt about 10:00 that same morning, officer-2 saw Applicant walk in front of car-A \nand look around the area. Applicant went into the apartment complex and returned a \nshort time later. She got into another vehicle (car-B), which was parked near car-A, and \ndrove slowly around the parking lot. As she was driving, she looked at the undercover \nand uniformed officers in the parking lot. She then returned and parked next to car-A. \nApplicant got out of the car and entered the apartment building. She came out of the \nbuilding a short time later and drove off in car-B.3 \n \n \nApplicant returned to the apartment complex in car-B at about 10:30 a.m. A man, \nlater identified as the fugitive\u2019s brother (brother), was with her. The brother opened car-\nA and placed a backpack in the car. Applicant and the brother then went into the \napartment building.4 \n \n \nAt about 10:45 a.m., the brother left the apartment building and started to leave \nthe parking lot in car-A. Two officers (officers-3 and 4) stopped the car. Officer-3 asked \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 24-25, 44-45; GE 1. \n \n2 GE 3. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Id. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nthe brother if the fugitive was driving car-A earlier in the day. The brother stated that the \nfugitive was not with him and he was not at the apartment complex. Officer-3 asked \nofficer-1 to come to the scene to see if the brother was who officer-1 originally saw that \nmorning driving car-A. Officer-1 had arrested the fugitive in the past and confirmed that \nit was the fugitive, and not the brother, that he observed driving car-A that morning. The \nbrother originally stated that he had not seen the fugitive in several days. He eventually \nadmitted that the fugitive was driving car-A that morning. He stated that Applicant came \nto the motel where he was staying and told him that undercover police were outside the \napartment, and he needed to come and get car-A because the fugitive was hiding in her \napartment. He showed the officers the apartment where the fugitive was hiding. It was \nApplicant\u2019s apartment. He told the officers that Applicant and her husband were also in \nthe apartment, and they knew that the police were there. He stated they knew that the \nfugitive had a felony warrant for his arrest. He told the police that he attempted to lure \nthem away from the scene, in order to allow the fugitive to escape. They hoped that if \nthe police stopped him, the police might think it was the brother who was driving car-A \nthat morning.5 \n \n \nThe police went to Applicant\u2019s apartment. They knocked repeatedly on the door, \nrang the doorbell, and announced who they were, but nobody answered. They made \nnumerous announcements from outside the apartment with a loudspeaker. The police \nspecial weapons and tactics (SWAT) team was called in, and they also made \nannouncements over their loudspeaker. The fugitive eventually called the police on the \ntelephone and told them he was coming out. The police were at the apartment for \nseveral hours before the fugitive came out of the apartment. After he was apprehended, \nhe told the police that Applicant and her husband were inside the apartment. The SWAT \nteam continued to make announcements over the loudspeaker, and Applicant came out \na short time later. She was arrested. Her husband did not come out of the apartment. \nApplicant told the police that there was nobody left in the apartment. The police \ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s husband had a felony warrant from another state for failing \nto pay child support. The state was contacted and the police were told that the state \nwould not extradite Applicant\u2019s husband if he was arrested. They decided not to do \nanything further about Applicant\u2019s husband and they left the scene.6 \n \n \nOfficer-1 asked the fugitive if he recognized the officer when they passed each \nother that morning. He stated that he did recognize the officer, and he knew he had a \nwarrant for his arrest. The fugitive asked the officer why they did not go into the \napartment and arrest Applicant\u2019s husband. The officer told the fugitive it was because \nthe other state would not extradite Applicant\u2019s husband. The fugitive stated that he \nwould have come out of the apartment but Applicant\u2019s husband told him not to leave.7 \n \n                                                          \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. \n \n7 Id. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant provided a very different version of events. She gave her side of the \nstory to her facility security officer (FSO), who reported it to the Defense Security \nService (DSS) in an incident report dated May 18, 2007. She also described the incident \nto an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on June 20, 2007; \nin her response to the SOR; and at her hearing. She has consistently denied knowing \nthat the fugitive had a warrant, any intent to harbor him, and any involvement in a plan \nfor him to elude capture. She was inconsistent in other aspects of the incident.  \n \n \nApplicant told her FSO that the fugitive, who she only knew casually as a friend \nof a neighbor, came to her apartment to borrow her phone to call his mother to come \npick him up. He asked if he could stay at her apartment until his mother arrived. He said \nhe had his brother\u2019s car but it hurt too much to drive the standard transmission because \nhe had a broken pelvis. He offered her $5 in gas money if she would pick up his brother \nfrom a nearby location and bring him to the car, which she did. She then took a shower. \nShe did not hear the police come to the door because she was in the shower. After the \nshower, she heard the police over the loudspeaker and went to open the door, but the \nfugitive blocked her way. She finally convinced him to call the police, and he left the \napartment. She followed the advice of the police negotiator, and left shortly thereafter.8  \n \n \nApplicant told the OPM investigator a similar story in her June 2007 interview, \nexcept she stated that the fugitive\u2019s mother was going to pick Applicant up at the \nbrother\u2019s motel after Applicant dropped the car off. Applicant also stated that she took \nher shower and the police arrived before she went to pick up the brother. The OPM \ninterview was memorialized in a report of investigation (ROI). DOHA sent Applicant a \ncopy of the ROI in an interrogatory and asked her if the ROI accurately reflected the \ninformation she provided to the investigator on the day she was interviewed. She was \nprovided the opportunity to explain why the ROI was inaccurate and to add additional \ninformation regarding the matters discussed during the interview. She answered that the \nROI was accurate and submitted additional information unrelated to the factual details \nof her arrest.9 \n \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant stated: \n \nThe individual I was accused of harboring was a casual acquaintance with \na broken pelvis looking for a ride to the [county] court-house. I did not ask \nhim why he was going to court and he did not tell me he was being chased \nby police at the time he asked for the favor. I was only interested in the \ngas money he was going to pay me as compensation for the ride. \n \n \nApplicant testified essentially similar to her prior statements with some \nexceptions. She stated that the fugitive offered her gas money to drive him to the \ncourthouse. She also stated that he was waiting on a phone call back from his mother, \nwho might have been able to drive him to court. She stated that she went to the motel in \n                                                          \n8 GE 4. \n \n9 GE 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nthe fugitive\u2019s car, car-A, and gave it to the brother, who drove her back to her apartment \nin car-A. She stated the brother never went into her apartment; he just dropped her off \nand left. This contradicts the police report that indicated that she and the brother were in \nher car, car-B, and the brother went into the apartment. She testified that her husband \nwas not in the apartment and that the fugitive was alone in her apartment when she \nwent to give the car to the brother.10 \n \n \nI did not find Applicant to be a credible witness. To the extent that Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and prior statements varied from the account of events in the police report, I \nfind the facts to be as detailed in the police report. I further find that Applicant provided \nintentionally false or misleading information to her FSO, to the OPM investigator, in her \nresponse to the SOR, and at her hearing.11 \n \n \nThe remainder of the allegations against Applicant relate to disputes between \nApplicant and several landlords, and judgments obtained against her. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant terminated a lease with a realtor in 2005, and a \njudgment was entered against her in the approximate amount of $625, which she has \nsatisfied. Applicant admitted that a judgment was entered against her, but denied that \nshe had a lease with the property management company. She had what she felt was a \ndefense to the lawsuit, but she lost the case.  She paid the judgment in about 2005.12 \n \n \nApplicant terminated a lease with another apartment landlord in 2006. A \njudgment of $1,261 was obtained against her. This was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant \nstated that a maintenance worker at the apartment complex illegally entered her \napartment complex and stole some items and more than $900 in cash. She reported it \nto the landlord, but the landlord refused to do anything about it. She felt her only \nrecourse was to move out. She owed about $400 in back rent when she moved, but she \nfelt justified in not paying it because of the money that was stolen from her by the \nlandlord\u2019s employee. The judgment has not been satisfied.13 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s lease for her next apartment expired in about June 2007. Her landlord \nchose not to renew the lease, presumably because of the events with the police on May \n9, 2007, as described above. The landlord issued an eviction notice in June 2007, \nnotifying Applicant that she had to vacate the apartment. These events were alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.14 \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 25-34, 47-53. \n \n11 It was not alleged in the SOR that Applicant provided false information to the FSO or falsified \nthe OPM interview. Applicant\u2019s statements will not be used for disqualification purposes. They will be \nconsidered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility; in the application of mitigating conditions; and in \nevaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n12 Tr. at 35, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n13 Tr. at 35-37, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 5. \n \n14 Tr. at 37-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant had a dispute with the landlord of the next apartment where she lived. \nThe landlord obtained a judgment of $1,024 against her in June 2008. This was alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e. In her response to the SOR, Applicant stated that the judgment resulted \nfrom a miscommunication between the landlord and the landlord\u2019s son, who acted as \nthe property manager. She stated that she \u201csatisfied the judgment in June 2008.\u201d She \nadmitted at the hearing that the judgment was not satisfied. She testified that this \napartment was also burglarized. She stated that her documentation for her court case \nwas stolen. She suspected the landlord as the thief. She also indicated that the landlord \naltered the summons so that she appeared in court the day after the hearing. She \nadmitted that she did not phrase her response to the SOR very well, but she paid what \nshe felt was justified. She never collected her security deposit, so she felt they were \neven.15 \n \n \nApplicant stated that she and her current landlord have had no problems. She \nsubmitted five letters attesting to her outstanding job performance. She is described as \nindustrious, thorough, well-informed, intuitive, conscientious, responsible, trustworthy, \nhard-working, and reliable. She is recommended for a security clearance.16  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct of harboring a felon, as established by the police report, her \narrest, and her charges, is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant was involved in harboring a felon in May 2007. The charges were \neventually dismissed. Applicant has consistently denied her guilt. She indicated that she \nwas unaware that the fugitive was wanted by the police. However, her statements are \nimplausible and inconsistent. She gave false and misleading information to her FSO, to \nthe OPM investigator, and in her response to the SOR; and she knowingly provided \nfalse testimony at her hearing. That does not show successful rehabilitation. No \nmitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following mitigating condition is potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nIt is expected behavior in this society that one will pay his or her just debts. \nApplicant did not pay two judgments awarded against her. Her conduct as it relates to \nher unpaid judgments is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 16(e) as a disqualifying condition. The \npaid judgment and the eviction notice do not raise any disqualifying conditions. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.d are concluded for Applicant. \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 2007 criminal activity was alleged under both Guideline J and \nGuideline E. It is conduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. It establishes AG \u00b6 16(e) as a disqualifying condition.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant was dishonest about her criminal conduct on four occasions. No \nmitigating conditions are applicable to her actions on May 9, 2007, under the same \nrationale discussed above under the Criminal Conduct guideline. \n \n \nApplicant provided explanations for why she did not pay the two judgments. \nHowever, they are lawful judgments issued by a court. She did not indicate any intent to \npay the judgments. The total owed on the judgments does not amount to a large figure. \nBy themselves, the unpaid judgments do not create a security concern. However, when \nconsidered with all other evidence, they indicate questionable reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. No mitigating conditions are applicable to that conduct. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n10 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s service in the Air Force, and her very favorable character \nevidence. I considered the events of May 2007. Applicant\u2019s version of events has been \ninconsistent and is simply incredible. Without complete candor, it is impossible to find \nthat Applicant is rehabilitated, and that such events are unlikely to recur. Serious doubts \nremain about Applicant\u2019s judgment, honesty, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 30, \n2007. On August 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 6, 2008, and requested his \ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nOn November 17, 2008, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written \ncase.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the \n \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant. He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file.  Applicant filed a \nresponse to the FORM on December 12, 2008, within the 30 day time allowed that \nwould have expired on December 17, 2008. I received the case assignment on January \n22, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 6, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in && 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.j, and 1.k of the SOR, with explanations.  He \ndenied the allegations in \u00b6 \u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. \n \nApplicant is 57 years old, divorced, and works for a defense contractor. (Item 5) \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts totaling $12,500 in 11 debts.  He claims he does \nnot have sufficient income to repay these debts, except his education loan which he is \nrequired to repay.   He also claims he cannot consolidate his debts and repay them \nbecause the agencies he consulted tell him his monthly income is too low to qualify for a \ndebt consolidation loan.  (Items 3, 4, 6-10, FORM Response) \n \nApplicant\u2019s first debt listed in the SOR is for $6,638 owed on his 2003 Federal \nincome taxes.  This debt is unpaid. (Items 3, 4, 6-10) \n \nApplicant owes $160 on a credit card.  It is unpaid. (Items 4, 6-10) \n \nApplicant owes $511 to a creditor.  It is unpaid. (Items 4, 6-10) \n \nApplicant owes $2,314 for a television he purchased for $1,600.  This debt is also \nunpaid. (Items 3, 4, 6-10) \n \nApplicant denied he owed a telephone bill for $851.  He claims it is owed by \nsomeone else, but did not submit any proof of this debt being owed by another person.  \nThe debt remains unpaid. (Items 3, 4, 6-10) \n \nApplicant is paying $150 a month on his education loan of $13,487.  (Items 3, 4, \n6-10, FORM Response) \n \nApplicant admitted he owed $110 on a cable television video account.  He has \nnot repaid this debt since 2004. (Items 4, 6-10) \n \nApplicant denied he owes the debts listed in SOR Subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i for \nwhat he labels prepaid credit cards in the amount of $410 and $656.  He claims he \npurchased only one card for $75, and these debts are duplicates of each other.  Neither \ndebt has been repaid.  (Items 3, 4, 6-10) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant went to a hospital emergency room.  He thought the bill would be $350, \nbut instead it was $2,926, as set forth in SOR Subparagraph1.j.  He has not paid this \ndebt either. (Items 3, 4, 6-10) \n \nThe final debt is owed to a towing service which towed Applicant\u2019s car.  Applicant \nclaims the service sold the car and kept the proceeds.  The amount alleged to be owed \nis $1,644.  This debt is unpaid. (Items 3, 4, 6-10) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt of $12,500.  He \nhas not paid them, and offers no reasonable, good-faith explanation as to why he has \nnot paid these debts listed in the SOR, except that he does not have the money to do \nso.  He is required to repay the education loans, but claims in his FORM Response he \nneeds his income to pay for his housing and current expenses. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer \nexamination. \n  \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. The burden of proof is on him to \nshow that the mitigating conditions should apply to him.  He failed in this burden by not \nshowing that he is repaying any debts except his education loan, or that his problems \nwere beyond his control, or that any of the remaining mitigating conditions could apply.  \nApplicant claimed his income was insufficient to repay his debts.  He did not offer any \ndocuments or statements from anyone to support his contentions that someone else is \nliable on the telephone bill, or that the prepaid credit card debts are the same and that \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nhe does not owe more than $75.  I do not find any potentially mitigating conditions are \nfactors for consideration in this case.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recentcy of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant incurred these debts as \nan adult, the debts are still owed and nothing has been paid on the debts except for the \neducation loan, and he did not present any evidence of any changes in his spending \nhabits to show the same situation will not occur in the future.  His statements show his \nincome is insufficient to repay these debts for several years in the future, at least, so the \nsituation will recur.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress exists \nbecause of the size of Applicant\u2019s debt. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as \nto Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 40, 47). He has been employed in security by a defense contractor since May 2001, and he has been a supervisor for a government contractor that provides security services since 2005 (Tr. 35, 39). He supervises personnel who provide physical security at three sites (Tr. 36). He was selected employee of the year in 2004 (Tr. 44). He married in 1997 and divorced in 1999 (GE 1, Tr. 47). He has two children, ages 10 and nine (Tr. 37). He is engaged and plans to marry in November 2009 (Tr. 40).

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge: \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s debts initially became delinquent due to circumstances \nbeyond his control. Recently, he demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt \nrepayment. He mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 20, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On December \n16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing \nthe basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed \nJune 23, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn January 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March \n24, 2009. Between March 30, 2009, and April 3, 2009, Applicant received oral notice of \nthe hearing (Tr. 8). On April 7, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. At the hearing, \nApplicant elected to proceed without delaying the hearing (Tr. 8-9). The hearing was \nheld on April 20, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE \n1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 11-12), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits (Tr. 20). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-7 (Tr. 12). Additionally, I admitted the Notice \nof Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GEs 8-10). I received the transcript on April \n28, 2009. I held the record open until May 22, 2009, to provide Applicant an opportunity \nto provide additional evidence (Tr. 57-58). After the hearing I received five exhibits from \nApplicant. Department Counsel did not object to my consideration of these five exhibits \nand I admitted them into evidence (AE A-E).     \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c to 1.e and 1.h; and he denied responsibility for SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f and 1.g \n(GE 10). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 40, 47). He has \nbeen employed in security by a defense contractor since May 2001, and he has been a \nsupervisor for a government contractor that provides security services since 2005 (Tr. \n35, 39). He supervises personnel who provide physical security at three sites (Tr. 36). \nHe was selected employee of the year in 2004 (Tr. 44). He married in 1997 and \ndivorced in 1999 (GE 1, Tr. 47). He has two children, ages 10 and nine (Tr. 37).  He is \nengaged and plans to marry in November 2009 (Tr. 40).  He served in the U.S. Marine \nCorps from 1996 to 2000 and earned an Honorable Discharge from the Marine Corps \n(Tr. 42-43). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant was unemployed from February to May 2001 (Tr. 43). When he was \nhired at his current employment, he was paid $10.50 an hour, and now, four years later, \nhe is making $1650 per hour (Tr. 44). The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g are paid. The \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d as well as 1.c and 1.h are duplications of each other. The \nsource, status, and amount of his individual SOR debts are more specifically described \nas follows (paragraph letters correspond with the SOR subparagraphs): \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n(a) Debt for $608 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He admitted he had an account; however, he did \nnot believe he owed the creditor because the telephones he received were turned off \nand then turned on again (Tr. 16-17, 21). He disputed the applicability of the original \ntwo-year contract with the creditor because he used the telephone services for five \nyears (Tr. 21-22). He telephoned the creditor about the dispute; however, he did not \nprovide documentation disputing the debt (Tr. 21-22). On May 18, 2009, he received a \nsettlement offer for $250 (AE E). On May 19, 2009, he paid this debt (AE E); \n \n(b) Credit card debt for $4,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) became delinquent when Applicant \nwas unemployed (Tr. 22). He used this credit card for living expenses when he was \nunemployed (Tr. 44). He thought this debt was a duplication of his debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d \n(Tr. 17). When he contacted the bank, he learned the debt was transferred from the \nbank to a collection company (Tr. 24). His credit reports dated March 15, 2006, \nSeptember 9, 2008, and November 21, 2008, indicate the account was transferred or \nsold (GE 4 at 2; GE 6 at 1; GE 7 at 3). I conclude this debt is duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.d; \n \n(c) Department store credit account for $4,926 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant said this \ndebt involved repossession of one of Applicant\u2019s vehicles (Tr. 17). However, his credit \nreport showed it was a department store account and indicated it was assigned to an \nattorney for collection (GE 7 at 5, 6). He had not contacted the creditor at the time of his \nhearing about resolving this debt (Tr. 31). I conclude he is confused about the origin of \nthis account, and this debt is a department store account that is duplicated in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h; \n \n(d) Debt for $16,053 is owed to a collection company (SOR \u00b6 1.d, Tr. 24; GE 6 at \n2). His September 9, 2008, credit report shows a high credit of $8,433 and a balance of \n$16,053 (GE 6 at 2). He made contact with the creditor in the fall of 2008 (Tr. 27). He \nattempted to establish a payment plan, but the bank wanted monthly $1,000 payments \n(Tr. 22-23, 27-28);  \n \n(e) Automobile financing installment account debt for $3,987 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; GE 7 at \n4). The creditor orally advised Applicant that this debt duplicates the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c \n(Tr. 29-31; GE 2 at I-2). However, there was no documentation corroborating the \nassertion that the two debts were duplications (Tr. 30-31), and I find that this debt is not \nduplicated in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s former fianc\u00e9 was using the vehicle and she was \nsupposed to make the payments (Tr. 25). She stopped making the payments, and \nApplicant called the creditor and asked them to pick-up the vehicle (Tr. 25). The creditor \nsold the vehicle at auction (Tr. 25). Applicant has not made arrangements to pay this \ndebt, but plans to work on setting up a payment plan (Tr. 23);  \n \n(f) Debt for $896 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) is listed at GE 7 at 4. Applicant denied the debt \nbecause he did not recognize it (Tr. 31; GE 10). At the time of his hearing, he had not \ncontacted the creditor (Tr. 31). This debt became delinquent in June 2003 (GE 7 at 4);   \n \n(g) Collection account for $293 related to a delinquent medical bill for care \nApplicant\u2019s son received (SOR \u00b6 1.g; GE 7 at 5; AE A). On May 4, 2009, Applicant \n\n \n \n4 \n \nreceived an account statement showing the balance due was zero (AE C). Applicant \nsaid his most recent credit report, dated May 15, 2009, did not show this account (Tr. \n33, 34); \n  \n(h) Department store debt for $3,776 (SOR \u00b6 1.h; GE 7 at 4). This is the same \ndepartment store as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c above. Applicant admitted this debt (Tr. 34). \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 credit report indicates the account was transferred or sold (GE 7 at 4). \nApplicant had not contacted this creditor by the time of his hearing (Tr. 33-35). Applicant \nsaid his most recent credit report, dated May 15, 2009, did not show this account (Tr. \n33). I conclude that this debt is a duplication of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c.  \n \nApplicant paid the following non-SOR debts for $959 in the fall of 2008 and $66 \n(Tr. 13, 20, 28; GE 2 at I-23, I-27). He also maintained his child support in a current \nstatus for the last ten years (Tr. 15-16).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net pay is about $2,200 monthly (Tr. 36). His expenses are: rent-\n$500; child support--$375; groceries and dining out--$250; utilities, phone and cable--\n$365; automobile insurance and gasoline--$300; and Miscellaneous--$165 (Tr. 37-38; \nAE D).  His former spouse may seek an increase to $450 in his child support payment \nas it is 25% of his income (Tr. 45-46). He owns one car, a 1995 model which cost \n$2,000 (Tr. 37). He does not have any credit cards, and has not had any credit cards \nsince 2004 (Tr. 38). He has $1,500 in a savings account and no 401K account (Tr. 41). \n \nOn May 5, 2009, Applicant received credit counseling and assembled a spending \nplan (AE A, D). He did not provide a debt repayment plan because he is attempting to \n\u201cclean up all discrepancies\u201d (AE A). The credit counseling service told Applicant to \ninvestigate his debts and determine their validity (Tr. 41). After he determines their \nvalidity, the credit counseling services is supposed to help him set up a payment plan \n(Tr. 41; AE A).   \n \nA member of the management team employing Applicant, described him as \nintelligent, motivated, dependable and trustworthy (AE B). Applicant saved the life of an \nemployee by providing emergency medical assistance (AE B; Tr. 47-48). He shows \nstrong performance and extreme competence with a high degree of integrity, honesty, \nresponsibility, and loyalty (AE B). Applicant is a dependable leader who contributes to \nmission accomplishment (AE B). \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \n\n \n \n5 \n \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and, \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his SF 86, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR \nresponse and at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further \ninquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n   \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of his unemployment and underemployment after leaving \nactive duty in the U.S. Marine Corps. He receives substantial mitigating credit because \nhis delinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He \nestablished that he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g and he paid two non-SOR \ndebts. He has a plan to pay the remaining debts through a debt counseling service. He \ncredibly promised to pay his debts once he establishes their validity.2    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant received financial counseling, and there are \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d for the reasons stated \nin the preceding paragraph. He understands the security implications of delinquent debt \nand will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established some, but \nnot full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed some, recent good faith3 in the \nresolution of his SOR debts.    \n \n \n2 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance.  This does not imply that this clearance is conditional. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                           \nApplicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity of any debts and \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. His overall recent conduct with his creditors shows he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.4  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. Nevertheless, he established the full applicability \nof AG \u00b6 20(c). Moreover, security concerns are fully mitigated under the \u201cWhole Person \nConcept,\u201d infra at pages 8-10.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. Several of \nApplicant\u2019s debts became delinquent years ago. In 2005, he began his present \nemployment as a supervisor and his pay was increased. And, he should have made \ngreater progress on his debts. He essentially admitted responsibility for his repossessed \ncar-related debt and two credit card/department store-originated collection debts. His \ntotal admitted, unpaid delinquent debt is about $25,000. He showed some effort in 2008 \nand 2009 to resolve his delinquent debts, but could have acted more aggressively to pay \nhis delinquent debts, to seek debt repayment or resolution, and to better document his \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n \n9 \n \nremedial efforts. These factors show some financial irresponsibility and lack of \njudgment. His history of delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit \nfurther inquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His current \nfinancial problems were caused by a factor somewhat beyond his control: (1) \nunemployment, and (2) underemployment. He paid two SOR debts. He paid two non-\nSOR debts. He has a plan to pay his other SOR debts. He does not have any credit \ncards. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nAlthough Applicant is only 33 years old, he has achieved some important \neducational and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and \ndedication. He served on active duty for four years, including service overseas in \nSouthwest Asia. He obtained employment with his current employer in 2001; however, \nhis pay as a security guard was low. In 2005, he was promoted to his current position \nand began to achieve financial stability. He understands how to budget and what he \nneeds to do to establish his financial responsibility. Clearly, he could have acted more \naggressively to resolve his debts, after receiving employment with a government \ncontractor. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt payments by paying two SOR debts and \ntwo non-SOR debts. He is attempting to validate his remaining SOR debts. He has \npromised to pay them if he can establish they are valid debts. See n. 2, supra. I found \nhis statement to be candid, forthright and credible. Applicant has demonstrated his \n\n \n \n10 \n \nloyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service to the Department of Defense \nas a contractor and to the U.S. Marine Corps. He was employee of the year in 2004, \nand saved another employee\u2019s life while on duty. These factors, especially his past \ngovernment service, show sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate security \nconcerns.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.h: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DeLaney, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 29, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn May 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 28, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 26, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant is indebted to Bank of America in the approximate amount of\n$6,194.00. This credit card debt was charged off in 2005.\nApplicant is indebted to DSRM National Bank in the approximate amount of\n$267.00. This debt was placed for collection in 2005.\nApplicant is indebted to Citi in the approximate amount of $2,293.00. This\naccount was charged off in 2005.\nApplicant is indebted to Bank of America in the approximate amount of\n$10,158.00. This debt represents the difference between what the creditor received\nafter it sold applicant\u2019s repossessed vehicle at auction and what applicant still owed on\nthe vehicle loan. This debt was charged off in 2006.\nIn response to the SOR, applicant stated that his inability to satisfy these debts is\nthe result of deaths in his family, which resulted in, among other things, he and his wife\nassuming guardianship of his wife\u2019s handicapped sister. He further stated that, although\nhe is not in the position to address these debts at this time, he \u201chope[s] to one day pay\nthese debts in full.\u201d\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\n\n3\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of being unable to\npay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s numerous delinquent\ndebts are still outstanding. This mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Although\napplicant\u2019s financial problems appear to be at least partially the result of family issues\nbeyond his control, he presented insufficient evidence to establish that he would not be\nexperiencing these problems without these family issues, or that he acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances. Accordingly, this mitigating condition is not applicable.\n\n4\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. This mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition does not apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of not\nmeeting his financial obligations. The evidence establishes that his financial difficulties\nwill most likely continue for some time, leaving him both unable to address the\napproximately $18,900.00 in delinquent unsecured debt listed in the SOR and\nvulnerable to further financial delinquencies. These facts leave me no choice but to\nconclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After reviewing the results\nof the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) sent interrogatories to Applicant to obtain clarification of and/or\nadditional information about adverse information in his background.  After reviewing the\n1\nresults of the background investigation, including Applicant\u2019s response to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nJanuary 28, 2009\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s\n2\naccess to classified information. On August 12, 2008, DOHA sent Applicant a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline E (personal conduct) and\n3\nGuideline H (illegal drug involvement).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on October 1, 2008, and I convened the hearing on October 23, 2008.\nThe government presented two exhibits (Gx. 1 and 2). Applicant testified and presented\nthree witnesses. He also submitted 12 exhibits (Ax. A - L). DOHA received the transcript\nof hearing (Tr.) on or about November 3, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant used marijuana between 2003\nand at least January 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he has purchased marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b);\nthat he used cocaine between 2006 and at least February 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that\nhe intentionally falsified his answer to e-QIP question 24 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and\nDrug Activity), wherein he stated that he used cocaine three times in August 2006, but\nfailed to disclose his most recent alleged use in February 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant\nadmitted with explanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, but denied with\nexplanation the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. In addition to the facts entered through\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I have made the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 26 years old and employed since September 2007 as a software\nengineer for a defense contractor. Applicant attended a well-known university from\nAugust 2000 until May 2007, when he graduated with a B.S. degree in software\nengineering. (Gx. 1) His college career spanned seven years because his major was a\nfive year program, his minor required courses that sometimes were unavailable to him\nbecause of his major, and because he took one semester off to work. Applicant\ngraduated with a 3.2 GPA. (Tr. 57, 65 - 67)\nApplicant used marijuana at least one hundred times between about October\n2003 and January 2007. His last use occurred while he was home on break and driving\naround with his brother. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 71 - 72) While the frequency of his marijuana\nuse varied, over time it averaged between one and two times each month. Applicant\nalso purchased small amounts of marijuana for personal use. He estimates he\npurchased about one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana between 20 and 25 times\nbetween 2003 and 2007. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2) Applicant also used cocaine three times\nbetween 2006 and 2007. His last use occurred in February 2007. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 58)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nApplicant used primarily while at school, although he and his brother and at least one\nfriend used drugs during Applicant\u2019s visits home in 2007.\nApplicant stopped using drugs in 2007 because he was graduating from college\nand would be entering the workforce. He began contacting potential employers and\ninterviewing for jobs around April 2007. As part of the hiring process for a potential\nDepartment of the Navy position, Applicant underwent drug screening in June 2007. All\ntests were negative. (Ax. E) When he was hired for his current position in September\n2007, he was not subjected to drug screening but declared his drug usage in his e-QIP.\nIn October 2008, in preparation for his hearing, Applicant obtained two urinalysis tests\nthat showed he had no illegal drugs in his bloodstream. (Ax. C and D) He has also\nsubmitted a notarized statement of his intent to abstain from illegal drugs in the future\nand acknowledging that his clearance will be automatically revoked should he use\ndrugs. (Ax. I) Finally, Applicant obtained his own psychological evaluation that showed\nApplicant has not been and is not now dependent on illegal drugs. (Ax. J)\nApplicant was interviewed about his drug use in December 2007 by a\ngovernment investigator. In addition to providing details about his use of marijuana, he\nconfirmed he had used cocaine three times as stated in his e-QIP. He also disclosed\nthat his first use of cocaine was in October 2006 and that his last use of cocaine was in\nFebruary 2007. In his e-QIP, he stated all of his cocaine use was in August 2006. There\nwas no discussion during the interview about the discrepancy between Applicant\u2019s e-\nQIP and his statement to the investigator. (Gx. 2)\nApplicant was a good student in high school (Ax. L) as well as in college. He was\nactive in a variety of community and academic organizations. He is an excellent\nemployee, having received very high marks on his first annual performance appraisal.\n(Ax. G) His co-workers and supervisors speak in glowing terms about his work\nperformance and his personal integrity. (Ax. A; Ax. B; Ax. H; Ax. K) They are aware that\nApplicant \u201cexperimented\u201d with drugs in college but do not appear to have detailed\nknowledge about the extent of his drug use. Their recommendations of him are based\non their knowledge of his current lifestyle and job performance. (Tr. 21 - 46)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 24 (Guideline H - Illegal Drugs).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct.\nA security concern may exist when, as stated in AG \u00b6 15, available information\nreflects\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n5\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nHere, it was alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant was trying to mislead the\ngovernment about his drug use when he listed his last use of cocaine as having\noccurred in August 2006 when it actually occurred in February 2007. Because\nApplicant denied this allegation, the government bore the burden of \u201cpresenting\nwitnesses and other evidence to establish facts that have been controverted.\u201d\n(Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.14) As stated in the disqualifying condition\nat AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities;) in order for his answer to be disqualifying, it\nmust be shown Applicant knowingly provided false information about relevant\ninformation in his background in an attempt to mislead the government about that\ninformation. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP statement about his cocaine use, viewed together\nwith his disclosure of his extensive marijuana use and purchases, shows that he\ndid not intend to deceive the government about his drug use. It would make little\nsense for him to try to deceive the government about infrequent use of one illegal\ndrug when he disclosed in the same document that he used another illegal drug\non a frequent and extensive basis.\nThe government has not contested Applicant\u2019s statement in the e-QIP that\nhe used cocaine three times. Further, it is not contested that his use of both\nmarijuana and cocaine ended at the same time. Thus, the scope of his use is not\nin question. Nor was he confronted by the investigator with other information\nabout his cocaine use. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP statement about the dates of his\ncocaine use was an estimate that he clarified without apparent prompting during\nhis interview. The fact his e-QIP answer did not show cocaine use more recent\nthan August 2006 does not appear to have hindered the government\u2019s\nassessment of his drug involvement. In sum, all of the information bearing on\nApplicant\u2019s truthfulness and candor about his background shows he did not\nintend to provide a false answer in his e-QIP as alleged. Accordingly, the security\nconcern alleged in SOR \u00b6 2 is resolved for the Applicant.\nDrug Involvement.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c that Applicant used marijuana extensively from 2003\nuntil 2007, that he purchased marijuana for his personal use on several\noccasions during that period, and that he used cocaine three times between\nAugust 2006 and February 2007. Accordingly, the government\u2019s information\nraises a security concern addressed in AG \u00b6 24 as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\n\n6\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and\nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g.,\nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse (see definition [at AG \u00b6 25(a)]) and AG\n\u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia). By contrast,\navailable information requires application of the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6\n26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) dissociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation). As of the hearing, Applicant had not\nused any illegal drug for about 20 months. His personal and professional circumstances\nhave changed so that he does not associate with his college friends who used drugs\nand he does not live near the college and hometown where he used drugs. Applicant\nstopped using drugs before he left school and, by all accounts, lives a mature, sober\nand responsible lifestyle. While I do not agree that his drug use was \u201cexperimental\u201d as\nhe has argued, his use was confined to the context of his college lifestyle from which he\nhas moved on. \nI have considered all of the information bearing on the allegations under this\nguideline, including positive information about his current circumstances, his stated\nintent to not use drugs in the future under pain of immediate revocation, the negative\ndrug test results and the favorable clinical evaluation of his drug history. I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by the government\u2019s information\nabout his drug involvement. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and H. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant used illegal\ndrugs willingly and extensively for a period of about four years until he was 24 years old.\nHe did so almost exclusively within the context of his college career, which was longer\n\n7\nthan most for a variety of legitimate reasons. His drug involvement ended of his own\nvolition before he left school as he knew such conduct would be incompatible with\nstarting a software engineering career. As required of all applicants, he has been candid\nabout his drug involvement and I found his demeanor at hearing to be sincere and\ncredible. The positive information about his current circumstances supports a\nconclusion that he fully appreciates the security significance of his past conduct and that\nhe is unlikely to use drugs in the future. A fair and commonsense evaluation of this\nrecord shows that the security concerns about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information have been satisfied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all available information, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor Applicant to have access to classified information. Request for a security clearance\nis granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn June 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 11, 2008 and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 26, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nDecember 2, 2008.  A hearing was held on December 2, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on December 15, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\nJanuary 14, 2009\n\n2\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is\ngranted.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of 17\ndocuments:  Background Note: Iran, U.S. Department of State (March 2008); Country\nSpecific Information, Iran, U.S. Department of State (July 2008); Travel Warning, Iran,\nU.S. Department of State (January 2008); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices -\n2007, Iran, U.S. Department of State  (March 2008); Country Reports on Terrorism,\nChapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, U.S. Department of State (April\n2008);Iran: State Sponsors of Terrorism, U.S. Department of State (September 2008);\nThe President of the U.S., Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Iran\n(November 2006); Resident George Bush, Message to the Congress of the U.S. (March\n2008); Iran: Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities, National Intelligence Estimate\n(November 2007); Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence for\nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (February 2008); William J. Burns, Under\nSec. For Political Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Testimony Before the Senate\nForeign Relations Comm., the Strategic Challenges Posed by Iran (July 2008); U.S.\nMaintains Pressure on Iran (March 2008); UN Security Council Resolution 103 on Iran\u2019s\nNuclear Program, U.S. Department of State (April 2008); Iranian Pleads Guilty to\nAttempted Exportation of Arms and Money Laundering, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (April\n2005); New York Man Sentenced for Illegally Exporting Stolen NBC Night Vision Lenses\nfor Delivery to Iran, (August 2005); Singapore Businessman Convicted of Secretly\nDiverting U.S. Military and Civilian Aircraft Parts to the Islamic Republic of Iran (May\n2006); Pennsylvania Company Fined for Export Violations Involving Iran, UAE and Syria\n(May 2006).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292, at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. April 12,\n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875, at 2 (App. Bd. October 12, 2006)(citing ISCR Case No.\n02-18668, at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative Law,\nSec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Iran.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Iran\u2019s current state. Applicant did not exercise his option of\nchallenging these documents.\nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord to afford him an opportunity to provide written character endorsements.   For good\ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to December 8, 2008 to supplement\nthe record.  The Government was afforded two days to respond.  Within the time\npermitted, Applicant faxed endorsements from his pastor and his program manager,\n\n3\nwhich were, in turn, faxed to me. These submissions are admitted as Applicant\u2019s exhibits\nB and C. \nSummary of Pleadings\n                                       \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have (a) a maternal aunt and uncle who\nare citizens and residents of Iran, (b) a maternal aunt who is employed as an accounting\nmanager for an Iranian government department, (c) an uncle who is retired from the\nsame Iranian government department, (d) five paternal aunts who are citizens and\nresidents of Iran (e) told a DoD investigator in a March 2007 interview that the only time\nhe could be vulnerable to blackmail or coercion by foreign interests would occur if his\nparents and/or brothers were in danger while they were traveling in Iran, and (f) told the\nsame DoD investigator that he had no renounced his dual citizenship with Iran doe to\npossible threats to his aunts and uncles currently living in Iran.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR\nwith explanations.  He claimed he has no financial interests of any kind in Iran, and that\nhis parents sold all of their property in Iran and own their own businesses in the U.S.  He\nclaimed that neither he nor his parents have any divided loyalties and cites for support\nhis honorable service in the U.S. Navy from 1996 to 2004, which included numerous\nawards for leadership and merit (receiving an honorable discharge in June 2004).  He\nacknowledged his deep devotion to his parents and brothers and a willingness to give his\nlife for theirs, but cautioned against the unlikelihood he would ever be placed in a life-\nthreatening situation (noting his parents rarely travel to Iran).  He professed his love and\nprofound patriotism for the U.S.  He claimed he has no Iranian passport; he made no\nvisits to Iran in 24 years, and he had no intention to make any trips to Iran in the future,\nabsent any change in the ruling government in Iran to one friendly to the U.S.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old engineering planner for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born in Iran and immigrated (with his parents at age 11) to the U.S.\nin 1984 to escape the Iran-Iraq war and seek a better life in the U.S. (R.T., at 51). He\nenlisted in the Navy in June 1996 (before becoming a U.S. citizen) at the age of 23 (R.T.,\nat 64), and was honorably discharged in 2001.  While serving in the Navy he held a\nconfidential security clearance (R.T., at 65).  He assures he would do nothing that might\njeopardize U.S. interests or his shipmates who could still be in the Navy (R.T., at 68).\nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2006 (R.T., at 64).  He\ncompleted his undergraduate education at a U.S. university and received an MBA in\n\n4\n2005 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 69-70).  Applicant converted to Christianity in 1991 and was\nbaptized 10 years later (R.T., at 44).  He is unmarried and has no children (see ex. 1).\nApplicant\u2019s has two brothers: one older and one younger who live in the U.S. near\napplicant\u2019s parents (R.T., at 53). His older brother teaches business classes in a local\ncommunity college, while his younger brother completed his college studies and works\nfor a U.S. pharmaceutical company (R.T., at 62).  Neither have any plans to return to\nIran.  His parents\u2019 most recent trip to Iran was in 1999 (for a cousin\u2019s wedding).  They\nhave no plans to return again, except possibly to attend a funeral or wedding of a family\nmember (R.T., at 54-55).  His parents have no ties to the Iranian government (R.T., at\n54-55).  They have a net worth in excess of $2 million, which is comprised of their home\nand convalescent homes they own (R.T., at 58-60).  Neither his mother nor father have\nany relationships or ties to the Iranian government, and (like Applicant) are very\nwesternized  (R.T., at 56-58).  His father did serve in the Iranian military when the Shah\nwas in power (R.T., at 51-52).\nApplicant has a maternal aunt and uncle who are citizens and residents of Iran.\nHis uncle is not a blood relative, however, and has limited contact with his family.  His\naunt is a practicing accountant, and his uncle is retired (R.T., at 38).  To the best of his\nknowledge, none of his aunts and uncles (maternal and paternal) residing in Iran have\nany ties to the Iranian government (R.T., at 43).  Applicant has no strong feelings for\neither of his maternal aunts or any of his paternal aunts and uncles residing in Iran (R.T.,\nat 39, 47-48).  He estimates to have spoken to his maternal aunt and uncle maybe three\ntimes in the last 20 years (R.T., at 47).  He has not spoken to any of his paternal aunts\nand uncles within the last 20 years (R.T., at 49-50).  He could not identify most of his\naunts in a line-up, were he asked to do so (R.T., at 50-51).  Applicant believes that his\nmaternal aunt and uncle living in Iran are westernized and are trying to immigrate to New\nZealand (R.T., at 38, 45-46).  \nSince becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has regularly voted in U.S. elections\n(R.T., at 72).  He has a savings plan with his employer valued at round $20,000.00.  He\nowns a home and has a net worth between $400,000.00 and $500,000.00 (R.T., at 71-\n72)  He is a deacon for his church and serves on the board of directors for a\nmanagement society, and he has served on various employer-related association boards\n(R.T., at 72-75).  \nWere Applicant\u2019s parents to return to Iran and encounter trouble with Iranian\nauthorities, he would help them, but never to the extent of jeopardizing U.S. national\nsecurity interests (R.T., at 76-77).  Should any of his aunts or uncles residing in Iran ever\nbe taken hostage by Iranian authorities, he would not feel the same strong emotions he\nwould have for his parents in a similar situation (R.T., at 77-78).  He could not recall the\ncircumstances in his clearance interview in which he expressed reservations about\nrenouncing his Iranian citizenship out of concerns for his aunts and uncles residing in\nIran (R.T., at 79).  Applicant considers himself a loyal U.S. citizen only and accepts he is\na dual citizen of Iran because the Iranian government classifies him as an Iranian citizen\n(R.T., at 79-80). He assured, too, that he does not care what the Iranian government\n\n5\nmight think about any steps he might take to renounce his Iranian citizenship (R.T., at\n79-80).  At the same time, he expressed no intention to initiate steps to renounce his\nIranian citizenship. \nPolitical and economic background of Iran\nAccording to official U.S. State Department documents, Iran is an Islamic republic\nthat is constitutionally constructed and has a head of state, an elected president and\ncounsel of ministers, a legislative body composed of a 290-member Islamic consultative\nassembly, and a judiciary (see Background Note on Iran, supra, at 5).  Throughout its\nlong history, Iran has been ruled by numerous dynasties.  Following a nationalist uprising\nagainst the Shah in 1905, Iran enacted a limited constitution in 1906.  Two years later, oil\nwas discovered, and Iran began its steady ascension  to a modern, secularized political\nsystem. \nUnder the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi (an Iranian officer, who seized control of\nthe government in 1921), Iran enacted policies of modernization and secularization,\nestablished a central government and reasserted its authority over the tribes and\nprovinces (see Background Note on Iran, id., at 3).  During the Allied occupation of\nwestern Iran in 1941, the Shah was forced to abdicate and was succeeded by his son,\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi (see Background Note on Iran, id.).\nDomestic turmoil swept Iran in 1978 as the result of heated religious and political\nopposition to the Shah\u2019s rule and political/economic programs (especially the Shah\u2019s\ninternal security and intelligence service).  And in February 1979, exiled religious leader\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from France to direct a revolution resulting in a\nnew, theocratic republic guided by Islamic principles.  Iran\u2019s 1979 constitution allocates\nthe duties of the chosen religious leaders and governing bodies in such a way that their\nduties often overlap.  Legislative issues on which the Majles (Iran\u2019s legislative governing\nbody) and the Council of Guardians (making up Iran\u2019s religious leadership) fail to agree\nare resolved by the Council of Expediency (a body created by Ayatollah Khomeini in\n1988).  Following the Ayatollah\u2019s death in June 1989, the Assembly of Experts (an\nelected body of senior clerics) chose the outgoing president of the republic (Ali\nKhamenei) to be the Ayatollah\u2019s successor as national religious leader (see Background\nNote on Iran, id., at 4).\nIran\u2019s post-revolution has been marked by an eight-year war with Iraq, internal\npolitical struggles and unrest, and economic disorder.  Its post-revolution regime has\nbeen associated with human rights violations and political turmoil, including the seizure\nof the U.S. Embassy in November 1979 by Iranian militants and the hostage taking of 52\nAmericans (see Background Note on Iran, supra, at 6).  Succeeding power struggles\nhave severely eroded the center and left of Iran\u2019s political institutions, leaving only the\nclergy.  Both human rights and state sponsored terrorism remain serious problems in\nIran and the Middle East.  According to State Department reports, Iran\u2019s Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security Forces have been\ndirectly involved in terrorist acts, and continue to support Palestinian groups with\n\n6\nleadership cadres in Syria and Lebanese Hizballah to use terrorism in pursuit of their\ngoals (see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2007, supra, at 1-5; Country\nReports on terrorism, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, supra, at 1-2).\nState Department reports claim Iranian authorities continue to provide military support\nand guidance to some Iraqi militant groups that target Coalition and Iraqi security forces\nand Iraqi civilians (see Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of\nTerrorism Overview, id.).\n Long estranged from the West, Khomeini\u2019s regime charted regional goals that\ncurtail the presence of the U.S. and other outside powers in the region.  Iran\u2019s Islamic\nforeign policy continues to stress (1) vehement anti-U.S. and anti-Israel positions, (2)\nelimination of outside influence in the region, (3) support for Muslim political movements\nabroad, (4) critical support to non-state terrorist groups, and (5) considerable increase in\ndiplomatic contacts with developing countries (see U.S. Dept. of State Background Note\non Iran, supra; Iran: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, supra, at 1-16;\nCountry Reports on Terrorism 2007, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview,\nsupra, at 1-2).  In this vein, Iran maintains regular diplomatic and commercial relations\nwith Russia and the former Soviet republics.  Of special U.S. concern has been Russian\nsales of military equipment and technology to Iran (see  U.S. Dept. of State Background\nNote on Iran, id., at 8).\nPotential obstacles to improved relations between Iran and the U.S. include\nIranian efforts to acquire technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons and\nother weapons of mass destruction; its support for and involvement in international\nterrorism; its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its\ndismal human rights record (see Statement of President George W. Bush, Message to\nthe Congress of the U.S., supra; President of the U.S., Continuation of the National\nEmergency with Respect to Iran, supra; National Intelligence Estimate, Iran, Nuclear\nIntentions and Capabilities, supra; Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National\nIntelligence for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, supra).\nState Department country reports cite significant restrictions on the right of\ncitizens to change their government, summary executions (minors included),\ndisappearances, torture and severe punishments (such as amputations and flogging),\nviolence by vigilante groups with ties to the government, poor prison conditions, arbitrary\narrest and detention (including prolonged solitary confinement), lack of judicial\nindependence and fair public trials, political prisoners and detainees, excessive\ngovernment violence in Kurdish areas and unknown groups in Arab regions of the\ncountry, severe restrictions on civil liberties and freedom of religion, official corruption,\ngovernment transparency deficiencies, legal and societal discrimination against women,\nethnic and religious minorities, trafficking in persons, incitement of anti-Semitism, severe\nrestriction of workers\u2019 rights, and child labor (see Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices-2007, supra, at 1-24). \nAddressing reports of human rights violations in Iran, the UN General Assembly\nadopted a human rights resolution on Iran in December 2005 that expressed serious\n\n7\nconcern at the continuing use of torture in Iran and cruel, trafficking in persons, inhuman\nand degrading treatment or punishment, such as floggings and amputations, as well as\npublic executions (see Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, supra,\nid., at 3-24). \nEven though Iran\u2019s constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, these\npractices remain common. Its regular and paramilitary security forces that share\nresponsibility with Iranian police for law enforcement and maintaining order are reported\nto have committed numerous, serious human rights abuses in recent years (see Iran,\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, Iran, supra). Security forces\nresponsible for arrest and detention often do not inform family members of a prisoner\u2019s\nwelfare and location, and often deny visits by family members and counsel.\nState Department travel warnings urge U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks\nof travel to Iran (see Travel Warning, Iran, 2008, supra), a country with which the U.S.\ndoes not currently have diplomatic or consular relations.  Citing Iran\u2019s non-recognition of\ndual citizenship and general declination to permit the Swiss to provide protective\nservices for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals, Americans who travel to Iran\nare strongly encouraged to register through the State Department\u2019s travel registration\nwebsite (see Travel Warning, Iran, 2008, id.).\nDual citizens residing or visiting in Iran are subject to all Iranian laws affecting\nU.S. citizens, as well as laws applicable to persons of Iranian nationality that impose\nspecial obligations on citizens of that country (see Travel Warning, Iran, 2008, id.; Iran,\nCountry Specific Information, supra, at 1-2).  Dual nationals remain subject to Iran\u2019s\nmilitary service requirements and can be conscripted into service while on Iranian soil.\nWhile such conscripted service seems unlikely to confront Applicant, given his age and\nlongstanding U.S. citizenship, it remains a possibility should he decide to visit Iran.\nReports indicate, too, that Iranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors\nunder surveillance, and even arrest or detain Iranian-Americans suspected of \u201cacting\nagainst national security\u201d  (see Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007,\nsupra, at 5-6; Iran, Country Specific Information,  id., at 2-3). \n Because the Iranian government does not recognize dual nationality and will treat\nU.S.-Iranian dual nationals as Iranian citizens, regardless of their U.S. naturalization\nstatus, dual nationals who enter Iran only on a U.S. passport risk detention absent\npersuasive proof of their formal renunciation or loss of their Iranian citizenship (see Iran,\nCountry Specific Information, Iran, supra,  at 1-2). \nCharacter assessments\nApplicant has received excellent endorsements from his company\u2019s management.\nHis supervisors describe him as a dependable staff planner and team player who is\nhighly motivated and very trustworthy (see ex. A).  His coworkers credit him with strong\ncharacter and integrity with a reputation for dedication and sincerity on and off the job\n(ex. A). \n\n8\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but\nnot limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  See Adjudicative Guideline, \u00b6 6.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\n\n9\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated with his parents to the U.S.\nfrom Iran in 1984 to escape the turmoil wrought by the Iran-Iraq war.  Security concerns\nfocus on members of Applicant\u2019s family (i.e., his maternal and paternal aunts and uncles)\nwho are citizens and residents of Iran.  Because the Iranian government\u2019s military and\nintelligence authorities have a history of violating Iranian and international laws and\ndiplomatic protocols, they are more likely to use improper and/or illegal means to obtain\nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control through his family members\nstill residing in Iran. \nBy virtue of the Iranian citizenship and residency of Applicant\u2019s maternal aunts\nand uncles in Iran, they present potential heightened security risks covered by\ndisqualifying condition  (DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.\nThe citizenship/residence status of these family members in Iran pose potential concerns\nfor Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise\nsensitive or classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control. \nAlthough none of Applicant\u2019s family members residing in Iran have any identified\nIranian prior military or intelligence service, they have worked for an Iranian government\nagency.  His aunt works currently for the same governmental in Iran that his husband\npreviously retired from. On the strength of these connections alone, they resent some\nconcerns over the potential for compromise and coercion for so long as they reside in\nIran.  Were either of these family members to be placed in a hostage situation, Applicant\ncould be subject to conflicts over ensuring their well being and protecting classified\ninformation.  For this reason, DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d applies to the\nfacts of this case. \n\n10\nTo be sure,  none of Applicant\u2019s  aunts and uncles residing in Iran have any\nhistory to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence.  These historical\nantecedents, when considered together with Applicant\u2019s limited contact with these\nextended family members, do limit the severity of a conflict situation.  However, the\nabsence of any past coercive measures taken by Iranian authorities does not completely\nabsolve Applicant from coercive risks in the future.   Iran does have a checkered history\nof hostage taking and abusive measures taken against its own citizens and U.S.\ndiplomats, and, as a result, must be assigned heightened risk status under the Guideline\nB guideline. \nStill, upon fully considering Applicant\u2019s very limited contact with his relatives in\nIran, his demonstrated devotion to U.S. interests and values, and the lack of any\nreported associations between his aunts and uncles and Iran\u2019s military and intelligence\nagencies, risks of undue foreign influence on Applicant and/or his family members\nresiding in Iran in the foreseeable future are likely to be minimal.  Heightened security\nrisks created by Iran\u2019s political status are considerably weakened as the result of the\nconflation of Applicant\u2019s demonstrated commitments to the U.S., his limited contacts with\nhis aunts and uncles in recent years , and the lack of any record of pressure or\ncompromise attempts wrought against Applicant\u2019s relatives residing in Iran.  \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing security clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of\nforeign influence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel\nsecurity assessments necessarily embrace similar risk assessments under the new\nDirective guidelines for assessing foreign influence risks and concerns associated with\nthe individual's having family abroad, which include both common sense assessments of\ncountry risks and information available from public sources. \nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, though, the new ones do take into account\nthe country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in\ngauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create\na heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter. \nAs demonstrated, Iran has long been known to be a repressive country, who has\ncommitted numerous, serious human rights abuses in recent years, and shown little\nrespect for the rule of law.  The U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Iran.  Iran remains\na country on the State Department \u2018s state terrorist list, and one with a known history of\nhostage taking and human rights abuses of wide magnitude and scope. Iran is\nconsistently characterized as a country hostile to American political and security interests\nsince the 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran and ensuing establishment of an Islamic republic\nwith close ties and support to non-state terrorist groups.  Based on reported terrorist\nactivities in the country and in other countries in the region with support links to Iran, Iran\n\n11\ncannot be deemed to provide an acceptable political and security environment for\nmanaging hostage risks.  \nTo be sure, little is known about Applicant\u2019s maternal aunts and uncles\nrelationships with the Iranian agency they have current and past associations with,\nrespectively. Even less is known about applicant\u2019s paternal aunts and uncles.\nApplicant\u2019s maternal and paternal aunts and uncles residing in Iran.  Concerns about a\npotential hostage situation are considerably diminished, however, by the lack of any\nclose Applicant relations or contacts with these relatives. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s case-specific circumstances, MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npersons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\u201d  is unavailable to Applicant.  While his parents and siblings (long U.S. citizens and\nresidents) are for the most part insulated from potential pressures and influence from the\nIranian government and its military and intelligence officials., the same cannot said for\nApplicant \u2018s aunts and uncles residing in Iran without more data on their associations, or\nlack thereof, with Iranian government agencies.  Applicant, accordingly, may not take\nadvantage of any of the mitigation benefits of MC 8(a).\n By contrast, MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d is fully available to Applicant.  Applicant\u2019s\ndemonstrated loyalty and commitment to the U.S. and its institutions and values, his\nparents\u2019 U.S. citizenship and residency, the absence of any history of coercive measures\ntaken against any of Applicant\u2019s aunts and uncles, and Applicant\u2019s very limited contacts\nand ties with these same aunts and uncles, are well supported in this administrative\nrecord.\nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to\nthe U.S., are credible and substantial.  Considered together with his very limited contact\nwith his extended family members residing in Iran, the absence of any historical attempts\nto pressure or coerce any of Applicant\u2019s family members in Iran, and Applicant\u2019s very\nlimited contacts and ties with these same aunts and uncles, Applicant\u2019s case-specific\ncircumstances are enough to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his\nrelationships with his spouse and his wife\u2019s parents.  MC 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication\nwith foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has some applicability herein to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.\n\n12\nOne other mitigating condition has mixed application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  MC\n8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding\nthe reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations\nfrom a foreign country,\u201d has some prospective value based on Applicant\u2019s long tenure of\nholding a security clearance in the Navy and his demonstrated loyalty and commitments\nto U.S. security interests.  It is true that our Appeal Board has accorded very little weight\nto stated intentions to take corrective steps in a hypothetical set of circumstances,\nabsent record evidence that an applicant has acted similarly under comparable\ncircumstances.  See ISCR Case No. 07-00029, at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007); ISCR Case\nNo. 06-24575, at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007). Applicant\u2019s long and meritorious Navy\nservice and demonstrated loyalties to U.S. core security interests and values make him a\nvery credible applicant for reporting any potential compromise attempts on any of his\nrelatives residing in Iran.  \nGiven that Iran remains a hostile country with no diplomatic relations with the\nU.S., and one that lacks a secure infrastructure and track record for respecting human\nrights and the rule of law, the risk of a pressure or influence situation involving even an\nextended family member of Applicant\u2019s must be carefully scrutinized.  Conflation of all of\nthe circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s devoted Navy service and commitments to\nU.S. security interests and core values, Iran\u2019s country status, Applicant\u2019s limited contacts\nwith his aunts and uncles residing in Iran, the unlikelihood of his parents or brothers\ntraveling to Iran in the foreseeable future, and the absence of any prior pressure\nattempts by the Iranian government to pressure, exploit or coerce any of Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives residing in Iran augur well for Applicant in making the necessary predictive\njudgments about whether risks of pressure an coercion are mitigated.  \nWhole person assessment permits mitigation of Applicant\u2019s exposure to potential\npainful choices over ensuring the safety and well being of his maternal aunts and uncles\nresiding in Iran.  To his credit, Applicant is a fully Americanized U.S. citizen with\ndemonstrated strong loyalties and commitments to U.S. core values.  The trust he has\ninspired with his supervisors, coworkers, and friends promise to ensure that he would\nreport any Iranian pressures or contacts to his facility security officer and not permit\nhimself to be pressured by Iranian authorities in any hypothetical hostage situation. \nApplicant\u2019s honorable service in the U.S. Navy, his past holding of a security\nclearance in the Navy, the strong roots his parents and brothers have established in the\nU.S., and the unlikelihood that any of his immediate family members will be traveling to\nIran in the foreseeable future make the potential risks of a hostage situation in Iran that\ncould require Applicant to make difficult choices between protecting his family and\nsafeguarding classified information unlikely.  \n                                                                                                                                \n            By all accounts, Applicant and his immediate family members residing in the U.S.\nare fully Americanized and committed to the obligations and responsibilities expected of\nU.S. citizens.   By contrast, Applicant is not very close to his aunts and uncles residing in\n\n13\nIran and much less likely to compromise national security to protect them in any potential\nconfrontation with Iranian authorities. \nAfter carefully considering Applicant\u2019s familial connections in the U.S. and Iran\nand the risks of Applicant submission to Iranian pressures should any of his family\nmembers residing in Iran be pressured or coerced by Iranian authorities at some time in\nthe foreseeable future, the weighted risks of a compromise are sufficiently discounted to\nbecome manageable ones at this time under a whole person assessment of all of the\ncritical circumstances considered in this case.\nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's relations with\nhis aunts and uncles residing in Iran are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to\nhis familial relationships with relatives residing in Iran.  Favorable conclusions warrant\nwith respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.f of Guideline B.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\n In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

On December 11, 2007, approximately a month after Applicant completed a security clearance application, he was interviewed by a security clearance investigator. When asked about his marijuana consumption, he stated that he had no intention of using it again, but would probably smoke some if his friends brought some to his home (Answer). Three weeks later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, Applicant\u2019s friends visited him, brought some marijuana, and Applicant sampled some of it (Id.). He then resolved to quit using marijuana.

On these occasions, he smokes it with\nfriends who bring it with them when they visit his home (Tr. 19). \nOn December 11, 2007, approximately a month after Applicant completed a\nsecurity clearance application, he was interviewed by a security clearance investigator.\nWhen asked about his marijuana consumption, he stated that he had no intention of\nusing it again, but would probably smoke some if his friends brought some to his home\n(Answer).\nThree weeks later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, Applicant\u2019s friends visited him, brought\nsome marijuana, and Applicant sampled some of it (Id.). He then resolved to quit using\nmarijuana. He has made similar resolutions five times before (Tr. 23). Applicant\nattributes his continued marijuana use to peer pressure (Tr. 34). \nApplicant has not used marijuana since December 2007, and does not intend to\nuse it again. His wife never approved of his past use, and he wants to set a good\nexample for his daughter, who is now a teenager.  He is now more conscientious about\n1\nthe risks to his career that continued use could pose.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n3\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 24). Applicant\u2019s 28-year history of\nmarijuana, spanning from his teenage years to December 2007, three weeks after he\nwas interviewed by a security clearance investigator, triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n25(a), any drug abuse, 25( c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and\n25(h), \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\u201d\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant,\na 43-year-old man, attributed his continued use into middle-age to peer pressure,\nsomething normally a problem for teenagers. His last episode of marijuana use\ncorresponded with a vow to quit, but he has made similar vows in the past. Also, it\noccurred less than a month after he met with a security clearance investigator. Given\nthe length of time that he abused marijuana in the past, the recency of his last use, and\nhis nonchalant attitude he held as recently as November 2007 about the seriousness of\nmarijuana use, it remains a security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG \u00b6\n15). Specifically, Applicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal\n\n4\nconduct  . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as\n. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing . . . \u201c None of the mitigating conditions apply for the\nsame reasons set forth in the Drug Involvement section of the Decision, above.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d\nApplicant deserves credit for disclosing the extent of his marijuana use. He is\ncommitted to his job. These positive attributes are outweighed by the frequency and\nextent of his past marijuana use. After evaluating this case in the context of the whole\nperson concept, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked for one year as an employee and three preceding years as a subcontractor employee. He is an engineer who has worked in the aerospace industry since the 1980s. He has never married and has no children. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d, and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Laura J. Anderson, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has substantial delinquent debt incurred seven years ago that he has\nmade no effort to repay despite more than six years of steady, well-paying employment.\nBased upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86), on\nOctober 10, 2007. On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nNovember 10, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 14, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 20, 2008, and DOHA\nassigned the case to me on August 21, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 3, 2008, and Applicant\u2019s counsel\nacknowledged receiving it at least 15 days before the hearing. (Tr. at 20.) I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled on September 26, 2008. Applicant was not present at the\nhearing, but his counsel was present. She represented that Applicant was not present\nbecause he wished to \u201cwithdraw his appeal of the DOHA action\u201d and prevent any final\ndecision being made concerning his security clearance. She had advised him that she\nwould seek this outcome and he did not need to be present. She was informed that\nApplicant did not have the option to unilaterally withdraw from this process, and that the\ncase must continue to resolution unless and until his employer reported through JPAS\nthat he no longer required a security clearance. \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant\u2019s Counsel were given time to contact the\nemployer\u2019s facility security office and DOHA\u2019s JPAS coordinator to determine whether\nhis employer had reported that his security clearance application was withdrawn. All\nsources consulted indicated that he remained an employee and the security clearance\napplication remained active. Applicant\u2019s counsel was granted a 70-minute continuance\nto contact the Applicant and determine when he could be present. At the conclusion of\nthe continuance, she had been unable to contact him in any manner. I determined that\nApplicant was absent with good cause, since he had relied on his counsel\u2019s good faith\nbut incorrect advice that he did not need to be present. Accordingly, case processing\nwas not terminated since the criteria of DOHA OI 28 and Directive \u00b6 4.4 were not met.\n(See ISCR Case No. 07-05632 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008.)) Applicant\u2019s counsel\nexpressed her desire, subject to possible change after further consultation with\nApplicant, to respond to the Government\u2019s case in writing. She was given until October\n10, 2008 to do so, and to request an additional session of the hearing if she or Applicant\ndesired another opportunity to appear in person before the administrative judge. (Tr. at\n6-18.)\nApplicant and his counsel submitted a written brief and affidavit, via Department\nCounsel, on October 10, 2008. Applicant signed the affidavit attesting to the truth of the\nfacts asserted in the brief, and neither he nor his counsel requested further hearing\nproceedings to permit his personal appearance. Under the criteria of ISCR Case No.\n06-13610 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2008), I find that Applicant and his counsel thereby\nknowingly and intelligently waived his right to present his case by means of a hearing in\nwhich he appears in person under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. Accordingly, the case will be\ndecided based on the written record pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.7.\nBefore the hearing was continued for two weeks to permit Applicant\u2019s Counsel to\nconfer with him, determine whether his employer desired to withdraw his application,\nand present any evidence they desired, Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s brief,\n\n3\naffidavit, and forwarding cover letters were marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which\nwas also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non October 7, 2008. The transcript is also incorporated into the written record for use in\ndeciding this case. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor one year as an employee and three preceding years as a subcontractor employee.\nHe is an engineer who has worked in the aerospace industry since the 1980s. He has\nnever married and has no children. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d, and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and\n1.e. The two admitted allegations involve delinquent debts totaling $15,716, both of\nwhich became delinquent in late 2001. Those admissions are incorporated in the\nfollowing findings. \nIn 1995, using profits from some favorable stock investments, Applicant\npurchased a private airplane. Applicant went through a period of unemployment or\nunderemployment from February 2000 to July 2002. On his September 2003 SF-86, he\nlisted periods of unemployment from February to August 2000, and again from\nSeptember 2000 to July 2002 after one month of employment from August to\nSeptember 2000. (GE 1 at 3-4.) However, his October 2007 SF 86, presently pending\nadjudication, states that he was employed from October 2000 to July 2002 as a contract\nengineer for a company working on various aviation projects. (GE 4 at 3.)\nApplicant took out several loans and incurred credit card balances during this\ntime that he could not repay. He got a well-paying job again in July 2002, and was able\nto bring his mortgage payments current in time to stop the foreclosure proceedings\nagainst his home that were begun by his creditor. His payments on his airplane loan\nhad also fallen behind, and that lender repossessed and resold the airplane. Applicant\nwas required to repay the deficit remaining on that loan, as well as substantial attorney\nfees for the associated litigation. (GE 3 at 2-3; AE A at 3-4.)\nDuring his November 2003 interview with a special agent of the Defense Security\nService, Applicant admitted owing the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and\n1.d. He said he intended to repay those debts by the end of 2004, and produced a\nfinancial statement showing assets of $135,285 and a monthly remainder of income\nover expenses of $2,016. (GE 3 at 1-4.) In his April 2008 response to interrogatories, he\ndenied owing the $181 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but said, \u201cI have not addressed this\ndebt yet,\u201d concerning the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. He\nfurther stated that he would pay those bills when other priorities were settled. (GE 7 at\n8-11.) His written submission added no information concerning repayment of any of\nthese debts, but sought instead to attribute them to periods of unemployment beginning\nin 1990 and 2002. (AE A.) No other evidence was submitted concerning his\ntrustworthiness, responsibility, or judgment. He did not explain why he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n\n4\n1.a and 1.e in his formal response to the SOR, nor provide proof the debts were\nresolved.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances: \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n(Tr. at 24.)\nApplicant has at least a seven-year history of failing to satisfy legitimate financial\nobligations. He admitted he has made no effort to resolve at least two of them totaling\nmore than $15,700 that have been delinquent since 2001. He provided no evidence that\nhe either resolved or formally disputed any of the SOR-listed debts, although he has\nconsistently denied owing the $181 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and it no longer appears\non his most recent credit report (GE 8). All of these debts became delinquent during\n2001, but Applicant has not resolved them despite being continuously employed in well-\npaying jobs since July 2002. Substantial security concerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a) and 19(c).\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The five\npotentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n6\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented roof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose seven years ago, and a substantial number\nand amount remain delinquent at present. Despite being continuously employed since\nJuly 2002, he demonstrated no effort to resolve or formally dispute any of the SOR-\nlisted debts. As recently as April 2008, he admitted not having addressed the largest\nfour of them. Applicant offered no evidence that he either sought or followed financial\ncounseling, or that he has any comprehensive plan to address his debts. He has not\ncontacted these creditors to arrange repayments despite his 2003 statements of intent\nand ability to do so by the end of 2004. He said that he disputes the alleged $181\ntelephone debt, but has not followed through with the creditor about that liability. There\nis insufficient indication in this record that his financial issues are either under control or\nlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. \nThe Appeal Board explained the analysis applicable to determining whether an\napplicant has mitigated financial concerns arising from delinquent debt as follows:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\n\n7\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant demonstrated\nneither a plan to resolve his financial problems nor any significant action toward such\nresolution despite more than six years of steady and well-paying employment.\nAccordingly, he has not established substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through\n(e). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves substantial delinquent debts that he has not yet started to repay.\nApplicant is a mature, experienced adult who is accountable for his decisions and\nconduct. He voluntarily incurred these debts during a period that he was spending more\nmoney than he was earning, including buying a house and private airplane.\nApplicant\u2019s debts arose seven years ago, and persist to date. There is ongoing\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress since he remains financially\noverextended. Applicant offered no evidence of rehabilitation, behavioral changes, or\nthat continuation of his financial irresponsibility is unlikely. Despite his knowledge of\nsecurity concerns raised by these delinquent debts, he chooses to use his financial\nresources on other priorities. \nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness security concerns arising from his failure to satisfy debts, and history of\n\n8\nnot meeting financial obligations. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: William Savarino, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nIn 1996, Applicant and his spouse fled Iraq and settled in the United States with \nU.S. State Department assistance. In 2004, Applicant and his spouse became U.S. \ncitizens. Their three children are U.S. citizens. Applicant returned to Iraq in 2007 and \n2008, serving with U.S. combat forces as a translator. Applicant has volunteered to \nreturn to Iraq to continue his translator duties. Those who served with him in Iraq laud \nhis duty performance and contributions to mission accomplishment. Applicant has \nsignificantly greater contacts with the United States than with Iraq. He can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests. Foreign influence security \nconcerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 22, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On March 11, \n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, alleging security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence) (GE 8). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 17, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (GE 9). Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non April 1, 2009. The case was assigned to me on April 14, 2009. On April 14, 2009, \nDOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 7). The hearing was held on April 29, 2009.1 At the \nhearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 17), and \nApplicant offered 13 exhibits (Tr. 18; AE A-M). There were no objections, and I admitted \nGEs 1-6 (Tr. 17-18), and AEs A-M (Tr. 18-19). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, \nresponse to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on May \n18, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice (AN) of facts concerning \nIraq (AN Request with Ex. I to V; Tr. 9-11). Department Counsel provided supporting \ndocuments to show detail and context for these facts. At Applicant\u2019s request, I took \nadministrative notice of all of the facts in Department Counsel\u2019s cover document, \nsubject to verification in the underlying documents (Tr. 10-11; AN I-V). I also indicated, I \nwould take administrative notice of information concerning elections in Iraq, and other \npertinent information about the relationship between Iraq and the United States from AN \nI\u2013V (Tr. 10-11). See the Iraq section in the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings, is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \n \n \n \n \n1 Applicant requested an expedited hearing and specifically waived his right to 15 days\u2019 notice of \nthe date and location of his hearing (Tr. 12-13). \n  \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations (GE 8) in his response to the SOR (GE \n9). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. \n   \nApplicant is 42 years old and has worked as a translator for a government \ncontractor since 2007 (Tr. 34, 43). He was born in Kurdistan, Iraq (Tr. 33). Applicant \nreceived his education through his college degree in accounting in Kurdistan, Iraq (Tr. \n34, 43). In 1990, he was drafted into the Iraqi Air Force (Tr. 90). After nine months of \nservice, he left military service with many of the other Kurds because they did not want \nto fight against the U.S. Army (Tr. 90-91). After the first Gulf War, Applicant received \nemployment from a U.S. based company with a branch in Kurdistan, Iraq (Tr. 34-35). \nHe worked as an accountant, assistant project manager and project manager (Tr. 35, \n37; AE L). \n \nIn 1996, Saddam Hussein used the Iraqi Army to attack the Kurdish area of Iraq, \nand Applicant learned he was going to be arrested (Tr. 39-40). The U.S. State \nDepartment did an emergency evacuation of Applicant and his spouse to Guam (Tr. 39-\n40). Travel and quarters for three months at a U.S. Air Force Base were at U.S. \ngovernment expense (Tr. 39-41). His son was born in a U.S. hospital in Guam (Tr. 40). \nThe U.S. State Department provided authorization for U.S. employment, and Applicant \nmoved to a state, where he worked in automobile sales (Tr. 42). Applicant has taken \ncourses towards a master\u2019s degree in the United States (Tr. 83). \n \nIn 2007, Applicant received an interim, Category II Secret clearance (Tr. 44-45). \nHe served in Iraq from April to August 2007 (Tr. 45, 85). He was in an accident, and \ncame back to the United States for surgery (Tr. 45, 88-89). He needed four or five \nmonths to recover (Tr. 85). He was ready to return to Iraq, but in May 2008, the \ncorporation that sent him to Iraq lost their U.S. government contract (Tr. 46-47, 86).  His \nreturn to Iraq was further delayed because of security reasons involving the transfer of \nhis JPAS account from one contractor to another (Tr. 46-47). In the fall of 2008, he \nworked as a consultant teaching others how to negotiate with Iraqis (Tr. 48-49; AE E). \nFrom the end of October to December 2008, he served the U.S. Department of Defense \nin Iraq as a translator, working for a new U.S. government contractor (Tr. 87, 89).  \n \nApplicant married in 1996 in Iraq (Tr. 37, 38). All three of his children were born \nin the United States and currently live in the United States (Tr. 50, 78). In February \n2004, Applicant and his spouse became U.S. citizens (Tr. 51, 91-92). Applicant\u2019s \nspouse does not work outside their home (Tr. 52). He told his wife not to discuss his \nwork for the United States government with family members (Tr. 81-82). His spouse \ntalks to her family in Iraq at least once a month (Tr. 96, 97). Applicant does not intend to \nlive permanently in Iraq (Tr. 82). \n \n \n2The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information.  \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased, and his mother has not remarried (Tr. 52-53). His \nmother, who is a citizen of Iraq, moved to the United States in 1998 (Tr. 92). She has \nresided with Applicant in the United States since at least March 2007 (Tr. 94-95; SOR \u00b6 \n1.a; SOR response). Applicant provides her food and shelter, and provides her funds to \nvisit her family in Iraq (Tr. 94-95). She currently has a green card (Tr. 51, 93; SOR \nresponse). She definitely intends to apply to become a U.S. citizen as soon as she is \neligible (Tr. 52). She has returned to Iraq to visit her family about six or seven times \nover the last ten years (Tr. 93). She has stayed in Iraq on her post-1998 visits from 15 \nto 90 days (Tr. 94). \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Kurdistan-Iraq \n(Tr. 53; SOR \u00b6 1.b; SOR response). She is a teacher in a trade school (Tr. 53). \nApplicant talks to his sister about every two or three months, usually when his mother \ncalls her (Tr. 79). He does not talk to his brothers-in-law or sister-in-law (Tr. 79). One of \nhis brothers-in-law is employed by a small import and export business (Tr. 54; SOR \u00b6 \n1.c; SOR response). Another brother-in-law and a sister-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Kurdistan-Iraq (Tr. 54-55). His sister-in-law is an engineer, and he is unsure \nwhat her spouse does for a living (Tr. 54-55).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). He only talks to his father-in-law or mother-in-law when his wife happens \nto call them (Tr. 79). He saw them about three years ago when he went to Iraq (Tr. 97). \nHe might talk to them about every three months (Tr. 80). His father-in-law is 72-years-\nold and retired (Tr. 55). He lives on rent accruing from shops and land (Tr. 56, 98). His \nmother-in-law has never worked outside her home (Tr. 56). \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed family members work for a foreign military or \nhave ties to a foreign government (Tr. 56). He owns his own home in the United States, \nand does not own any property in Iraq (Tr. 77).   \n \nApplicant traveled to Kurdistan-Iraq in April 2000, September 2002, March 2005, \nand November 2006 (Tr. 57-60). He went to Iraq to visit his family. In 2006, he had a job \ninterview in Iraq (Tr. 57-60; SOR \u00b6 1.e; SOR response). He was offered employment; \nhowever, he decided not to take the job because the pay was inadequate (Tr. 58). He \nhas never been questioned by Iraqi authorities or the Iraqi police about his U.S. \nemployment (Tr. 60).  \n \nApplicant decided to become a translator to pay back the United States for \nproviding sanctuary for himself and his family (Tr. 44). When serving in Iraq as a \ntranslator, he was located in a part of Kurdistan-Iraq that was very dangerous (Tr. 61-\n62). They went on missions in military vehicles, such as helicopters or HMMWVs (Tr. \n62). He has been out when shooting occurred; however, he could not attest that anyone \nshot at him personally (Tr. 98). When on patrols, he wears a military uniform, body \narmor and a helmet (Tr. 99-100). In 2007, he was photographed shaking hands with \nGeneral Petraeus (Tr. 63; AE A). At that time, Applicant worked in the same building as \nGeneral Petraeus and translated for him on one occasion (Tr. 63-64). He also worked \nfor the Criminal Court in Iraq to help build cases (Tr. 64-65). If the enemy attempted to \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \npressure him for classified information by threatening his family, he would report the \nthreat to his commander (Tr. 76). He is ready to immediately return to Iraq to support \nthe troops and his family (Tr. 100). He thought he could be back in Iraq within a week of \nhaving his clearance restored (Tr. 100).  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s program manager (PM) provides translator support to several \nsensitive Department of Defense entities (Tr. 21-22). PM has a Top Secret clearance \nwith access to sensitive compartmented information (Tr. 22). He has known Applicant \nfor about a year in a professional, but not a personal capacity (Tr. 22-23). Applicant \nprovides translator services in Kurdish and modern Gulf-dialect Arabic (Tr. 22). When \nApplicant came to work for PM, he had an interim Secret clearance (Tr. 23). Applicant \nworked out of a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Iraq (Tr. 24). Applicant\u2019s duties in \nIraq were hazardous as he interfaced with counterintelligence, human sources in field \nlocations (Tr. 24-25). Outside the FOB, he went on armed patrols, where people were \ninjured and killed in combat operations (Tr. 25). He did not directly supervise Applicant \n(Tr. 26). He received information from military field officers about Applicant\u2019s work \nproduct and duty performance (Tr. 26). Applicant received exceptional accolades from \nthe field commander about his ability, dedication and contributions to the mission (Tr. \n26-27). His performance in a combat zone was described as \u201camazing\u201d and \n\u201castounding\u201d (Tr. 31). \n \nApplicant took a polygraph examination in connection as part of the processing of \nhis file for consideration of a Top Secret clearance (Tr. 28). On March 13, 2009, \nApplicant passed a full-scope polygraph examination (Tr. 28-29). Applicant carefully \nfollows security rules (Tr. 29-30).  PM would like to have Applicant return to work for his \ncompany (Tr. 30). Applicant is very trustworthy and reliable (Tr. 31).         \n \nIn 2008, Applicant received two very strong letters of support from his \ncommander, and his unit\u2019s operations officer because of his assistance to mission \naccomplishment in Iraq (Tr. 66-68; AE C, AE D). They described him as being \n\u201cextremely hard working and a true team player\u201d (AE C), being very knowledgeable (AE \nD), having exceptional leadership (AE D), and being a \u201csuperb asset\u201d (AE C). They \nrecommended his continued service in Iraq and expressed their hopes that they could \ncontinue to serve with him in the hazardous combat zone.   \n \nIraq3 \n \nIn 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power \nin Iraq. Following the swift invasion and successful removal from power, the United \nStates endeavored to set a solid foundation of democratic institutions in Iraq. The \n \n3The facts in the section concerning Iraq are from Department Counsel\u2019s factual summary, except \nfor some comments about the relationship between the United States and Iraq, which are from the U.S. \nDepartment of State, Background Note: Iraq, Feb. 2008 (AN I, enclosure I) and U.S. Department of State, \nCountry Specific Information: Iraq, Oct. 22, 2008 (AN I, enclosure III). \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nConstitution in Iraq was ratified on October 15, 2005. After free elections in 2005, Iraq's \nnew government, a parliamentary democracy, took office in March 2006.  \n \nIn 2007, 92% of Iraq\u2019s exports were in crude oil and crude oil materials. Almost \nhalf of Iraq\u2019s exports went to the United States. The U.S.\u2019 ultimate goal in Iraq is to \nestablish a peaceful, united, stable, democratic, and secure nation that will be an ally of \nthe United States in the war against terrorism. The United States has invested \nthousands of lives and billions of dollars to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq. Success \nin Iraq is a high national priority of the United States. \n \nDespite the elections and new government, Baghdad, Mosul and several other \nareas have especially serious problems with violent terrorists and insurgents. Although \nthere have been recent improvements in the security environment, Iraq remains \ndangerous, volatile and unpredictable. Although some areas of Iraq are more peaceful \nand less susceptible to terrorist attacks than others, all areas of the country are still very \ndangerous. Terrorists have the ability to strike most areas of the country with explosive \ndevices and mines. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the United States \nArmed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with U.S. and \nIraqi aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq \nremains very high. Terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities as effectively as \nstate intelligence services. \n       \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is the relevant security concerns with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nApplicant, his spouse and his mother, all live in the same household, and all \nthree of them were born in Iraq. Applicant was educated through completion of his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in Iraq. He briefly served in Iraq\u2019s Air Force before deserting prior to \nthe U.S. attack in the first Gulf War. His mother has a U.S. green card, but is still a \ncitizen of Iraq. Applicant traveled to Kurdistan-Iraq in April 2000, September 2002, \nMarch 2005, and November 2006. Although Applicant\u2019s communications with family \nmembers living in Iraq, are not particularly frequent, his spouse and his mother do have \nfrequent, non-casual communications with family members living in Iraq. \u201c[T]here is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the \nimmediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 \nDOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has not rebutted this \npresumption. Applicant\u2019s relationship through his spouse and mother and through them \nwith family living in Iraq is sufficient to create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d Applicant\u2019s relationship with his \nspouse and mother creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help\u201d his \nfamily living in Iraq. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with his spouse and his mother, is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if he has a close \nrelationship with even one relative, who has a relationship with other family members \nliving in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See \nGenerally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Iraq with the United States, places a significant, but not insurmountable \nburden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with his spouse \nand mother, who have relationships with family living in Iraq do not pose a security risk. \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist family living in Iraq.4  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his family, \nnevertheless, his relationship with his spouse and his mother creates a potential conflict \nof interest because his relationship with them is sufficiently close to raise a security \nconcern about his desire to assist family members in Iraq by providing sensitive or \nclassified information. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his spouse and mother and their relationship with family \nmembers living in Iraq to raise the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(d) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about \npotential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n \n4 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in Iraq. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating \nan applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents \nand siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR Case No. 07-\n12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (listing numerous recent cases involving U.S. citizens with Iranian \nconnections whose clearances were denied, and citing no recent cases where the Appeal Board affirmed \nthe grant of a clearance for someone with immediate family members living in Iran). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies; however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(c), 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply \nbecause the U.S. government has not encouraged Applicant\u2019s involvement with family \nmembers living in Iraq. Applicant traveled to Kurdistan-Iraq and visited his family in April \n2000, September 2002, March 2005, and November 2006. Applicant has frequent \ncontact with his spouse and mother, and they have frequent contacts with family \nmembers living in Iraq. AG \u00b6 8(a) has some partial applicability because it is his spouse \nand mother, and not Applicant, who have the extensive contacts with family in Iraq. \nBecause of his spouse and mother\u2019s connections to Iraq, Applicant is not able to fully \nmeet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [her relationships with his \nrelatives who are Iraq citizens] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has established that \n\u201c[he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d In \n1996, the United States gave Applicant and his spouse sanctuary when they fled \nSaddam Hussein\u2019s persecution. In 2004, Applicant and his spouse became U.S. \ncitizens. Their three children are U.S. citizens. Applicant and his spouse have \nsubstantial U.S. property and investments, and they do not have any property or \ninvestments in Iraq. Most importantly, he has served in Iraq in 2007 and 2008 with U.S. \narmed forces in a combat zone.  He has shown his patriotism, loyalty and fidelity to the \nUnited States.   \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with his spouse and mother and \nthrough them with their families in Iraq. His spouse and mother frequently communicate \nwith his family living in Iraq. There is no evidence; however, that terrorists, criminals, the \nIraqi government, or those conducting espionage have approached or threatened \nApplicant or that Iraqi officials have asked Applicant or his family for classified or \nsensitive information. As such, there is a reduced possibility that Applicant or \nApplicant\u2019s family would be targets for improper Iraqi coercion or exploitation. While the \ngovernment does not have any burden to prove the presence of such evidence, if such \nrecord evidence was present, Applicant would have a very heavy evidentiary burden to \novercome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns.   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies because Applicant has no interest in property or bank \naccounts in Iraq. This mitigating condition can only fully mitigate AG \u00b6 7(e), which \nprovides, \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections through his spouse and mother to family living in \nIraq are less significant than his strong connections to the United States. His \nconnections to the United States taken together are sufficient to fully overcome the \nforeign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under this guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere are some facts supporting a foreign influence security concern because of \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Iraq. Applicant, his spouse and his mother, all live in the \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nsame household, and all three of them were born in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s mother is still a \ncitizen of Iraq. He traveled to Kurdistan-Iraq and visited his family in April 2000, \nSeptember 2002, March 2005, and November 2006. He primarily visited his mother, \nwho moved to the United States in 2007. His spouse and mother have frequent \ncommunications with family members living in Iraq. Applicant was educated through \ncompletion of his bachelor\u2019s degree in Iraq. He briefly served in Iraq\u2019s Air Force.  \n  \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Iraq, as well as the dangers existing in Iraq.5 Iraq is a very \ndangerous place because of violence from insurgents and terrorists. Insurgents and \nterrorists continue to threaten the government of Iraq, the interests of the United States, \nU.S. armed forces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. Applicant \nrecognizes his work with the U.S. military forces endangers his family living in Iraq. The \nUnited States and Iraq are allies in the war on terrorism and the United States is \ncommitted to the establishment of a free and independent government in Iraq. Iraq and \nthe United States have close relationships in diplomacy and trade.      \n \nThe circumstances tending to support approval of a clearance for Applicant are \nmore significant. In 1996, Applicant and his spouse fled Iraq and settled in the United \nStates with U.S. State Department assistance. In 2004, Applicant and his spouse \nbecame U.S. citizens. Their three children are U.S. citizens. Applicant returned to Iraq in \n2007 and 2008, serving with U.S. combat forces as a translator. He volunteered to \nreturn to Iraq to continue his translator duties. Reliable military personnel serving with \nhim in Iraq laud his duty performance and contributions to mission accomplishment. He \nis 42 years old. He is mature and responsible. He has significantly greater contacts or \nconnections with the United States than with Iraq. He has infrequent direct contacts with \nhis relatives living in Iraq. He does not own property in Iraq. He and his spouse are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens and swore allegiance to the United States. He has often put \nhimself in harm\u2019s way in 2007 and 2008, working alongside U.S. armed forces in \nnumerous operations. He has made significant contributions to national security, fully \naware of the risks to himself and his family. He strongly wants to return to his duties with \nU.S. troops. All these circumstances demonstrate that Applicant will recognize, resist, \nand report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group at \ncoercion or exploitation. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). \nApplicant\u2019s strong connections to the United States and especially to his U.S. family, \ncommunity and especially his employment as a translator in a combat zone establish \n\u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d See Discussion \nof AG \u00b6 8(b), supra at pages 9-10. \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of her connections to Iraq and to the United States, \nand all the facts in this decision, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of \nmitigating the foreign influence security concerns. \n \n \n5 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.b. He is a 23-year-old systems administrator employed by a defense contractor since July 2008. He has not previously held a clearance. Applicant has a history of excessive alcohol consumption, punctuated by three alcohol-related incidents between October 2003 and October 2007. The most recent incident, an October 2007 DUI (.10 % B.A.C.) arrest that was still pending when the SOR was drafted, was resolved 27 June 2008. Two charges of DUI were dismissed before trial. A third DUI charge and an unsafe lane change charge were nolle prossed the day of trial. Applicant pleaded to, and was found guilty of, negligent driving. He paid fines and court costs of $160. The judge\u2019s findings of fact specifically found Applicant to have not refused a proffered blood alcohol content test. A breathalyzer test given at the scene of the accident caused by Applicant registered .10 % B.A.C. He was observed by witnesses in the other two cars involved in the accident to be throwing beer cans out of his car before the police arrived.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 17 June 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nG, H, and J.  Applicant answered the SOR 7 July 2008, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 28 July 2008, and I convened a hearing 26 August\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 4 September 2008.\n \nSeptember 26, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.b. He is a 23-year-old\nsystems administrator employed by a defense contractor since July 2008. He has not\npreviously held a clearance.\nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol consumption, punctuated by three\nalcohol-related incidents between October 2003 and October 2007. The most recent\nincident, an October 2007 DUI (.10 % B.A.C.) arrest that was still pending when the\nSOR was drafted, was resolved 27 June 2008. Two charges of DUI were dismissed\nbefore trial. A third DUI charge and an unsafe lane change charge were nolle prossed\nthe day of trial. Applicant pleaded to, and was found guilty of, negligent driving. He paid\nfines and court costs of $160. The judge\u2019s findings of fact specifically found Applicant to\nhave not refused a proffered blood alcohol content test. A breathalyzer test given at the\nscene of the accident caused by Applicant registered .10 % B.A.C. He was observed by\nwitnesses in the other two cars involved in the accident to be throwing beer cans out of\nhis car before the police arrived.\nApplicant\u2019s other alcohol incidents include an October 2003 (age 18) drunk in\npublic/underage possession of alcohol offense in which he had a .16 % B.A.C., and a\nJune 2006 DUI offense in which he tested .15 % and .16 % B.A.C. The pertinent portion\nof this latter offense was a period of alcohol abstention and probation that expired in\nAugust 2007.\nAs a result of his October 2007 arrest, in early January 2008, Applicant was\nevaluated at a recognized alcohol treatment program recommended to him by his\nattorney. He was diagnosed with alcohol abuse, and recommended to attend a 48-week\naftercare program, two AA/NA meetings per week, and obtain a sponsor and\nhomegroup within 90 days.  Later in January 2008, he was evaluated at a recognized\nalcohol treatment program closer to where he lived, and again diagnosed with alcohol\nabuse. However, he was not recommended for further counseling as the counselor was\nsatisfied that he had learned his lesson about drinking and driving. Applicant claims that\nhe now drinks 1-3 drinks at a sitting no more than five times per month. He never drinks\nand drives.\nApplicant also has a history of drug abuse. He use marijuana frequently from\nJanuary 2000 to June 2006, and used prescription painkillers about ten times between\nJanuary 2000 and May 2004. After his drunk in public arrest in October 2003, a body\nsearch produced a marijuana pipe and a container with marijuana residue. Applicant\u2019s\ndrug abuse occurred while he was at college. He stopped using marijuana in June 2006\nbecause he knew that he would eventually want to apply for a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s employer considers him an honest, hard worker, and he has good\nwork evaluations. He has not been observed to be under the influence of alcohol or\ndrugs at work. He is engaged to be married, and he and his fianc\u00e9 are trying to buy a\nhome.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b622.(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\n3\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; . . . (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent; (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who\nis a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program;\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nG (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Drug Involvement),  and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline G, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, punctuated by three alcohol-related\narrests between October 2003 and October 2007, and his subsequent diagnoses with\nalcohol abuse in January 2008.  Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns.\n3\n\n\u00b623.(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\n4\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u00b623.(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\n5\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent)\nor responsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\u00b623.(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has\n6\nno history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress;\n\u00b623.(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along\n7\nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, . . . and has received a favorable prognosis by\na duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program.\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse. . .; (c) illegal drug possession, including. . . purchase. . . ;\n8\n\u00b626.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n9\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b626.(b). a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as; . . . (3) an appropriate period\n10\nof abstinence;\n4\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions under Guideline G. His alcohol\nabuse was recent, frequent, and not under unusual circumstances.  Beyond the vaguest\n4\nacknowledgment of past mistakes with alcohol, Applicant has not acknowledged his\nobvious alcohol abuse. Although he was not recommended for further counseling,\nApplicant is unable to point to any other actions taken to overcome the problem. On this\nrecord, Applicant is unable to establish either a pattern of abstinence or responsible use\ngiven that his most recent charges were only resolved in June 2008.  Without some kind\n5\nof program, he cannot demonstrate progress in ensuring responsible drinking in the\nfuture.  Finally, Applicant lacks the kind of program, track record, and prognosis that\n6\nwould demonstrate that his alcohol problems are behind him.  It is too early to conclude\n7\nApplicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline G\nagainst Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H.8\nHowever, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. Although Applicant\u2019s drug abuse\nwas frequent during the periods he used drugs, the circumstances of that use and his\ntwo years abstinence from drug use, suggest he is unlikely to use drugs in the future.9\nWith no indication of any psychological or physical dependence on drugs, his two year\nabstinence from drug use is adequate to demonstrate an intent to refrain from drug use\nin the future.  I conclude Applicant is unlikely to use illegal drugs in the future.\n10\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant.\n\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n11\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n5\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J by\nestablishing Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct and his illegal use of drugs.11\nHowever, the gravamen of the security concerns in this case revolve around Applicant\u2019s\nalcohol abuse issues. Separate allegation of the criminal nature of his conduct, whether\nalcohol abuse or drug abuse, adds nothing of substance to the analysis of Applicant\u2019s\nfitness for access to classified information. I resolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-\nQIP) on September 13, 2005. On July 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 21, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on February 13, 2009. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on February 18, \n2009.  Applicant received the FORM on February 27, 2009. He had 30 days to submit a \nresponse to the FORM. He did not submit a response. On April 23, 2009, the FORM \nwas forwarded to the hearing office. The FORM was assigned to me on April 27, 2009. \n May 4, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.l. \nHe denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.m. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant is a 71-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as a program manager with the \ndefense contractor since January 2005. He is married and has three adult children. \n(Item 4)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts:  \na $23,000 delinquent credit card account placed for collection in October 2002 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a: Item 7 at 2); a $3,045 account placed for collection in May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 7 \nat 2); a $1,327 credit card account placed for collection in January 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: \nItem 7 at 2; Item 8 at 2); a $6,818 credit card account that was charged off in January \n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 7 at 1; Item 8 at 1, 3; Item 9 at 5); a $7,156 credit card account \nthat was charged off in February 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 7 at 2; Item 9 at 5); a $13,000 \naccount placed for collection in April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a $50,000 account placed for \ncollection in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 2); a $8,554 credit card \naccount that was charged off in February 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 2; Item \n9 at 4); a $10,563 account placed for collection in February 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Item 7 at \n2; Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 4); a $4,352 credit card account charged off in February 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j: Item 8 at 1; Item 9 at 5); a $13,218 account placed for collection in February \n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Item 8 at 2). \n \nIn February 2005, one of Applicant\u2019s homes was foreclosed. The mortgage \namount was $456,996. The home was sold in September 2005 and the debt was \nsettled. (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Item 6).   \n \nThere is no record evidence supporting the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. I find for \nApplicant with respect to that allegation.  \n \nApplicant encountered financial problems after he was fired from a well paying \njob in April 2003. He was the president of the company. He was unemployed for one \nyear. He is now gainfully employed and is meeting his current expenses. He states he \nhas no means to pay off his older debts. He denies the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n(Items 5 and 6; Answer to SOR)  On April 10, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an \ninvestigator in conjunction with his background investigation. During the interview, they \nreviewed Applicant\u2019s monthly budget. His total net monthly income was $7,035. His total \nnet monthly expenses were $4,948. After expenses, he had $2,087 left over.  He stated \nhis debts were too massive to pay off each creditor. (Item 6) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that he has two additional \nmonthly expenses totaling $1,367. After expenses, he has approximately $720 left over \neach month. Applicant states that he lives within his means. He stated that he does not \ngenerate enough income to repay his delinquent debts. (Item 2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Between 2002 and 2008, Applicant \nincurred 11 delinquent debts, totaling $128,033. He also had a home foreclosure in \nFebruary 2005.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant continued to incur delinquent accounts as recently as May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nNone of the delinquent accounts have been resolved. Applicant claims he is incapable \nof resolving these delinquent accounts even though he has more than $700 left over \nafter expenses each month.     \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant was fired from a  \njob in April 2003 which caused a substantial strain on his finances. However, he took no \nsteps to resolve his delinquent accounts after becoming employed full-time in 2004.  \nThis mitigating condition is given less weight considering his failure to take steps to \nresolve his delinquent accounts. He has not acted responsibly under the circumstances.    \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling. He has not taken steps to resolve his delinquent accounts. Financial \ncounseling could have assisted Applicant in determining the best approach to resolve \nthese accounts either through repayment or possibly bankruptcy.  Although he states he \nis capable of paying his recent financial accounts, his delinquent accounts remain \nunresolved. His financial situation is unlikely to be resolved soon. \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant took no action towards \nresolving his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) potentially applies with respect to the $23,000 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \nApplicant disputes this debt. However, he provided no evidence that he is taking action \nto formally dispute this debt. There is insufficient proof to apply FC MC \u00b620(e).  \n \nAlthough Applicant has been employed since 2004, he took no action towards \nresolving his delinquent accounts. He claims he does not have the means to repay his \nolder accounts. His failure to take steps to resolve his delinquent accounts remains a \nsecurity concern. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a significant amount \nof unresolved delinquent debt. Although his financial problems were aggravated by his \nemployment termination in 2003, his failure to address his delinquent debts remains a \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsecurity concern. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to the Executive\nOrder and Directive, this case is adjudicated under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining\nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December\n29, 2005.

Price, Esq.  \n                             \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order,\nDoD Directive, and Revised Guidelines,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on July 3, 2008. The SOR is\nJanuary 9, 2009\n\n2\nequivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action.\nThe issues in this case fall under Guideline C for foreign preference and Guideline B for\nforeign influence. \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on August 11, 2008,\nand he requested a hearing. It took place as scheduled pursuant to written notice on\nNovember 20, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received November 26, 2008. For the\nreasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant may have acted in a way to indicate a\npreference for Nigeria over the United States by exercising dual citizenship. Also, the\nSOR alleged Applicant may be subject to foreign influence due to his family ties or\nconnections to Nigeria. In his Answer, Applicant admitted, with explanations, the factual\nallegations in SOR. In addition, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old engineer employed by a federal contractor. He has\nworked for this company since January 2006. This is the first time he has applied for a\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen. He was born to Nigerian parents who\nwere then in the U.S. because his father was a university student. The family departed\nthe U.S. about two years later and lived in the United Kingdom for a short period. The\nfamily then returned to Nigeria where Applicant was raised and educated until 1988\nwhen he decided to leave Nigeria. Applicant explained his decision to come to the U.S.\nas follows:\nI went to the U.S. embassy to ask them questions about coming to the\nUnited States. And they told me at that time that I could, and within a few\nmonths, I got a passport, and to be honest with you, I wanted to leave\nNigeria anyway, so I bought a one-way ticket and came to American and\nnever planned to go back (Tr. 91). \nApplicant traveled to the U.S. in 1988 using a U.S. passport, and he has since used a\nU.S. passport for all foreign travel. \nHe had been a university student in Nigeria during 1986\u20131988. He resumed his\nstudies in the U.S. and was a student during 1988\u20131994. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree\nin electronics engineering technology (BSEET) from an institute of technology. He has\nsince worked in his profession for a series of companies. His current job title is principal\nsystems engineer working in the area of future combat systems (FCS). His annual\nsalary is about $85,000. With a performance bonus and award fees, his total annual\nincome could be up to $100,000. He is a productive, successful, and valued employee\nwho has a good reputation in his company (See Exhibits B and C and relevant witness\n\n3\ntestimony). His on-the-job training includes the completion of security courses in the\nsubjects of OPSEC in 2007 and COMSEC in 2008 (Exhibit B, parts 6 and 7). Applicant\u2019s\nemployment history does not include military service, but he did register with the U.S.\nSelective Service (Exhibit 1).\nApplicant met his future wife, who is a native-born U.S. citizen, in 1993 at church.\nThey married in 1994, and they have two school-aged children. His wife has a college\ndegree in business management, and she is currently working as a night auditor in the\nIT department of a financial firm. She has had limited contact and interaction with\nApplicant\u2019s family members in Nigeria. None of Applicant\u2019s family from Nigeria attended\nthe wedding in 1994, and she did not meet any of them until 2004 when she, along with\nApplicant and the children, traveled to Nigeria. \nApplicant\u2019s December 2004 trip to Nigeria is the first and only time he has\nreturned to Nigeria since departing there in 1988. For the trip, he used a U.S. passport\nafter he obtained a visa from the Nigerian Embassy in the U.S. He made the trip for two\nreasons: (1) he had recently learned that his grandfather was dying; and (2) he wanted\nhis wife and children to visit his family in Nigeria as they had never met (Tr. 94). The trip\nwas for about two weeks and spilled over into January 2005. While there, he decided to\nobtain a Nigerian passport, as he had never had one before. He obtained the passport\nfor two reasons: (1) he thought future travel would be easier (no visa requirement)\nshould he need to travel for a family emergency; and (2) he thought it would facilitate\ninheritance should his father pass away. The Nigeria passport was issued to him on\nJanuary 4, 2005, but he used his U.S. passport to depart Nigeria and enter the U.S. on\nthe return trip. \nApplicant was not working for his current employer when he traveled to Nigeria\nand obtained the passport in 2004. Since applying for a security clearance in 2007\n(Exhibit 1), and being made aware of the security significance of dual citizenship and a\nforeign passport, Applicant took action to address the concerns. He first delivered his\nNigerian passport to DOHA, but the agency returned it to him (Exhibit A, part 3). Then in\nNovember 2008, Applicant completed and submitted the necessary paperwork to\nrenounce his Nigerian citizenship (Exhibit A, parts 1, 2, and 5). Along with the\nrenunciation application, he submitted his Nigerian passport, which he had defaced (Tr.\n121\u2013122; Exhibit A, part 4). Renouncing his Nigerian citizenship was not a difficult\ndecision for Applicant (Tr. 113). \nApplicant has multiple family members who are citizens of and residents in\nNigeria. Applicant has three siblings, an older sister and two younger brothers. His three\nsiblings were born in Nigeria where they reside today. None of his siblings have been\nemployed by the Nigerian government or served in the military. None of his siblings\nwork in a capacity related to the U.S. defense industry. As the eldest son, Applicant\nunderstood that he stood to inherit his father\u2019s estate, which he estimated its value at\nless than U.S. $50,000 (Tr. 97). Since applying to renounce his citizenship, Applicant\nnow understands he will no longer inherit his father\u2019s estate (Tr. 122\u2013123), and he has\nnotified the next oldest brother.  \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n2\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n3\n4\nApplicant\u2019s mother, who divorced his father some years ago, recently immigrated\nto the U.S. Applicant served as her sponsor for immigration purposes. She moved into\nApplicant\u2019s household in 2008 and she has permanent resident alien status (Exhibit A,\npart 6). She is now attending school to become a medical assistant so she can become\nself-sufficient (Tr. 87\u201388). Applicant\u2019s father worked in the brewery industry for many\nyears, he is self-supporting, and he is now essentially retired (Tr. 88).\nAfter the divorce, Applicant\u2019s father married a series of five women. The multiple\nmarriages produced multiple children (Tr. 84). Applicant has had little contact with his\nhalf-siblings and the contact, aside from the 2004 trip, is limited to e-mail (Tr. 85). The\nmost frequent e-mail contact is about once every two to three months with one of the\nhalf-siblings.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother remarried after the divorce and had three more sons, two of\nwhom passed away. The third is a citizen and resident of Nigeria. He is 31 years old\nand Applicant has limited contact with him (Tr. 84). Their relationship is strained as\nApplicant has declined to help him financially. \nApplicant has no business, financial, or property interests in Nigeria. Other than a\nbank account he established during the 2004 trip, his financial affairs are all in the U.S.\nHe opened the bank account for the benefit of his mother to pay expenses associated\nwith immigrating to the U.S. Applicant believes the account now has a balance of about\n$20.\nAdministrative notice is taken of certain facts about Nigeria as described in the\ngovernment\u2019s written request (Appellant Exhibit I). In summary, the government of\nNigeria has been relatively unstable since gaining independence from Britain in 1960 as\nreflected by military rule for approximately 28 years since independence, although\nNigeria returned to civilian rule in 1999. The Nigerian government\u2019s human-rights record\nis poor and it continues to commit serious abuses. The U.S. State Department has\nwarned U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel in Nigeria and of the difficult security\nsituation in the oil rich Niger Delta region of the country. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.2\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n3\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n11\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n12\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n4\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n5\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n7\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n8\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n9\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.10\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n12\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at 7\u20138 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n13\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 7. \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 7. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 7\u20138. \n16\n MC 2 is \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d\n17\n MC 5 is \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n18\ninvalidated.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 5\u20136 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n19\nconditions). \n6\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline C for foreign preference,  a security concern may arise \u201c[w]hen\n13\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d14\nThe most pertinent disqualifying condition here is DC 1, which provides that a\nsecurity concern may exist and be disqualifying based on the \u201cexercise of any right,\nprivilege, or obligation or foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through\nforeign citizenship of a family member.\u201d  DC 1 applies to Applicant based on his active\n15\nexercise of Nigerian citizenship by obtaining a Nigerian passport in 2004 and\npossessing it until 2008. The fact that he did not use the passport for travel is irrelevant,\nas the actions of obtaining and possessing it raise security concerns within the meaning\nof the guideline.  \nThe guideline also contains conditions that may mitigate the security concern.  I\n16\nreviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude that two apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nFirst, MC 2 applies because Applicant completed and submitted the necessary\npaperwork to renounce his Nigerian citizenship.  Although he has not yet received a\n17\nresponse to his renunciation application, Applicant went beyond what is required by MC\n2, which only requires an expression of willingness to renounce. In doing so, Applicant\nhas likely negated any right to inherit property from his father, which is a circumstance\nfull of possibilities (for example, there may be nothing to inherit or Applicant may\npredecease his father or some other contingency). Second, MC 5 applies because\nApplicant defaced his Nigerian passport and returned it to the Nigerian government.18\nTaken together, his actions reflect his true intent and preference  and are more than\nsufficient to overcome the security concerns under Guideline C. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,  security concerns may arise due to\n19\nforeign contacts and interests \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\n\n Revised Guidelines at  5. \n20\n Revised Guidelines at 5. \n21\n See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n22\n2001).\n Revised Guidelines at 6. \n23\n7\ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization,\nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest.\u201d  There are two disqualifying conditions  that could\n20\n21\nraise security concerns and may be disqualifying in this case:\nDC 1. [C]ontact with a foreign family member, business, or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nDC 2. [C]onnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing\nthat information. \nOf course, the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is\nnot\u2014as a matter of law\u2014disqualifying under Guideline B. But if only one relative resides\nin a foreign country and an applicant has contact with that relative, this factor alone is\nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the\ncompromise of classified information.22\nHere, the two disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant has contacts with\nand connections to his family members in Nigeria. He comes from a large family, most\nof whom live in Nigeria. He has ties of affection or emotion to his father, sister, and two\nbrothers. As the eldest son, he probably feels a sense of obligation to these people.\nThese circumstances create the potential for a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of his ties to immediate family\nmembers in Nigeria. His ties to extended family members (the half-siblings) are not\nnearly so strong and any security concerns stemming from these ties are minimal or\nmarginal or both.  \nThree of the six mitigating conditions  under the guideline may apply to the facts\n23\nand circumstances of this case:\nMC 1.  [T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n24\n Revised Guidelines at 5.\n25\n8\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\nMC 2.  [T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\nMC 3.  [C]ontact or communications with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe first and third MC do not apply because Applicant\u2019s relationships with his\nnuclear-family members in Nigeria are of sufficient magnitude or strength to negate\nthese two MCs. In the post-9/11 world, there is at least a remote or slight possibility that\ndangerous elements within Nigeria could attempt to use his family members to coerce\nor pressure Applicant.\nBut the second MC applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. The record evidence supports a\nconclusion that Applicant has a depth of loyalty to the U.S., so that he can be expected\nto resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen\nby virtue of his parents\u2019 temporary residence in the U.S.; however, he demonstrated his\nloyalty to the U.S. by leaving Nigeria and his family in 1988 with a one-way ticket. Since\nthen, he has completed his education and worked in his profession as a systems\nengineer for U.S. companies. In addition, he is married to a native-born U.S. citizen and\nthey have two children who were born here. And, not to be overlooked, is Applicant\u2019s\nmother with whom he has strong ties of affection and obligation. She is now living with\nhim because he sponsored her immigration to the U.S. Taken together, these\ncircumstances show that Applicant\u2019s strongest family ties are to the U.S. and also\ndemonstrate the depth of his commitment to the U.S.\n \nTo sum up under the whole-person concept,  this is not a case of \u201cdivided\n24\nloyalties\u201d  with an applicant who has one foot in the U.S. and one foot in his native\n25\ncountry. On the contrary, the evidence shows Applicant has both feet firmly rooted in\nthe U.S. and that he has significant contacts and ties to the U.S. Applicant, a dual\ncitizen by birth, has made the U.S. his home by choice. Looking forward, it is highly\nunlikely that Applicant will change course. Taken together, these circumstances, along\nwith the highly favorable character evidence (See Exhibit C and relevant witness\ntestimony), support a conclusion that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential\n\n9\nforeign influence or pressure by either coercive or non-coercive means in favor of the\nU.S. interest. \nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant did present sufficient\nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is\ndecided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.   \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 5, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 8, 2008. Applicant filed a\nresponse to the FORM on October 15, 2008. The case was assigned to me on October\n23, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant is indebted to The Flamborough Group in the approximate amount of\n$507.00 as a result of a judgment entered against him in 2000 for non-payment of rent.\nIn his responses to the SOR and FORM, applicant stated he hired a lawyer to get the\njudgment set aside but the lawyer did nothing but tell him lies. In his response to the\nSOR, he said because he \u201cjust want[s] this matter to be solved,\u201d he will satisfy the\n$507.00 debt by making two payments, the first in August 2008 and the second in\nSeptember 2008. In his response to the FORM, he stated he will satisfy this debt by\nmaking two payments, the first in October 2008 and the second in November 2008.\nApplicant has six defaulted student loan debts totaling approximately $8,798.00.\nThese debts have been delinquent for over five years. In his response to the SOR,\napplicant stated all of these debts were consolidated and that he and the creditor\nagreed he would make monthly payments of $105.00 to the creditor beginning June 15,\n2008. In response to the FORM, he reiterated that he had an agreement with the\ncreditor to pay $105.00 a month, and added that he has made eight payments to date.\nAs proof, he attached a copy of a bank debit in the amount of $105.00 dated August 26,\n2008 and an October letter from the creditor reminding him that his post dated check\nwill be deposited later that month. Since only five months had elapsed from the time of\nthe due date of the first payment and the time he responded to the FORM, it is difficult\nto accept his statement that he made eight payments. Although it is possible he made\nadditional payments not required by the repayment agreement, in all likelihood if he had\ndone so he would have stated so. Adding doubts to applicant\u2019s statements is the fact he\nprovided no documentary evidence of a loan consolidation or repayment agreement.\nTwo credit reports in the FORM indicate applicant is indebted to Dealers\nFinancial for a car loan in the approximate amount of $3,465.14.

In response to the FORM, he stated he satisfied the\ndebt in October 2008, but provided no proof.\nApplicant is indebted to Southwestern Bell in the approximate amount of\n$586.00. This debt was referred to Portfolio for collection in 2002. In his response to the\nSOR, applicant stated he settled this debt for $409.00 and will make the required\npayment in February 2009.\nApplicant is indebted to LVNV Funding in the approximate amount of $2,387.00.\nThis debt originated from Sears and was referred to LVNV Funding for collection. The\naccount was then transferred to Allied. In his responses to the SOR and FORM,\napplicant stated he accepted an offer from Allied to settle the debt for $635.00, and will\nmake the payment on October 17, 2008. He attached to his response to the FORM a\n\n3\ncopy of a letter from Allied offering to settle the debt for $635.33. Since the letter is\ndated April 11, 2007 and the offer was contingent on Allied receiving applicant\u2019s\npayment by April 21, 2007, this letter hardly corroborates applicant\u2019s statements. \nApplicant is indebted to MCI in the approximate amount of $244.00. This debt\nwas referred to Park Dansan for collection in 2003. In April 2008, applicant stated he\nplanned on calling Park Dansan \u201cand paying the debt in full\u201d in May 2008.

These\npayments begin in June 15, 2008.\u201d He attached to his response to the FORM a copy of\na letter from the creditor confirming the agreement.\nApplicant is indebted to Vesta in the approximate amount of $325.00. This\naccount is past-due and was referred to Active Coll for collection in 2007. In April 2008,\napplicant stated he planned on contacting the creditor in May 2008 to make payment\n\n4\narrangements.

He provided false material information in response to three\nquestions. In response to Question 23, which in essence asked if applicant had been\n\u201carrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)\u201d during the previous seven\nyears, applicant disclosed a 2005 Contempt of Court charge, but failed to disclose his\nFebruary 2007 charge and conviction for passing a bogus check. In his response to the\nSOR, applicant stated he did not list this offense because he was not arrested. In\nresponse to Questions 28a and 28b on the e-QIP, applicant denied that (1) in the prior\nseven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debt and (2) he was then\nover 90 days delinquent on any debts. In fact, applicant was over 180 days delinquent\non most of the debts discussed above. Applicant\u2019s false answers were clearly\nintentional.\nIn his response to the FORM, applicant stated his financial problems were\ncaused in large part by an improper eviction for nonpayment of rent from his apartment\nin 2000. He stated he lost everything he owned at the time (e.g., furniture, clothes)\nwhen he could not get back into the apartment. He hired an attorney to vacate the\neviction notice, but after four years nothing came of it because his \u201clawyer did not do\nanything but tell [him] lies and let the case sit.\u201d (The landlord in this case was The\nFlamborough Group, which not only successfully evicted applicant, but as noted above,\nalso obtained a judgment against him for unpaid rent).\nApplicant further stated that after the eviction he tried getting his finances back in\norder by getting a job at a paper mill, but after working there about two years, he was\n\u201cwrongfully terminated.\u201d (He stated he sued the company, but provided no further\ninformation.) He further stated that his mother became ill about this time and he paid\nsome of her bills. After looking for employment for four months, he found his current job\nin January 2005.\n\n5\nApplicant provided proof that he completed a money management course in\nMarch 2008. \nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n6\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. Applicant has a long history of conduct indicating an inability or\nunwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his\nfinancial obligations is ongoing. He failed to establish that his financial irresponsibility\nwill not recur. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d In his\nresponse to the FORM, applicant stated his financial delinquencies were caused by an\nimproper eviction, his mother\u2019s illness, and a period of unemployment caused by a\nwrongful termination. As evidenced by the judgment entered against him, applicant\u2019s\neviction was caused by his failure to pay his rent. Thus, this event was not beyond his\ncontrol. His mother\u2019s illness and his period of unemployment may have been factors\nbeyond his control; however, applicant failed to provide sufficient credible evidence to\nestablish he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Accordingly, this mitigating\ncondition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. Because applicant provided proof that he\ncompleted a money management course in 2008, this mitigation condition applies.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition does not apply because, although applicant has made a lot of statements and\nrepresentations about what he has done to address his financial delinquencies, he\nprovided little credible evidence of actually accomplishing anything. And, in light of his\n(1) failure to follow through with his stated intentions to make payments to various\ncreditors (e.g., Arbys, Certergy), and (2) intentional misrepresentations about his\nfinances on the e-QIP, his uncorroborated statements about repayment agreements,\nand what he intends to do to address his financial delinquencies, can be given very little\nweight.\n\n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is clearly applicable.\nI reviewed the potentially mitigating factors under Guideline E and conclude none\napply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple falsifications of material facts on the\ne-QIP, which are felonies under 18 U.S.C. 1001, raise this disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I considered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n8\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na long history of not honoring his financial obligations. Although he provided credible\nevidence that he recently made a few payments to a few of his creditors, most of the\nevidence he provided consisted of uncorroborated statements about repayment\nagreements he reached and what he intends to do in the future. In view of his failure to\nfollow through with earlier promises to pay off certain debts, and his falsification of\nmaterial facts about his financial delinquencies on the e-QIP, his uncorroborated\nstatements are not credible. Based on the foregoing, I conclude applicant failed to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from Guidelines E, F and J.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn July 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 31, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on \nAugust 27, 2008, and reassigned to me on September 9, 2008. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on September 9, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nOctober 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nSeptember 23, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September \n30, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through \nD, which were received without objection. Applicant\u2019s daughter was in the courtroom \nduring the hearing. Applicant did not call her as a witness, but I requested that she \ntestify after I heard Applicant\u2019s testimony. Department Counsel objected to her \ntestimony on the basis that she had not been sequestered and was present during \nApplicant\u2019s testimony. The objection was overruled. The absence of sequestration goes \ntoward the weight that is accorded her testimony. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open to submit additional matters. Applicant submitted one document \nmarked AE E, and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is marked \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She attended \ncollege classes but has not obtained a degree. She has been married and divorced four \ntimes. She is not currently married. She has an adult daughter and a 12-year-old \ngrandson who live with her.1  \n \n \nApplicant is a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser. She started drinking alcohol \nwhen she was about 13 years old. Her alcohol consumption increased until she was \ndrinking heavily three to four times per week. She first smoked marijuana in about 1976, \nwhen she was about 23. She started smoking marijuana about three times per week. In \nabout 1979, when she was about 26, Applicant became involved in a relationship with a \nman whom she later learned was a cocaine dealer. Marijuana and cocaine was readily \navailable and her marijuana use increased to daily use and she began using cocaine \nabout three times per week.2  \n \n \nApplicant terminated her relationship with the drug dealer in about 1981, and she \nalso stopped using cocaine that same year. Her marijuana use continued at the rate of \nabout once per week. She occasionally purchased marijuana when it was not otherwise \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 14, 28, 46-47; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \navailable through her friends. Applicant stopped smoking marijuana in December 1989, \nas her employer initiated a random drug testing program. She continued to drink \nalcohol. She last consumed alcohol in March 1990, on her daughter\u2019s fifteenth birthday. \nWhen she became sober, she changed her friends, where she went, and her lifestyle. \nShe attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings on a daily basis in the 1990s. By \n2004, her attendance at AA meetings was down to about four to six times a year. \nApplicant remained completely sober and drug-free until March 2006.3 \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on January 14, \n2004. She did not have a security clearance at the time. This was her first application. \nShe did not list her drug use that ended in 1989, as it was outside the parameters of the \nquestions. She was interviewed for her background investigation on October 21, 2004. \nShe volunteered that she was a recovering alcoholic. Her drug use was not discussed.4  \n \nApplicant had cancer which was discovered in late 2004, and diagnosed in about \nMarch 2005, after a surgical procedure to remove tissue and a biopsy was performed. \nShe was required to undergo cancer treatment and is still on medication.5  \n \nApplicant has not lived in the state where she lived while she was drinking and \ndoing drugs in more than ten years. In March 2006, she attended a conference in the \nstate where she used to live. She met some old friends that she knew from her job in \nthe 1980s. Applicant used marijuana several times with her friends over the course of \ntwo nights. She smoked on more than one occasion on each night. Applicant does not \nconsider it an excuse and admits that she exhibited extremely poor judgment when she \nsmoked marijuana, but she explained that her cancer was discussed and she was \nemotionally upset. As a result of her marijuana use, Applicant tested positive in March \n2006 for marijuana use during a random drug screening test performed by her \nemployer.6  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance was granted in late March 2006, after she had \nused the marijuana. Even though she did not yet have a clearance, she clearly knew \nthat marijuana use was illegal and against Department of Defense policy. Her company \ndid not terminate her. It suspended her for two days, relocated her, directed that she not \nwork on the program that she was working on, and she was ordered to attend \ncounselling and sign a non-disclosure agreement. Apparently the company considered \nher a valuable asset, but did not want other employees to know that the company \ngranted her lenience on their zero drug policy. She was moved to a different sub-\ndivision of the company in September 2006.7 \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 11, 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n4 Tr. at 24-26, 29; GE 1, 3. \n \n5 Tr. at 20; AE D. \n \n6 Tr. at 33-36, 40, 44-45, 47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n7 Tr. at 24-26, 29-32; GE 3; AE A-C. \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant has been open and honest about her marijuana use since she tested \npositive. Because of the non-disclosure agreement she is unable to discuss it with her \nco-workers, but she has told her daughter and her close friends. She also told her 12-\nyear-old grandson because she thinks that it is important that he remembers what she \nwent through when the time eventually comes that he is offered drugs. She listed the \nmarijuana use on a SF-86 submitted in May 2006. She credibly testified that she listed it \nas one use because she considered it as one event. She fully discussed the drug use \nwith a background investigator in June 2007.8 \n \nApplicant attended counselling through her employee assistance program (EAP) \nfor about nine weeks between April and June 2006. The counselling consisted of 45 \nminute sessions about every other week. She continues to attend AA meetings about \nfour to six times a month. She accepts that her marijuana use was a break in her \nsobriety, the same as if it was alcohol. Because the break in sobriety was relatively \nshort, it is considered more of a \u201cslip\u201d than a \u201crelapse,\u201d although the only real difference \nis duration of the break. She has made one trip to the state where she smoked \nmarijuana in 2006. She did not meet any of her old friends on the trip. She testified that \nshe is totally committed to sobriety, which includes refraining from any illegal drug use. \nShe did not sign a statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation before the hearing. I directed her attention to Drug Involvement Mitigating \nCondition AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), and she provided a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation after the hearing.9 \n \n \nApplicant submitted three letters from managers and supervisors. Two of the \nsupervisors/managers are unaware of her 2006 drug use because of the non-disclosure \nagreement. They have both worked with Applicant since September 2006. One \nsupervisor believes Applicant has consistently demonstrated the highest ethical \nconduct, is an extremely productive member of the workforce, and the supervisor has \nnever observed behavior that would cause him to think she is not trustworthy or \nexercising poor judgment. Another manager wrote that Applicant is extremely detail \noriented and has demonstrated excellent managerial and decision making skills. The \nlast manager is aware of Applicant\u2019s drug history. He has known Applicant since 2003, \nand wrote that she is \u201cof the highest moral and ethical character.\u201d10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 14-15; GE 1, 3. \n \n9 Tr. at 38-40, 45-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE E. \n \n10 AE A-C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \n\n \n6 \n \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;   \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use;  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession, use, and positive drug test are sufficient to raise AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (b), and (c) as disqualifying conditions. She had not yet been granted a \nsecurity clearance when she used marijuana so AG \u00b6 25(g) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 1.e \nalleges that Applicant \u201cattended counseling for [her] drug use.\u201d Counseling is a positive \nreaction to drug abuse and can lead to mitigation. It does not raise a disqualifying \ncondition. SOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant.  \n \nThree Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant is a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser. She stopped taking drugs in \nDecember 1989, and stopped drinking in 1990. She disassociated herself from her \ndrug-using associates and contacts; changed the environment where drugs were used; \nand threw herself into Alcoholics Anonymous. She remained completely sober and \ndrug-free for 16 years. She returned to the state where she used drugs for a business \ntrip in March 2006. She met old friends and smoked marijuana several times over the \ncourse of a few days. Whether defined as a \u201cslip\u201d or a \u201crelapse,\u201d this was a loss of \nsobriety and a huge step backwards for Applicant. She acknowledged her problem, \nattended the company\u2019s EAP counseling, and rededicated herself to sobriety and \nremaining drug-free. She has now been sober and drug-free for about two and a half \nyears. She does not rate the full benefit of AG \u00b6 26(a) because she used illegal drugs in \nMarch 2006, after being drug-free for more than 16 years. She does not live in the state \nwhere she used drugs and she did not meet her old drug-using friends when she again \ntraveled to the state after March 2006. She signed a statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. AG \u00b6 26(b) is applicable. Applicant attended \ndrug counseling through her employee assistance program after her positive drug test. \nAG \u00b6 26(d) requires a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nThere is no such prognosis in this case. AG \u00b6 26(d) is not applicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct was also alleged under the Drug Involvement \nguideline, as addressed above. She used marijuana in March 2006, after submitting a \nsecurity clearance application and being interviewed for her background investigation. \nShe was well aware that drug use was wrong, illegal, and against DoD and her \ncompany\u2019s policy. She exercised extremely poor judgment. This constitutes credible \nadverse information in another adjudicative issue area that may not be sufficient for an \nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as \na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nIt is also personal conduct that could create a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, \nor duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nThe discussion under the guideline for Drug Involvement is equally appropriate \nfor this guideline. Applicant has obtained counseling for the problem and regularly \nattends AA meetings. I find that the behavior is unlikely to recur. Additionally, Applicant \nhas been open and honest about the conduct which has reduced any potential \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 16(e) are \napplicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n9 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 55 years old. She is a \nrecovering alcoholic and drug abuser. She made extensive changes in her life in 1989 \nand 1990, and remained drug and alcohol free for 16 years. Like any recovering \nalcoholic, her struggle against alcohol and drugs is a series of on-going battles. In \nMarch 2006, she lost a battle for her sobriety, and smoked marijuana several times over \nthe course of a few days. This was extremely poor judgment and for security clearance \npurposes is worse than if she drank alcohol, because while alcohol is like poison to her, \nit is legal while marijuana use is illegal. A break in sobriety, whether called a \u201cslip\u201d or a \n\u201crelapse\u201d is not unusual for a recovering alcoholic. She pulled herself together and \nrededicated herself to being sober and drug-free. She has won the battle for the last two \nand a half years and remained sober and drug-free. I have considered the favorable \ncharacter evidence which has limited weight because two of the letter-writers are not \ntotally aware of Applicant\u2019s drug use. The letters are of value in that they show that \nApplicant has maintained superior job performance. Applicant will continue to struggle \nfor her sobriety. She has convinced me that she is on the right track to win that struggle. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her drug use and \npersonal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n4 \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJohn B. Wells, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 20, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n1See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 818 for the jurisdiction of a general court-martial.   \n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On August 18, 2010,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  Department\nCounsel cross-appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.28. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s essential findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge failed to consider significant\nrecord evidence; whether the Government failed to meet its burden of production; whether the Judge\nwas biased against Applicant; whether the Judge failed properly to apply the whole-person factors;\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  Department Counsel raised the following issue on cross-appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable decision under Guideline E was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with\nthe following discussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nFacts\nThe Judge found that Applicant is an employee of a Defense contractor.  He has a Masters\ndegree in public administration.  He served on active duty from 1983 to 2003.  He is married, with\ntwo children from a previous marriage. \nThis case arose from allegations of sexual misconduct against Applicant and two fellow\nofficers in the U.S. military.  The allegations resulted in a general court-martial,1 which will be\ndiscussed below.  The Judge\u2019s findings consist in large measure of summaries of trial testimony and\nof other evidence, including the versions of events provided by Applicant, his two co-accuseds, and\nthe victim (V).  In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge explained why he found V\u2019s\nversion to be credible and why he found the versions provided by the three accuseds to be lacking\ncredibility in significant ways.  \nApplicant and his two friends, B and C, were, as stated above, military officers.  V was a\nfemale enlisted member of the same branch of service.  She met B in 2000.  Knowing him to be an\nofficer, she nevertheless engaged in sexual activity with him during the summer months.  She\nsubsequently met Applicant and C at a party in January 2001.  She and Applicant danced together,\nand she told Applicant she was enlisted.  Applicant gave her his business card.  She danced with C\nat the same party.  Applicant told V about an upcoming party at an on-base club, in honor of\nApplicant\u2019s transfer to another assignment.  \nV attended the party.  She danced with C, and at some point, observed C speaking with\nApplicant and B.  V did not consume any alcohol at the party.  C invited V to come to his residence,\ntelling her that other partygoers were to arrive soon after.  V agreed, and she and C left the party at\nabout 10:30 p.m.  The drive to C\u2019s residence took about 25 minutes.  \n\n210 U.S.C. \u00a7 920.\n310 U.S.C. \u00a7 925.\n410 U.S.C. \u00a7 933.\n510 U.S.C. \u00a7 907.\n610 U.S.C. \u00a7 881. \n3\nC and V were the first to arrive at his residence.  They engaged in consensual sexual activity.\nThey went to C\u2019s bedroom, where the sexual activity continued.  V heard the front door open, and\nshe requested C to close the bedroom door.  C partially closed the door.  V saw Applicant and B\nwatching through the partially closed bedroom door.  She asked to leave, but Applicant and B entered\nthe bedroom.  B was totally naked, and Applicant had on nothing but a tank top.  The three officers\nengaged in sexual activity with V.  B and C held V\u2019s legs, while Applicant engaged in sexual\nintercourse with her.  After Applicant left the room, B and C forced V to perform oral sex upon C.\nV did not fight back or scream.  She did not incur any physical injuries.  After these events,\nC took V home, stopping on the way at a take-out restaurant.  While C was in the restaurant, V called\na male friend and left a message that \u201csome sh-t\u201d had happened.  When she got back to her room, she\ndid not take a shower.  The next morning, V told her supervisors about the incidents of the previous\nnight.  She was subsequently examined at a rape crisis center, and she provided a statement to law\nenforcement personnel.  \nAs a consequence of V\u2019s complaint, the military service conducted a criminal investigation.\nPursuant to the investigation, V made a pretextual telephone call to C, which was recorded by the\ninvestigators.  Telephone records demonstrate that, after this phone call, Applicant, B, and C\nconducted several conversations among themselves, some as long as nearly 30 minutes.  Applicant\nand his companions later made statements to investigators describing their version of the events in\nquestion.  \nThe three were subsequently brought to a joint trial by general court-martial.  The charged\noffenses included rape,2 forced sodomy,3 conduct unbecoming an officer4 by engaging in wrongful\nand dishonorable sexual activity with an enlisted person in the presence of others, false official\nstatement,5 conspiracy6 to commit certain sexual offenses against V, and conspiracy to make a false\nofficial statement, all offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  The military\njudge found Applicant and his co-accuseds guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer, conspiracy to\nmake a false official statement, and false official statement.  He found them not guilty of the\nremaining charges.  He sentenced the three each to forfeit $500 pay per month for two months and\nto be reprimanded.  In performing his review under Article 69, UCMJ, the Judge Advocate General\n\n7Cases in which a sentence extends to death, dismissal of an officer, dishonorable discharge or bad conduct\ndischarge, or confinement for one year or more are reviewed for legal and factual sufficiency by a service court of\nappeals.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.  Cases in which the sentence is less than that statutory minimum are reviewed by the service\u2019s\nTJAG.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 869.   \n4\n(TJAG) set aside the finding of guilt as to conspiracy, affirmed the remaining findings of guilt, and\napproved the sentences.7  \nThe Government\u2019s case at trial against Applicant and his companions included DNA\nevidence.  This evidence identified Applicant\u2019s and V\u2019s DNA on one of three condoms discovered\nin C\u2019s trash can, corroborating V\u2019s claim that Applicant had sex with her.  This evidence was\nprovided through the testimony of a scientist from a criminal investigation laboratory.  After trial,\nit was discovered that this same scientist had come under investigation for permitting contamination\nduring his testing procedures and for falsifying DNA entries.  These infractions were not connected\nwith the forensic testing done in Applicant\u2019s case.  However, subsequent DNA testing by other\nscientists excluded the three accuseds from two of the condoms and concluded that the results from\nthe third were inconclusive.  In light of this newly discovered evidence, TJAG set aside the remaining\nfindings of guilt, authorizing another trial.\nDiscussion \nFactual Sufficiency: Applicant claims that the Judge\u2019s findings in support of V\u2019s version of\nthe offenses are not based upon substantial record evidence.  Applicant contends that the evidence\nunequivocally demonstrates that, during the criminal investigation and subsequent court-martial, V\nprovided false evidence against Applicant and his companions.  Applicant contends that it was error\nfor the Judge to have accepted V\u2019s credibility in the course of formulating his findings.  \nWe review the Judge\u2019s findings of facts to determine if they are supported by substantial\nevidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis\nis something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent\nconclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being\nsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620\n(1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nThroughout his brief, Applicant points to his acquittal as a reason to discount V\u2019s version of\nthe events.  However, \u201cthe fact that criminal charges were dropped, dismissed, or resulted in an\nacquittal does not preclude an Administrative Judge from finding an applicant engaged in the conduct\nunderlying those criminal charges.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0119 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 1999).  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge explained why he concluded that V was\ncredible.  He stated that the record did not provide a plausible reason for her to have falsely accused\nApplicant and his companions, and he addressed aspects of Applicant\u2019s statement to investigators that\n\n8Verbatim transcriptions of court-martial proceedings are not required in cases in which the sentence does not\ninclude death, a dismissal of a commissioned officer, a punitive discharge, or any other punishment exceeding the\njurisdictional limits of a special court-martial.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 854(c)(1).  For the jurisdictional limits of a special court-\nmartial, see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 819.   \n9Applicant argued that V may have falsely accused the three officers because she was upset at having been\ndiscovered by B, to whom she was attracted, in C\u2019s residence; that she wanted to take down three officers in a \u201ctrifecta;\u201d\nthat she may have been concerned about being charged with fraternization and sought to shift the blame to others; and\nthat she wanted to strike back at B because \u201cshe felt spurned.\u201d  \n10We also note the Judge\u2019s finding concerning C\u2019s statement to the criminal investigator.  Decision at 5.  This\nstatement is described in the trial testimony of the investigator.  C stated to the investigator that, when Applicant and\nB knocked on his bedroom door, V \u201cbecame very upset, flustered, and that he thought she felt as though she was being\nset up or something.\u201d  Item 8, Record of Trial, at 138.  Compare with V\u2019s summarized testimony concerning events\narising from the arrival of Applicant and B at C\u2019s bedroom: \u201cWhen [Applicant] and [B] came into the room, I told them\nI was ready to go home and to take me home, that I didn\u2019t want to do this . . . I was trying to get up because I didn\u2019t want\nto be there.\u201d  Id. at 190.  C\u2019s description of V\u2019s reaction to Applicant and B corroborates her testimony on the subject.\nC\u2019s statement is somewhat inconsistent with the statements Applicant and B provided during the investigation, in that\nneither of them refer to V or to the agitation both she and C describe.  \n5\nhe found were not plausible.  For example, Applicant had stated to investigators that he and B went\nto C\u2019s house on the evening in question in order to check up on C\u2019s well-being after he had left the\nparty without their knowledge.  The Judge concluded that, under the circumstances, it was not\nbelievable that they would have driven for nearly a half hour in order to see if C were alright rather\nthan simply to have called him on the phone.  It was more logical, the Judge concluded, that\nApplicant and B went to C\u2019s house because they expected to have sexual relations with V.  \nWe have considered the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  The File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) consists in large measure of the voluminous record of trial generated by\nthe court-martial.  We have paid particular attention to the summaries of V\u2019s testimony8 and to her\nother statements, as well as to the statements of Applicant and his co-accuseds.  V made several\ninconsistent statements, highlighted at trial.  Furthermore, the record contains evidence that V did not\nenjoy a good reputation for truthfulness.  However, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that V had no obvious motive falsely to implicate three men in criminal conduct.  The\nreasons advanced by Applicant, and summarized by the Judge in Footnote 11 of the Decision, are\nspeculative and do not undermine the Judge\u2019s conclusion about credibility.9  Furthermore, the Judge\u2019s\nfindings about the extensive telephone conversations following the pretextual telephone call support\nhis conclusion that Applicant and his companions conspired among themselves to make false\nstatements about V\u2019s claims.   \nWe also note Department Counsel\u2019s discussion in the FORM and in his reply brief, in which\nhe describes the extent to which V\u2019s version of the events in question is corroborated by other record\nevidence.  For example, the statements of the three officers are generally consistent with that of V\nas to the circumstances leading up to Applicant\u2019s and B\u2019s appearance at C\u2019s house.  Indeed, Applicant\nand his fellow officers, through their own words, place themselves at the scene of the offenses.  C\u2019s\nown acknowledgment that he engaged in sexual activity with V at his house is consistent with a view\nthat Applicant and B went there for a similar purpose.10  Viewed in light of the record as a whole, the\n\n11Prior to referral to a general court-martial, charges against an accused must be investigated regarding the truth\nof the matters underlying the charges and the form of the charges.  The investigating officer is required to make a\nrecommendation as to the appropriate disposition of the case.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 832.  \n12The IO had concluded, among other things, that V\u2019s actions during and following the alleged incident were\nnot consistent with her claim to have been subjected to rape and forcible sodomy.  He stated that she showed no\nresistance during the offense, did not scream or yell, or try to escape.  He also noted that, when C took her to the\nrestaurant after the events in question, she \u201cacted wholly inconsistent with the way a reasonable person would react if\nshe had been assaulted.\u201d  Item 7, Remarks Attached to IO Report, at 6-8.  On the other hand, a forensic psychiatrist, who\ntestified at trial as a prosecution witness, stated that V\u2019s conduct during and following the incident is not unusual among\nvictims of sexual assault.  Item 8, Record of Trial, at 212.  The military judge had commented on V\u2019s demeanor during\ntestifying and that her sometimes cursory answers, such as \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d were not helpful.  Id. at 203.  \n6\nJudge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations\nor inferences that could be drawn from the record, and are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-\n11735 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 2, 2010).  \nApplicant requests that we defer not to the credibility determinations of the Judge but rather\nto that of the Investigating Officer (IO) in the Article 32 investigation,11 who had found V not to be\na credible witness, and to defer as well to certain comments during trial by the military judge.12\nHowever, those officials were examining the case in a criminal law context, with its different\nstandards of proof and evidence.  Furthermore, Applicant decided to have his DOHA case decided\non the written record.  As a result, the Judge did not have an opportunity to question Applicant and\nobserve his demeanor.  Although we have considered the IO\u2019s opinions, along with all the other\nevidence, we do not find in them a reason to reverse the Judge\u2019s analysis and conclusions.\nOther Issues:  Applicant contends that the Judge ignored record evidence of an exculpatory\nnature.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 09-01735 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2010).  In the case under consideration here, the Judge\nmade extensive findings, which included descriptions of the statements by the accuseds, a discussion\nof the problems with the DNA evidence, Applicant\u2019s evidence of good character, and other matters\nfavorable to Applicant.  As explained above, the record as a whole supports the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact.  It provides no reason to believe that the Judge ignored record evidence.  Neither does it provide\na reason to believe that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009). \nIn his brief, Applicant states that the Judge\u2019s \u201copinion was not reasoned.  It was based solely\non a belief that [Applicant] was guilty, despite the overwhelming weight of evidence to the contrary.\u201d\nTo the extent that this raises an issue that the Judge prejudged the case and, therefore, evidenced bias,\nwe note that there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased.  A party seeking\nto overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01306\nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).  Other than his disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record\n\n13At the time of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, \u201cindecent acts with another\u201d was an offense punishable under 10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 934.  Although Applicant was not convicted of this offense, the Judge concluded that it was raised by the record\nevidence.  \n14Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 31(a).  \n15Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 31(c).  \n16See Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), (b), (c), and (d).  \n7\nevidence, Applicant points to nothing in support of his argument on this issue.  Applicant\u2019s brief is\nnot sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge was unbiased.\nApplicant suggests that the offenses, even if they occurred, were not serious enough to\nconstitute Guideline J disqualifying conditions.  He states that, \u201c[w]hile even a one-time instance of\nconsensual drunken debauchery, had it occurred, needs to be discouraged and punished, it does not\nrise to the level of seriousness that requires the loss of clearance eligibility.\u201d  Applicant Brief at 29.\nHowever, the Judge\u2019s findings and analysis established substantial evidence of conduct unbecoming\nan officer, indecent acts with another,13 conspiracy to make false statements, and the making of false\nstatements.  See Decision at 12.  The Judge concluded that the Government had met its burden of\nproduction as to two disqualifying conditions under Guideline J: 31(a)14 (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) and 31(c)15 (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).  This conclusion is\nsustainable. \n  \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his analysis of the mitigating conditions and the\nwhole-person factors.  He notes, for example, that the offenses, even if they occurred, were nearly\nten years old at the time of the Decision and, when viewed in light of Applicant\u2019s excellent traits of\ncharacter, demonstrate rehabilitation.  He argues that Applicant had succeeded in demonstrating his\ninnocence but that, if the offenses occurred, Applicant\u2019s drunken condition would have rendered him\nsusceptible to peer pressure.16  The Judge acknowledged the age of the offenses.  However, the\noverall tenor of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM and subsequent appeal brief was that he did not\ncommit the offenses.  Having reasonably found that he did, however, the Judge did not err in\nconcluding that Applicant\u2019s continued denial of responsibility significantly undercuts his efforts to\ndemonstrate mitigation.  Moreover, the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the\nrequirements of Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2 (a), in that he considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s\nconduct in reaching his decision. See ISCR Case No. 09-01793 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2010).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

    "discussion": ", we affirm the decision of the Judge. Facts The Judge found that Applicant is an employee of a Defense contractor. He has a Masters degree in public administration. He served on active duty from 1983 to 2003. He is married, with two children from a previous marriage. This case arose from allegations of sexual misconduct against Applicant and two fellow officers in the U.S. military. The allegations resulted in a general court-martial,1 which will be discussed below. The Judge\u2019s findings consist in large measure of summaries of trial testimony and of other evidence, including the versions of events provided by Applicant, his two co-accuseds, and the victim (V). In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge explained why he found V\u2019s version to be credible and why he found the versions provided by the three accuseds to be lacking credibility in significant ways. Applicant and his two friends, B and C, were, as stated above, military officers. V was a female enlisted member of the same branch of service. She met B in 2000. Knowing him to be an officer, she nevertheless engaged in sexual activity with him during the summer months. She subsequently met Applicant and C at a party in January 2001. She and Applicant danced together, and she told Applicant she was enlisted. Applicant gave her his business card. She danced with C at the same party. Applicant told V about an upcoming party at an on-base club, in honor of Applicant\u2019s transfer to another assignment. V attended the party. She danced with C, and at some point, observed C speaking with Applicant and B. V did not consume any alcohol at the party. C invited V to come to his residence, telling her that other partygoers were to arrive soon after. V agreed, and she and C left the party at about 10:30 p.m. The drive to C\u2019s residence took about 25 minutes. 210 U.S.C. \u00a7 920. 310 U.S.C. \u00a7 925. 410 U.S.C. \u00a7 933. 510 U.S.C. \u00a7 907. 610 U.S.C. \u00a7 881. 3 C and V were the first to arrive at his residence. They engaged in consensual sexual activity. They went to C\u2019s bedroom, where the sexual activity continued. V heard the front door open, and she requested C to close the bedroom door. C partially closed the door. V saw Applicant and B watching through the partially closed bedroom door. She asked to leave, but Applicant and B entered the bedroom. B was totally naked, and Applicant had on nothing but a tank top. The three officers engaged in sexual activity with V. B and C held V\u2019s legs, while Applicant engaged in sexual intercourse with her. After Applicant left the room, B and C forced V to perform oral sex upon C. V did not fight back or scream. She did not incur any physical injuries. After these events, C took V home, stopping on the way at a take-out restaurant. While C was in the restaurant, V called a male friend and left a message that \u201csome sh-t\u201d had happened. When she got back to her room, she did not take a shower. The next morning, V told her supervisors about the incidents of the previous night. She was subsequently examined at a rape crisis center, and she provided a statement to law enforcement personnel. As a consequence of V\u2019s complaint, the military service conducted a criminal investigation. Pursuant to the investigation, V made a pretextual telephone call to C, which was recorded by the investigators. Telephone records demonstrate that, after this phone call, Applicant, B, and C conducted several conversations among themselves, some as long as nearly 30 minutes. Applicant and his companions later made statements to investigators describing their version of the events in question. The three were subsequently brought to a joint trial by general court-martial. The charged offenses included rape,2 forced sodomy,3 conduct unbecoming an officer4 by engaging in wrongful and dishonorable sexual activity with an enlisted person in the presence of others, false official statement,5 conspiracy6 to commit certain sexual offenses against V, and conspiracy to make a false official statement, all offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The military judge found Applicant and his co-accuseds guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer, conspiracy to make a false official statement, and false official statement. He found them not guilty of the remaining charges. He sentenced the three each to forfeit $500 pay per month for two months and to be reprimanded.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: John B. Wells, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nIn 2001, Applicant, a commissioned officer, and two other officers were involved \nin sexual conduct with an enlisted female. Applicant was convicted at a general court-\nmartial of conspiracy, conduct unbecoming an officer, and false swearing. The Judge \nAdvocate General subsequently set aside Applicant\u2019s convictions and authorized a new \ntrial. Although no new trial is anticipated, there is substantial evidence that Applicant \ncommitted these criminal offenses. He has not taken responsibility, shown remorse, or \notherwise established his rehabilitation. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated; \nhowever, criminal conduct concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 10, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Item 5). On November 20, 2008, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (Item 1), \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nAugust 18, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines J (criminal conduct) and E \n(personal conduct) (Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (Item 1). \n \nOn December 8, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and initially \nrequested a hearing. (Item 4) On November 19, 2009, Applicant\u2019s counsel waived \nApplicant\u2019s right to a hearing and requested a decision on the record (Item 19 at 1). A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated January 6, 2010, was \nprovided to Applicant\u2019s counsel on February 22, 2010, and he was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation.1 On March 12, 2010, Applicant responded to the FORM. On April 29, 2010, \nDepartment Counsel filed a rebuttal to Applicant\u2019s FORM response. The case was \nassigned to me on May 3, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s responses to the SOR and FORM, he admitted that he was \nconvicted at a general court-martial (GCM) in 2001 of conspiracy, conduct unbecoming \nan officer, and false swearing in violation of Articles 81, 133, and 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 881, 933 and 934. The GCM sentenced him to forfeit $500 pay per month for two \nmonths, and a letter of reprimand. However, Applicant has continued to challenge \nwhether there is sufficient evidence to meet the substantial evidence test used for \nsecurity clearance determinations. See Policies section of this decision for burdens of \nproof. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of \nfact.   \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 He was awarded a \nmasters degree in public administration in 1994. He served on active duty from 1983 to \n2003. He was enlisted from 1983 to 1992, and he was an officer from 1992 to 2003.

The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to \nsubmit information (file).  \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s July 10, 2007 SF 86 \n(Item 5). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nmarried in 1991 and divorced in 2005. He married his current spouse in 2006.  His two \nchildren were born in 1993 and 1996.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement, Prosecution Exhibit (PE) 124 \n \nApplicant met H and W, who were the same grade as Applicant (O-3), in July \n1999. Applicant, H, and W were good friends, who often played golf and went to each \nother\u2019s residences for social reasons.  \n \nApplicant met V at a Super Bowl party in January 2001. \u201cThere were numerous \npeople at the party and [he] briefly talked to [V]. [Applicant and V] did not have an in-\ndepth conversation, just one in which we introduced each other.  .  .  . [H] was at the \nparty, but [W] was not.\u201d \n \nApplicant, H, W, and V attended a second party on January 31, 2001, at a club. \nApplicant, H, and W consumed a considerable amount of alcohol at the party. H left the \nparty without telling Applicant he was leaving. W and Applicant \u201cbecame concerned as \nwe knew [H] had a lot to drink. [Applicant and W] drove to [H\u2019s] residence to make sure \n[H] was fine.\u201d W drove to H\u2019s residence even though Applicant and W had been drinking \n\u201cpretty heavily as the night went on.\u201d When Applicant went to H\u2019s residence, they \nnoticed that H\u2019s vehicle was parked at H\u2019s house. H\u2019s front door was unlocked. \nApplicant and W went inside H\u2019s residence, and W went to H\u2019s bedroom door, which \nwas closed. W shouted for H, asking if H was OK. H responded that he was fine. \nApplicant claimed that he did not hear any other voice emanating from H\u2019s room, and he \ndid not see W open H\u2019s bedroom door. Applicant and W immediately left H\u2019s residence. \nW arrived at Applicant\u2019s home between 11 pm and midnight.5 \n \nV\u2019s testimony  \n \nV met W in the summer of 2000. (Tr. 184) She knew he was an officer. (Tr. 184) \nThey talked and danced the first evening that they met. (Tr. 184) She was then 19 years \nold and an active duty enlisted woman (E-3).

This statement is the source for the facts in this section. H, W, \nand Applicant did not testify at their joint court-martial. They have an absolute right not to testify at their \ncourt-martial, and no adverse inference whatsoever is drawn from their decision not to testify.    \n \n \n5 A law enforcement agent indicated it took about 10-15 minutes to drive from H\u2019s residence to \nApplicant\u2019s residence on base.

(Tr. 186-187; PE 4) V also danced with H at the Super \nBowl party. (Tr. 186) Applicant also told her about a party for him on January 31, 2001, \nat a club on base, which was because he was being reassigned. (Tr. 187) \n \nOn January 31, 2001, V went to the party and danced with H. (Tr. 188) V \nobserved H talking to Applicant and W. (Tr. 188) V did not consume any alcohol. (Tr. \n188) H invited V to a party at his residence. (Tr. 187-189) H said there were going to be \na lot of people at the party at H\u2019s house. (Tr. 187-188) H did not appear to be \nintoxicated. (Tr. 188) H and V departed the party about 10:30 pm and drove to H\u2019s \nresidence, which took about 25-30 minutes. (Tr. 188, 201)  \n \nAt first V and H sat on the couch, and V waited for others to arrive at the party. \n(Tr. 188-189) H started kissing and fondling V, with her consent, and then they moved \nfrom the couch to H\u2019s bedroom. (Tr. 188-189) H continued to kiss and fondle V, and he \nkissed her vaginal area. (Tr. 188-189, 202) H\u2019s bedroom door was open, and V heard \nthe front door open. (Tr. 189) V asked H to close the bedroom door and he partially \nclosed it. (Tr. 189) V observed Applicant and W watching through the partially open \nbedroom door. (Tr. 190) She asked to leave. (Tr. 190) Applicant and W entered the \nbedroom. Applicant was only wearing a tank top, and W was naked. (Tr. 190, 206, 207) \nW got into bed with H and V, and H and W fondled V. (Tr. 190) V said they were forcing \nthemselves on her and she told them to stop. (Tr. 190) Applicant engaged in sexual \nintercourse with V for about two minutes while W and H held her legs and encouraged \nApplicant to continue. (Tr. 191, 197-198, 202) She was unsure whether Applicant was \nwearing a condom, or whether he ejaculated. (Tr. 191) After engaging in sexual \nintercourse with V, Applicant left the room and did not return. After Applicant left the \nroom, W and H forced V to perform oral sodomy on H. (Tr. 191-192) Applicant was the \nonly one who had sexual intercourse with V. (Tr. 192) \n \nV did not scratch, punch, kick, bite, or scream because she was scared. (Tr. 198, \n206) She did not incur any physical injuries, such as scratches or bruises. (Tr. 195) On \nthe way back to the base, H took V to a carry out restaurant. (Tr. 193) She saw two \npetty officers at the restaurant; however, she did not talk to them. (Tr. 193) She also \ncalled a male friend and left a message that \u201csome shit\u201d had happened to her, but she \ndid not provide details. (Tr. 193, 195) H dropped her off at her barracks, which was \nabout a 25 minute drive from H\u2019s residence. (Tr. 205) She did not take a shower \nbecause she did not want to wash away evidence. (Tr. 193, 195) She went to sleep, \nand the next morning contacted her supervisors and reported the incident. (Tr. 193-194) \nOn February 1, 2001, she was examined at a rape crisis center, and on February 2, \n2001, she provided a statement to law enforcement. \n \nH\u2019s statement to law enforcement and PE 7 \n \n \nH said on January 31, 2001, he drank two Long Island ice teas at the club from \napproximately 5:00 p.m. until the time that he left the club with V at about 10:30 pm. (Tr. \n139) He said he did not see V drink any alcohol, and he did not provide her with any at \nhis house. Id. H denied that he was intoxicated. Id. H said that when he left the club with \nV, both Applicant and W saw H leave with V. Id.  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nH initially told a law enforcement agent that he did not know V. (Tr. 137) \nEventually he admitted that he met a female at a club on January 31, 2001, and that he \ntook her to his house, where they engaged in sexual activity. (Tr. 137) He did not \u201cget\u201d \nher name. (Tr. 137) He kissed around her vaginal area, but did not engage in oral \nsodomy with her. (Tr. 137) While she was in his bedroom, she advised H that she was \nenlisted. (Tr. 137) H immediately stopped his sexual activity, drove her to a restaurant, \nand then to her barracks. (Tr. 137)  \n \nH said he had given keys to his residence to Applicant and W. While he was in \nthe bedroom, Applicant and W entered his residence to check on H. They knocked on \nthe bedroom door, which was closed. H said he was OK, and they left. (Tr. 137-138) At \nfirst H said he was sure the door had not opened; however, later he said his bedroom \ndoor may have come open, but he did not think that it did. H said the female did not \nwant to be caught with an officer. (Tr. 137-139) H later said the female became upset \nwhen the other guys entered the room where H and V had been engaging in sexual \nactivity. (Tr. 138) \n \nW\u2019s statement to law enforcement, PE 9 \n \n \nW\u2019s statement to law enforcement was consistent with the statements of other \nwitnesses until he described the point at which W and Applicant arrived at H\u2019s bedroom \ndoor way on January 31, 2001. W stated: \n \nI knocked on [H\u2019s bedroom] door, and the door opened slightly. I saw two \nfigures on the bed. I heard a female voice stating something like [\u201cwho\u2019s \nthat?\u201d H] then stated, \"What\u2019s up gentlemen, I am alright.\" I felt \nuncomfortable, turned and walked past [Applicant] into the living room. \n[Applicant] was about five steps behind me. I then walked into the kitchen, \nand got a drink of water. [Applicant] and I waited in the living room, for \nmaybe five (5) minutes. I recall the TV being on in the living room. I don't \nrecall what show was on. [H] did not come out of his bedroom, so we left \nthe house. [Applicant] and I then drove directly back to [base]. I drove \n[Applicant] to the [club] to pick-up his car. When we got to the [club], \n[Applicant] asked that I just drop him off at home. [Applicant] and I both \nlive in base housing, just a few houses apart.  .  .  . I would guess the time \nwas about 2345 hours, when I got home. \n \nW denied that he entered H\u2019s bedroom on the evening of January 31, 2001. He denied \nthat he had any physical or sexual contact with the female that was on H\u2019s bed that \nevening. He denied knowing the woman who was in bed with H that evening.6   \n \n \n6 During the summer of 2000, a female enlisted person, C, saw W and V dancing at the club on \napproximately three occasions. (Tr. 221) In the summer of 2000, another female enlisted person, D, \nlistened in during a telephone conversation between W and V in which W and V discussed getting \ntogether. (Tr. 224)  Thus, W\u2019s statement about not recognizing V is not credible.  \n   \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nTelephone records \n \n \nNeither Applicant nor W called H on January 31, 2001 (evening of sexual activity \nbetween H and V) to check on him. On February 5, 2001, V called W four times, at the \nbehest of law enforcement to attempt to obtain incriminating admissions from him. (Tr. \n126-128, 134-135; PE 5, 6) Their telephone conversations were tape recorded. W \nindicated he did not know who V was, and had no knowledge of the January 31, 2001, \nincident, asserting that the phone calls must be a joke. V threatened to call law \nenforcement to report the rape, and W discussed having a meeting with V or calling V \nback.  \n \nOn February 5 and 6, 2001, H and W, H and Applicant, and W and Applicant \ncommunicated with each other several times over the telephone. From 4:49 pm to 5:35 \npm, on February 5, 2001, H, W, and H called each other five times, and the three \nlongest telephone conversations were 7 minutes, 25 minutes, and 27 minutes. Law \nenforcement interviewed H, W, and Applicant on February 6, 2001.  \n \nDeoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) tests \n \nA law enforcement agent testified that, five days after the alleged sex offenses, \nthree used condoms and a partially full box on unused condoms were found in the \ngarbage outside H\u2019s residence. (Tr. 141-142) The condoms were inside a sealed plastic \ngarbage bag containing various items of trash including bones from chicken wings and \ntomato peelings. (Tr. 141-142) H was present when his garbage was searched and \nindicated he had chicken wings several days previously. (Tr. 142) The garbage inside \nH\u2019s kitchen contained chicken wings and tomato peelings. (Tr. 142) \n \nThe DNA examiner, M, testified that two of those condoms contained DNA on \ntheir outside showing some consistency with V's DNA. (Tr. 160-163) The inside of one \ncondom showed some consistency with Applicant\u2019s DNA; however, M refused to label \nthe contents of the condom as a match to Applicant\u2019s DNA. (Tr. 160-163). M concluded \nthat Applicant could not be excluded as the donor of the DNA. In 2003-2005, M was \nimplicated in nine discrepancies involving contamination of samples and providing false \ntesting information. See United States v. Luke, 63 M.J. 60, 63 (C.A.A.F. 2006). The \nCourt of Appeals for the Armed Forces ordered a hearing in Luke to assess for \nprejudice due to the possibility that the same DNA expert, M, contaminated the DNA \nsamples in Luke\u2019s case or falsified Luke\u2019s test results.7     \n \nUpon retest of the three condoms in October 2006 by a different DNA expert, all \nthree condoms tested negative for semen, but epithelial or skin cells were found on \neach condom. V\u2019s DNA was confirmed on all three condoms. (Item 19 at 24) For the \n \n7 In Luke, M examined the bed sheet and the bra for stains that contained saliva. Luke, 63 M.J. at \n62. M testified that each contained cells from which DNA could be obtained, so a portion of each was \npreserved for another examiner who would perform DNA tests. Id. M did not actually perform the DNA \ntests in Luke. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces recognized that M could have \ncontaminated the sheet and bra, causing the DNA test to falsely implicate Luke.  \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ninside of the first condom (7(1)), \u201cthe remaining partial DNA profile from the inside of the \ncondom could not have originated from\u201d Applicant, W, or H. (emphasis added) Id. For \nthe inside of the second condom (7(2)), \u201cthe remaining partial DNA profile from the \ninside of the condom is consistent with originating from unknown Individual #1.\u201d \nApplicant, W, and H \u201care excluded.\u201d Id. For the third condom (9), \u201cthe remaining partial \nDNA profile is consistent with originating from unknown individual #1 and genetically \ntyped as male,\u201d and \u201cthe remaining partial DNA profile could not have originated from\u201d \nApplicant, H, or W. (emphasis added) Id. The DNA profile for the third condom was \ninconclusive \u201cdue to degraded or insufficient amount of human DNA.\u201d Id. \n \nBoth H and V agreed that they engaged in sexual activity on January 31, 2001.   \nV said the only one who had sexual intercourse with her was the Applicant. (Tr. 191, \n194) H denied that he used a condom, and V was unsure whether Applicant used a \ncondom.  (Tr. 138, 191, 193, 202) V said she saw three or four condoms on H\u2019s bed. \n(Tr. 193, 202) H claimed he used a different brand of condom than those found in his \ntrash. (Tr. 138) V said she did not remember whether the condoms on the bed were \nunwrapped or not. (Tr. 193)  \n   \nResolution of charges against Applicant \n \n \nOn January 31, 2002, a military judge sitting as a general court-martial found \nApplicant not guilty of conspiracy with H and W to commit an indecent act with V, \nviolation of a lawful general regulation (fraternization), rape of V, forcible sodomy of V, \nand engaging in indecent, sexual acts with V in the presence of H and W, in violation of \nArticles 81, 92, 120, 125, and 134, UCMJ. The military judge found Applicant guilty of \nconspiracy with H and W to make a false official statement to law enforcement, conduct \nunbecoming an officer \u201cby wrongfully and dishonorably engaging in sexual activities\u201d \nwith V in the presence of other officers, and making a false sworn statement, in violation \nof Articles 81, 133, and 134, UCMJ. The court-martial sentenced Applicant to forfeit \n$500 pay per month for two months and a reprimand.  \n \nIn December 2004, the Judge Advocate General set aside the false swearing \ncharge after completing his required review under Article 69(a), UCMJ. In August 2005, \nthe Government disclosed the compromise of the credibility of the DNA expert who \ntested condoms seized from the trash outside H\u2019s residence and who testified at \nApplicant\u2019s trial. The Judge Advocate General reviewed the 2006 re-test of the three \ncondoms. On June 4, 2009, the Judge Advocate General stated:  \n \nIn light of the significant differences between the new DNA evidence and \nthe DNA evidence presented at trial, the arguments and theories8 that \n                                            \n8 The Judge Advocate General\u2019s memorandum of June 4, 2009, provides:  \n \nThe DNA evidence, as properly tested, not only fails to implicate the three defendants, \nbut it also presents possible theories of the case and interpretations of the evidence that \nare favorable to the defense. For instance, the fact that the alleged victim\u2019s cells were on \nthe inside and outside of each condom, combined with the fact that the condoms were \nfound outside [H\u2019s] house, could lead a trier-of-fact to wonder whether the alleged victim \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nwould have been available to the defense with knowledge of the new \nevidence and all the other pertinent facts, I conclude that this evidence \nwould probably produce a substantially more favorable outcome for the \naccused. \n \n(Item 18 at 5) In regard to the conspiracy to make a false official statement offense, \u201cin \norder to effect the object of the conspiracy, the said [Applicant, H, and W] did each \nmake a false statement to [law enforcement].\u201d Id. The Judge Advocate General noted \nthat the three accused made multiple statements to law enforcement, and it could not \nbe established \u201cwhich statement the military judge concluded was false.\u201d Id. Thus, the \nconspiracy conviction was not reviewable and could not be affirmed.  The Judge \nAdvocate General set aside the last two charges and authorized a new trial under \nArticle 73, UCMJ. However, no new trial is anticipated. The sentence at the first trial \nwould be the maximum sentence limitation for his retrial, and Applicant is now retired. \nSee FORM at 10 n. 33.  \n \nFORM response \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel argues that V\u2019s allegations against Applicant are not credible \nbecause of inconsistencies between her testimony at trial and her testimony at \nApplicant\u2019s Article 32 testimony, or lack of memory of details, such as: (1) whether V \ntold Applicant or H she was enlisted; (2) where she was located at the club when she \nfirst saw Applicant; (3) whether she spoke to Applicant at the club on January 31, 2001; \n(4) the particular room where the dance in the club was located; and (5) whether others \nwere expected at H\u2019s residence on January 31, 2001.  \n \nV was not able to describe whether Applicant used a condom, whether Applicant \nwas circumcised, or the fraternity brand on Applicant\u2019s upper arm. Applicant\u2019s pubic hair \nand bodily fluids were not found on V\u2019s person or at H\u2019s residence.9 Several witnesses \nat trial opined that V was not credible and had a poor reputation for honesty. Other \nwitnesses opined that Applicant was a credible person, and had a good reputation for \nhonesty. \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel contends the lack of corroboration concerning whether V \ndanced with Applicant at the Super Bowl party in 2001, absence of physical injuries to \nV, and V\u2019s lack of agitation at the restaurant after the sexual incident and when she \n \nmay have planted the condoms herself. Moreover, the presence of one, if not two \nunidentified males on all three of the condoms also raises significant questions.  \n \nItem 19 at 20. See also FORM response at 17. The DNA expert who testified in Applicant\u2019s trial was male, \nand handled all three condoms. He was disciplined for sloppy lab work relating to several cases. There is \nno evidence that the laboratory excluded the DNA expert\u2019s own DNA as the source of the male skin cells \nfound on the condoms. There is no evidence that V knew if or when law enforcement would search \nApplicant\u2019s trash for condoms.  \n \n9 When law enforcement searched H\u2019s bedroom the bedding had been removed from the bed. \nOther beds in his residence did not have the bedding removed. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndescribed the incident at the Sexual Assault Resource Center are inconsistent with \nbeing sexually assaulted earlier and cast further doubt on V\u2019s credibility.   \n \nCharacter evidence10 \n \n \nApplicant has a 4.6 average of all officer fitness reports. He has received: four \nawards of the service Commendation Medal, five awards of the service Achievement \nMedal, four awards of the Meritorious Unit Commendation, two awards of the service \nBattle Efficiency Ribbon, two awards of the Good Conduct Medal, two awards of the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, four \nawards of the service Deployment Ribbon, three awards of the Overseas Service \nRibbon, two awards of the service Recruiting Service Ribbon, and the service Expert \nRifle and Pistol Ribbons.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s file has numerous letters lauding his duty performance and dedication \nto the service. His file was replete with recommendations for promotion to O-4 and for \nassignment to sensitive, high profile duties. The testimony at trial of a three-star flag \nofficer, a two-star flag officer, and an O-6 level officer during Applicant\u2019s trial lauded \nApplicant\u2019s good character, solid integrity, or tireless efforts on behalf of his commands \nduring his 20-year military career.   \n \n  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \n \n10The Staff Judge Advocate\u2019s post trial recommendation, dated November 1, 2002, and the \nnumerous letters and awards from Applicant\u2019s personnel records are the basis for the information in this \nparagraph.   \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the initial \nburden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at \n531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance,\u201d and \n\u201cis such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct \nunder any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR \nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly stated: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole \nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them \napply to the particular facts of a case.

By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether [Applicant] was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \nV\u2019s statement describing Applicant\u2019s conduct on January 31, 2001, is credible. \nThere is no record evidence supporting any reason for her to falsely accuse Applicant of \nsuch serious crimes.11 Applicant and V agree that they barely knew each other before \nthe sexual incident of January 31, 2001. Applicant and W claim that they went to H\u2019s \nresidence to check on H\u2019s welfare, even though Applicant, W, and H had all had been \nconsuming alcohol, and it was risky for W to drive after consuming alcohol. Applicant \nand W could have called H\u2019s cell phone number to check on his welfare. When they \narrived at H\u2019s residence, they saw H\u2019s vehicle and knew he arrived home safely. \nNevertheless, they entered H\u2019s residence without knocking on the front door or ringing \nhis doorbell. H had left the front door unlocked, which is a clear indication he expected \ntheir arrival, wanted them to enter his residence, and anticipated that he did not want to \nprematurely alert V concerning their arrival. Applicant and W\u2019s statements about driving \nto H\u2019s residence to check on H are not credible.  \n \nH and V agree that they were engaging in consensual sexual activity when \nApplicant and W arrived at H\u2019s bedroom door supposedly to check on H\u2019s welfare. It is \nmore reasonable to infer that Applicant and W drove 20-30 minutes to H\u2019s residence \nbecause they wanted to engage in sexual activity with V. Applicant and W stripped off \n \n11 Applicant\u2019s counsel suggests that V had four different reasons to falsely accuse Applicant of \nsexual crimes. First, V was upset because she thought W, who was \u201cfine\u201d or very handsome, saw V at H\u2019s \nresidence and V may have been upset about losing a chance for a relationship with W. Second, \u201ca \nreasonable inference may be that [V] thought she had a chance at a trifecta in bringing three [officers] \ndown for the price of one.\u201d Form Response at 9. Third, V may have thought that V\u2019s acquaintance would \nreport her for fraternization so she decided that \u201c[s]triking first with a phony rape report must have \nseemed like a logical course of action.\u201d Form Response at 14. Fourth, V may have wanted to strike back \nat W because \u201cshe felt spurned.\u201d Form Response at 15. Ultimately Applicant\u2019s counsel concludes, \nApplicant \u201cwas an innocent bystander caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in the sights of a liar \nwho for whatever reason, decided to take down three [officers].\u201d Form Response at 16.    \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ntheir clothes, except for Applicant\u2019s tank top, entered H\u2019s bedroom, and proceeded to \nengage in sexual acts upon V, even though Applicant and W did not have V\u2019s consent \nto engage in this sexual activity. Moreover, even if she had consented, Applicant would \nhave committed conduct unbecoming an officer and indecent acts by engaging in \nsexual intercourse with V while H and W were watching this sexual activity.  \n \nOn February 5, 2001, after V called W and threatened to disclose the rape to law \nenforcement, H, W, and Applicant coordinated their false statements to law enforcement \nto ensure consistency. Their plan and agreement was to assert that W and Applicant did \nnot enter H\u2019s bedroom. Applicant subsequently made a false statement to law \nenforcement that he did not enter H\u2019s bedroom. This behavior established conspiracy to \nmake false statements, and making false statements, in violation of Articles 81, and \n107, UCMJ, as well as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Additionally, Applicant engaged in sexual \nintercourse with V, a 19-year-old enlisted woman, in the presence of H and W. This \nbehavior constitutes conduct unbecoming an officer, and indecent acts, in violation of \nArticles 133 and 134, UCMJ. There is more than substantial evidence to prove these \nmilitary crimes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply with respect to Applicant\u2019s indecent acts, \nconduct unbecoming an officer, conspiracy and making false statements, even though \nhe does not have a conviction for any of these offenses.      \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 30(a) partially applies. None of the other mitigating conditions fully apply. A \nsubstantial period of time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, and it \nhappened under unusual circumstances. The offenses occurred on January 31, 2001, \nmore than nine years ago. Applicant has left active service. He has remarried. There is \nno evidence of any other disciplinary action, misconduct, or arrests.   \n \nThe case of ISCR 07-14127 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug 12, 2010) is instructive. In that \ncase the Applicant was a heavy drug user from 1975 to 1990, while holding a security \nclearance. Additionally, he provided false information about his history of illegal drug \nabuse on his security clearance applications from 1975 to 2001. In 2005, he provided \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \naccurate information about his history of drug abuse \u201cfollowing a pre-polygraph \nexamination.\u201d Id. at 4. The administrative judge determined his offenses were not recent \nand mitigated his misconduct under Guidelines E and J. The Appeal Board reversed the \nfavorable security clearance decision, concluding the Applicant\u2019s conduct continued to \n\u201ccast doubt upon his reliability and good judgment.\u201d  Id.   \n \nThe Applicant in the instant case did not have a long history of history of drug \nabuse and falsifications of multiple security clearance applications, and yet the \nApplicant in ISCR Case No. 07-14127 admitted his long history of drug abuse and other \nmisconduct in 2005. On the other hand, the Applicant in the instant case had a brief \nepisode of illegal behavior (January 31, 2001 to February 6, 2001); however, he has not \nshown any remorse, apologized to the victim, or taken responsibility for his misconduct.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is not fully mitigated. He was not pressured into \ncommitting the misconduct. He was a mature, 36-year-old man with 19 years of military \nservice. V was only 19 years old. I have carefully considered all of the evidence and I \nconclude there is substantial evidence that he committed the offenses. His lawyer\u2019s \nattacks on the 19-year-old enlisted victim of these three officers do not convince me that \nshe framed three innocent officers for the reasons stated in n. 11, infra. Under all the \ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s offenses continue to \u201ccast doubt on the [Applicant\u2019s] \nreliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d There is insufficient assurance that \nother criminal offenses are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d There is insufficient evidence to establish \nhis rehabilitation.  \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating, \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \n \nTwo potentially pertinent disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) which states: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of:  .  .  . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations, \n \nand AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which states, \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information \nabout one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, \nsuch as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d  \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWith respect to the personal conduct concerns involving Applicant\u2019s conspiracy \nto make false statements, making false statements, and engaging in sexual intercourse \nwith a 19-year-old enlisted woman, in the presence of H and W, this behavior violates \nmultiple statutes or rules. As discussed in the criminal conduct section, this conduct \nviolates Articles 81, 107, 133, and 134, UCMJ. Moreover, making a false statement to \nfederal law enforcement concerning involvement in sexual offenses committed upon an \nenlisted woman violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  However, AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) does not apply \nbecause this conduct is covered under the criminal conduct guideline, as all rules \ninvolved, when violated, are criminal offenses. \n  \nCertainly, such crimes violate important civil and criminal rules in our society, and \nthese offenses are conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it adversely affects a \nperson\u2019s professional and community standing.  Thus, AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) applies and further \ninquiry concerning the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n \nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d \napplies to Applicant\u2019s offenses. Applicant\u2019s former commanding officer, supervisor, and \nsecurity officials are well aware of Applicant\u2019s offenses. His conduct is well-documented \nin court-martial, law enforcement, and appellate records. The federal government\u2019s \nknowledge of these allegations eliminates any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation \nor duress. I do not believe Applicant would compromise national security to avoid public \ndisclosure of these offenses. Any personal conduct security concerns (pertaining to \ndisclosure of his criminal conduct) are mitigated.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nThere are several factors tending to support reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access \nto classified information. He presented a very strong mitigation case at his court-martial, \nand his military records contain an outstanding record of dedicated, honorable service \nto his command, service, and the Department of Defense. He has left the service, \nremarried, volunteers in his community, and wishes to contribute to the Department of \nDefense as a contractor. I attribute his offenses in part to alcohol consumption, and the \nencouragement of two fellow officers and friends. Applicant deserves substantial credit \nfor serving his country in war and peace for 20 years. There is every indication that he is \nloyal to the United States. There were no allegations of security violations. He does not \nhave any felony arrests or any drug or alcohol-related arrests or convictions, aside from \nthe UCMJ offenses which occurred from January 31, 2001, to February 6, 2001. He is \nmotivated to have a successful career, and to retain his security clearance.    \n \nThere are more substantial whole-person factors weighing against reinstatement \nof Applicant\u2019s access to classified information at this time. Applicant\u2019s UCMJ violations \nwere not prudent or responsible. His conduct violated Articles 81, 107, 133, and 134, \nUCMJ. The offenses did not result from a brief, irresponsible impulse. His misconduct \ninvolved planning to go to H\u2019s residence to have sex with V, riding with W to H\u2019s \nresidence, undressing outside H\u2019s bedroom door, entering H\u2019s bedroom, engaging in \nsexual intercourse with V, planning the false statements to law enforcement with H and \nW, and making his false sworn written statement to law enforcement. The offenses \noccurred over a period of about seven days. He had ample opportunity to reconsider \nbefore taking each step in his criminal activity. He committed the offenses while on \nactive duty, as a commissioned officer, with 19 years of service. He was fully inculcated \nwith service values of integrity and honesty. He knew he was not supposed to engage in \nsexual activity with a 19-year-old enlisted woman. He held a secret-level security \nclearance when he committed the misconduct. Sexual abuse of V, and the subsequent \ncover-up, shows extraordinarily poor judgment.  \n \nApplicant has not apologized to V or indicated he regrets his misconduct. During \nthe sentencing phase of his court-martial, he said he accepted the judgment of the \ncourt. (Tr. 297-298) However, this statement does not constitute an admission of guilt \nbut is merely a statement of recognition of the court\u2019s finding. See FORM Response at \n11. The service has not held him fully accountable for his misconduct because the \ncourts-martial findings and sentence were set aside. Acceptance of responsibility, and a \nsincere statement of regret and remorse must occur or substantially more time must \nelapse without further misconduct before confidence in his judgment, character, integrity \nand trustworthiness can be restored.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 12968, the Directive, the AGs, and other cited references to \nthe facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. For the reasons stated, \nApplicant has not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case, and he is not eligible \nfor access to classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant's background Applicant was born in the U.S. to parents of Mexican citizenship. His mother at the time had a resident alien card that enabled her to live and work in the U.S. (see ex. 4). Not working or living in the U.S. at the time of Applicant\u2019s birth, she traveled to the U.S. in 1970 for Applicant\u2019s birth to ensure he would be a U.S. citizen (R.T., at 39-40). Shortly after Applicant was born, he and his mother returned to Mexico to live (see exs. 2 and 4; R.T., at 39-40). 3 As a primary student in Mexico, Applicant encountered early problems with his enrollment because of his U.S. citizenship. To resolve the concerns of Mexican school authorities, Applicant\u2019s father applied for Mexican citizenship in behalf of Applicant, who at the time was just13 years of age (see ex. C). Through his father\u2019s efforts, Applicant was naturalized as a Mexican citizen in 1983, and issued a Mexican passport in about 1985 at the age of 15 (ex. 4; R.T., at 42). When Applicant reached the age of 16 (in 1986), he went to live with his grandmother in the U.S., while he finished his schooling across the border in Mexico (see exs. 2 and 4; R.T., at 27). After finishing his secondary education, he enrolled in a U.S. university (R.T., at 40). He has ma",

A hearing was held on November 14, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.\nDecember 12, 2008\n\n2\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on November 24, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to consider retention\nof his Mexican passport and citizenship and document his surrender or destruction of\nhis passport and relinquishing of his Mexican citizenship should he make the decision to\ndo so (R.T., at 49-50).  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 10 days to\nNovember 26, 2008 to supplement the record. The Government was afforded three\ndays to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a\nfaxed cover letter confirming his decision to surrender his Mexican passport,\ndocumented receipt of his surrendered Mexican passport by his employer\u2019s facility\nsecurity officer (FSO), and a letter confirming his ownership of a small home in Mexico\nand inheritance expectancy, together with his expressing willingness to consider\nrenouncing his Mexican citizenship.  Department counsel did not object to these post-\nhearing submissions. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered as\nexhibits A through C.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to (a) be a dual citizen of the U.S. and\nMexico, (b) accept and maintain Mexican citizenship, (c) possess a valid Mexican\npassport that does not expire till 2015, (d) be unwilling to surrender or destroy his\nMexican passport, and (d) own a condominium in Mexico, including the land on which it\nis situated.     \n                                                                           \nFor his answer, Applicant admitted two of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations (i.e., his dual citizenship status, his Mexican passport possession, and his\ncondominium ownership). He denied the remaining three allegations.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted\nas relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\n \nApplicant's background\nApplicant was born in the U.S. to parents of Mexican citizenship.  His mother at\nthe time had a resident alien card that enabled her to live and work in the U.S. (see ex.\n4).  Not working or living in the U.S. at the time of Applicant\u2019s birth, she traveled to the\nU.S. in 1970 for Applicant\u2019s birth to ensure he would be a U.S. citizen (R.T., at 39-40).\nShortly after Applicant was born, he and his mother returned to Mexico to live (see exs.\n2 and 4; R.T., at 39-40). \n\n3\nAs a primary student in Mexico, Applicant encountered early problems with his\nenrollment because of his U.S. citizenship.  To resolve the concerns of Mexican school\nauthorities, Applicant\u2019s father applied for Mexican citizenship in behalf of Applicant, who\nat the time was just13 years of age (see ex. C).  Through his father\u2019s efforts, Applicant\nwas naturalized as a Mexican citizen in 1983, and issued a Mexican passport in about\n1985 at the age of 15 (ex. 4; R.T., at 42).  \nWhen Applicant reached the age of 16 (in 1986), he went to live with his\ngrandmother in the U.S., while he finished his schooling across the border in Mexico\n(see exs. 2 and 4; R.T., at 27).  After finishing his secondary education, he enrolled in a\nU.S. university (R.T., at 40). He has maintained his Mexican citizenship to date (R.T., at\n41).  His Mexican passport was renewed in 1995, and again in 2005 (R.T., at 28); it is\nnot due to expire until 2015.  \nApplicant is unmarried and has no children (ex. 1). He has a brother and sister\n(see ex. 1).  Both Applicant and his sister were given green cards in 1978 by the INS,\nand Applicant and his sister were later naturalized as U.S. citizens, along with their\nbrother (see exs. 1 and 4).  Why Applicant\u2019s U.S. citizenship by birth in the U.S. was not\nrecognized by the INS and U.S. State Department is not explained.\nBy virtue of his birth to parents of Mexican citizenship in the U.S. and subsequent\nnaturalization as a Mexican citizen, Applicant is a dual citizen of Mexico and the U.S.\nHis mother passed away in November 2005 (see ex. 2).  His father, his brother, and his\nbrother\u2019s wife all reside in Mexico.  Applicant stays in touch with his father and brother\non a regular basis (see ex. 2).   By contrast, his sister resides in the U.S.\n While Applicant remains committed to the U.S. and its valued principles, he has\nbeen reluctant to renounce his Mexican citizenship (ex. 2).  By giving up his Mexican\ncitizenship, he fears he would have to dispose of the Mexican condominium he\npurchased in 2002, and risk the forfeiture of his inheritance of his parent\u2019s home in\nMexico after his father passes away (ex. 2; R.T., at 48-49).  This is something he has\nnot wanted to do.  Applicant regularly visits his family in Mexico and stays in his\nMexican condominium on these visits.  \nApplicant has never been followed (to his knowledge) on his visits to Mexico,\nshould such a situation occur, he would definitely report it to his supervisor, FSO, and\nthe FBI (see ex. 2, at 4).  No members of his family have been subjected to coercion or\nduress by Mexican authorities (see ex. 2).  \nApplicant has never used his Mexican passport to travel to Mexico, and uses it\nstrictly for identification purposes when asked by Mexican authorities (R.T.,at 28, 43).\nHis assurances are corroborated by his documented Mexican passport (see ex. 3).\nPreviously, Applicant indicated that he did not want to surrender his Mexican passport\n(not due to expire until 2015).  After an opportunity to reconsider his decision, he\nindicated at hearing a willingness to surrender his Mexican passport (R.T., at 28-33)\nand consider renouncing his Mexican citizenship.  Afforded an opportunity to surrender\n\n4\nhis Mexican passport after the hearing, he documents its surrender to his employer\u2019s\nFSO (exs. A and B).  He also provided post-hearing documentation of his willingness to\nconsider renouncing his Mexican citizenship (see ex. C).\nApplicant has no business or financial interest in Mexico besides his\ncondominium  and inheritance expectancy and has no plans to invest in the country.  He\nhas never voted in a Mexican election or served in Mexico\u2019 military.  He has no debts or\nobligations to Mexico or any foreign country.  And he has accepted no educational,\nmedical, or other economic or political fiscal benefits from Mexico (save for his primary\nschool training and home ownership) that required his use of his Mexican citizenship.\nHe does expect to inherit his parent\u2019s residence in Mexico, along with his brother and\nsister, when his father passes away (R.T., at 46).  He values this property at\nsomewhere between $150,000 and $200,000 (R.T., at 27, 44-45).  He assures his\nallegiance lies with the U.S., and he would never do anything to hurt U.S. security\ninterests (R.T., at 47-48).    \nCountry Status of Mexico\n         Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world, and a country\nthat has made considerable strides in improving access to education and literacy rates\nover the past few decades (see ex. 5: Background Note: Mexico, U.S. Department of\nState, at 2 (April 2008)).  Mexico is a constitutional democracy that completed a number\nof important reforms in its freedom of information laws and criminal justice system under\ncurrent President Felipe Calderon (id, at 4).  Mexico\u2019s oil and gas interests are operated\nby a state-owned constitutionally established monopoly (Pemex), and Mexico is a\nprincipal supplier of both crude oil and gas to the U.S.  Its relations with the U.S. are as\nimportant as they are complex.  A stable, democratic, and economically prosperous\nMexico is fundamental to U.S. political, economic and security interests.  Illustrative of\nthe important state-to-state trade relations between these two neighbours is their\nNAFTA  partnership.  Illustrative of the reinforcement of their strategic ties is the\nSecurity and Prosperity Partnership, they forged (along with Canada) in 2005 (see id.,\nat 6).\nTo be sure, travel warnings are in place for U.S. citizens travelling in Mexico.\nDrug-related wars between criminal organizations seeking control of the major narcotics\ntrade that continues to rage along the U.S.-Mexico border have created heightened\nrisks for U.S. citizens residing or travelling in Mexico (see Travel Alert, Mexico, U.S.\nDepartment of State, at 2 (April 2008)).  Despite stepped up efforts by the Mexican\ngovernment to combat border violence with deployed military troops in various border\nregions, U.S. citizens are still advised to exercise caution when residing or travelling in\nunfamiliar areas of Mexico (id., at 2).\nPolicies \n                                                                                                                                                           \n      The revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\n\n5\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth\nin E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended\nto assist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense\ndecision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nSee Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 9.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\n\n6\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis \nApplicant presents as a U.S. citizen by birth who became a naturalized citizen of\nMexico through his father, who had Mexican citizenship by birth.  Aside from receiving\nprimary school benefits, owning a condominium and inheritance expectancy, and\npossessing a Mexican passport (which he uses for identification purposes only when\ntraveling to Mexico for family visits), Applicant has never exercised any active indicia of\ndual citizenship with Mexico. Claiming his principal affections lie with the U.S., he,\nnonetheless, retained his Mexican passport and citizenship, his Mexican condominium\nownership, and his inheritance expectancy.\nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite\ncritical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the\nforeign country over the interests of the U.S.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over\nApplicant's  preference for a foreign country over the U.S.\nBy virtue of his naturalized citizenship in Mexico through his father of Mexican\nbirth and citizenship, Applicant was endowed with Mexican citizenship, which could be\nrenounced by his expressed intention or actions.  This, Applicant  has never done, out\nof concern he would be required to dispose of his Mexican condominium and risk the\nforfeiture of his inheritance expectancy.  He does say that he is currently willing to\nconsider renouncing his Mexican citizenship. \nSince becoming a naturalized Mexican citizen as a young minor, Applicant has\ntaken no actions and exercised no Mexican privileges that can be fairly characterized as\nactive indicia of dual citizenship, save for (a) his receipt of primary schooling in Mexico,\n(b) his limited use of his Mexican passport for identification purposes when entering and\nexiting Mexico, (c) his ownership of his Mexican condominium, and(d) his retention of\nan inheritance expectancy.  He has not voted in Mexican elections or served in the\nMexican military.  He has accepted no preferential educational, medical or other\nbenefits from Mexico since becoming a naturalized Mexican citizen (save for his primary\nschooling, passport use, home ownership, and inheritance expectancy).  Nor has he\never performed or attempted to perform duties, or otherwise acted so as to serve the\ninterests of Mexico in preference to the interests of the U.S. since becoming a Mexican\ncitizen.\nBecause Applicant received primary schooling benefits in Mexico, possessed and\nused his Mexican passport and owns a Mexican condominium in Mexico, the\nGovernment may apply disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a) of AG \u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any\nright, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n\n7\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign\ncountry; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social\nwelfare, or  other  such benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship\nrequirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business\ninterests  in  another country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country;\n(7) voting in a foreign election.\"  \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s residence time in Mexico has been limited to his early\nchildhood years when he was subject to his parents\u2019 guidance and control, and his brief\nfamily trips since he returned to the U.S. to permanently reside in 1986.  He claims no\nintention to make Mexico his permanent residence.  So, at least as to any privileges he\nmay have enjoyed in attending Mexican primary schools as a minor under his parent\u2019s\nguidance and control, he may take some advantage of MC \u00b6 11 (c), \u201cexercise of the\nrights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor.\u201d\nBy relinquishing his Mexican passport, and expressing his willingness to\nrenounce his Mexican citizenship, Applicant has complied with the mitigation\nrequirements of MC \u00b6 11 (e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18.  And while his\nsurrendering his Mexican passport to his FSO does not automatically mitigate any past\nuse of the passport to enter and exit Mexico, his recited limited use of the passport is\ninsufficient by itself to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s preference for Mexico over the U.S.\nMoreover, since Applicant has also expressed his willingness to consider renouncing his\nMexican citizenship, he may invoke the mitigation benefits of MC \u00b6 11 (b), \u201cthe\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship\u201d as well.\nFailure to satisfy a mitigating condition may, of course, be taken into account\nwhen assessing an applicant's overall claim of extenuation, mitigation, or changed\ncircumstances, but may not be turned into a disqualifying condition.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 01-02270 (Appeal Bd. Aug. 29, 2003).  That Applicant may wish to keep his\nMexican citizenship out of concern for protecting his condominium ownership and\ninheritance expectancy in the country is not sufficient reason by itself to preclude him\nfrom mitigating security concerns over his holding dual citizenship and  property\ninterests in Mexico. \n\n8\nWhole person precepts favor Applicant's preference for the U.S. over Mexico.\nHe is a U.S. citizen by birth and has always demonstrated his loyalty for the U.S.  His\nprincipal financial interests are situated in the U.S.  And his brief trips to Mexico have\nbeen devoted to his interest in seeing his family on periodic visits.    \nOverall, Applicant persuades that his preference is with the U.S.  He satisfies his\nproof burden in several ways: demonstrated his lack of any exercise of any privileges\nassociated with his Mexican citizenship, save for his receipt of primary schooling in\nMexico, his possession and limited use of his Mexican passport, his ownership of his\ncondominium in Mexico, and his retention of a Mexican inheritance expectancy.\nApplicant absolves himself of foreign preference concerns and carries his evidentiary\nburden on the presented issue of whether his preference lies with his native country\n(U.S.) or the country (Mexico) where he was naturalized as a minor through his father\u2019s\nMexican citizenship.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f of Guideline C.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in 2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \n                                  \nRoger C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g of the SOR, with explanations.

On December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines G\nand J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 20, 2008. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 22, 2008, and requested a hearing before\nJune 15, 2009\n\nTr. 114.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application) at 6, 10, 25-26; Tr. 25, 68-69.\n2\n2\n \nan administrative judge. DOHA received the request on December 29, 2008.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 25, 2009, and I received the\ncase assignment on March 25, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 6, 2009,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 30, 2009. The government offered 12\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 12, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant and three witnesses testified on his behalf. He submitted three\nexhibits (AE) A through C, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection.  The record closed on April 30, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on May 18, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on April 17, 2009. (Tr. 8.) I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. After consulting with counsel, Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days\nnotice. (Tr. 8.) \nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR at the end of the hearing to\ncorrect the amount of the fine in SOR \u00b6 1.e. from $2,000 to $200. This request conforms\nwith Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object to the motion,\nwhich I granted. SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e is amended as proposed.1\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He neither admitted nor denied the factual\nallegation in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR.  \nApplicant, who is 52 years old, works as a senior field engineer for a Department\nof State contractor. He began working for his employer in December 1985. He has held\na security clearance since 1986, without any violations of security procedures. He\nattended college, but has not completed his bachelor\u2019s degree.2\nApplicant began drinking alcohol at age 19. Initially, he drank socially, but later\nhis alcohol consumption increased. The police arrested Applicant for his first driving\nwhile intoxicated (DWI) offense in December 1979. He pled guilty and paid a fine\nbetween $100 and $200. In February 1981, the police arrested Applicant for his second\nDWI. He pled guilty, paid a $500 fine and the court suspended his driver\u2019s license for\n\nGE 2; GE 3; Tr. 69-70.\n3\nGE 2; GE 3.\n4\nGE 5; Tr. 72-75. \n5\nId.\n6\nTr. 42, 76. \n7\n3\n \none year. The court also recommended he attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which\nhe did for about one year. The police again arrested Applicant for DWI in September\n1982. He pled not guilty and the court appointed a lawyer to represent him. Shortly\nthereafter, he received a letter from the lawyer, advising that his case had been\ndismissed.3\nAs part of the security clearance process, Applicant completed two written\nstatements in March 1986, outlining the above arrests. He twice stated that he did not\nbelieve he had an alcohol problem.  \n4\nIn February 1987, the police arrested Applicant a fourth time for DWI. The court\nordered alcohol treatment at an inpatient facility to begin in May 1988. However, before\ntreatment began, Applicant broke his neck in an automobile accident and his treatment\nwas deferred. He experienced significant pain during his long recovery. He refused to\ntake pain medication; instead, he dramatically increased his use of alcohol to manage\nhis pain. The court outcome of this fourth arrest is unknown.  \n5\nIn February 1988, Applicant did seek alcohol treatment at a residential facility\nbecause he realized he was drinking much more than socially. He spent 28-30 days as\nan inpatient. He did not drink during his stay. Upon his discharge, this facility diagnosed\nApplicant with alcoholism, alcohol withdrawal and incomplete healed fracture - second\ncervical vertebrae. The treatment facility recommended total abstinence from \u201call mood-\nchanging, mind-altering, psycho-active substances\u201d; attend 90 AA meetings in 90 days,\nfollowed by a minimum of four AA meetings a week; obtain an AA sponsor; and attend a\n22-week continuing recovery group. Applicant acknowledges that he did not comply with\nall these recommendations. He did participate in the recovery group for a number of\nmonths and attended AA one to two times a week for a period of time.6\nApplicant remained sober for about two years. Eventually, he started drinking\nalcohol, at first casually. However, his alcohol consumption progressed. Because he did\nnot believe he had a drinking problem, he did not stop drinking. He believed his alcohol\nconsumption was under control.7\nIn January 1998, the police again arrested Applicant and charged him with\ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Pursuant to a plea bargain, Applicant pled\n\nGE 7; Tr. 76-77.\n8\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 12-14; Tr. 77-79, 103-104.\n9\nGE 12; Tr. 79-81, 97, 100-101, 112-113.\n10\nGE 11; Tr. 81-83, 98-99, 102.\n11\n4\n \nguilty to this charge. The court fined him $1,500, suspending $1,000; sentenced him to\n60 days, suspending all but 48 hours; and suspended his driver\u2019s license for one year.  \n8\n \nApplicant married in 1998. During his marriage, Applicant decreased his alcohol\nconsumption. Although he did not stop drinking entirely, at times he abstained from\nalcohol consumption for one or more months. His wife did not drink. He and his wife\nseparated in 2004 and divorced in 2005. When his marriage ended, he saw no reason\nto limit his alcohol consumption.9\nAgain, in December 2005, the police arrested and charged Applicant with DWI\nand DUI. Applicant pled guilty to DWI in June 2006 and the court dismissed the DUI\ncharge. The court fined him $300 and gave him probation before judgment. As a result\nof this conviction and at his own expense, the court restricted his driving by placing an\nalcohol interlock device (blow and go) on his car. This device prevented him from\ndriving his car if he consumed alcohol and his breath alcohol registered .02 on the\ndevice. Applicant continued to drink after his sentence. He acknowledged that in the first\nmonths, he learned how much he could drink and when he needed to stop drinking\nbefore he drove his car with this device. Applicant has not been arrested for any\ncriminal matter since this date.10\nIn December 2006, Applicant decided to check himself into an alcohol treatment\nfacility because he believed that he would not live long if he continued to drink alcohol.\nHis inpatient stay lasted 14 days. He actively participated in his treatment as shown by\nhis treatment record. The facility diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent, but offered\nno opinion about his prognosis. Upon his discharge, Applicant enrolled in an intensive\noutpatient treatment program and returned to AA. He completed the 90 AA meetings in\n90 days, obtained a temporary sponsor, and found a home group, which is a meeting he\nwould attend regularly and participate in running.11\nApplicant consumed his last alcoholic drink on December 14, 2006. He\nacknowledges he is an alcoholic and understands that alcoholism is a progressive\ndisease. He believes that his sanity and spiritual condition depend upon him maintaining\nsobriety. He has not had any alcohol since December 2006 and has no intent to drink\nalcohol in the future. He is convinced that if he ever drinks again he will die. He\ncontinues to attend and participate in his home AA group and a second home AA group,\neach at least once a week. He lives one day at a time. He has changed his friends and\nhis activities. He participates in more family activities. He boats, fishes, and listens to\n\nGE 10; Tr. 84-96.\n12\nAE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 22-30.\n13\nTr. 57-66.\n14\n5\n \nlive music. His drink of choice is cranberry juice, tea or water. He keeps alcohol in his\nhouse for friends. He does not crave alcohol and has not since December 2006.12\nApplicant\u2019s program manager testified on his behalf. He has known Applicant\nsince 1986 when they began working together. Applicant has held a security clearance\nsince 1986 and has never been involved in any security breaches. Applicant\u2019s alcohol\nconsumption never interfered with his work performance. His program manager never\nobserved Applicant consuming alcohol at work or arriving at work intoxicated. Since he\nstopped drinking, his manager has observed an improvement in Applicant\u2019s attitude and\nwork performance. His performance evaluations for the last three years support his\nimprovement. Applicant has taken more responsibility for managing the work site.\nApplicant told him about his alcohol problems and arrests. Applicant has never lied to\nhim or co-workers. He trusts Applicant and recommends him for a security clearance.13\nApplicant\u2019s fiancee testified. They met at work in February 2008. Since then, she\nhas not observed Applicant drink alcohol and does not believe he drinks. She knows\nabout his past alcohol problems. He attends AA at least twice a week. She\nacknowledges Applicant keeps alcohol in his house and states that he is comfortable\nwith alcohol in the house. He drinks cranberry juice or unsweetened tea. She describes\nhim as honest, trustworthy, social, gregarious, outgoing, and reliable.14\nApplicant\u2019s sister also testified. Like the other witnesses, she confirmed that\nApplicant is not drinking. She last saw Applicant consume alcohol in July 2006, although\nshe believes he continued to consume alcohol after this time. They lived together from\nOctober 1993 until March 1998, when she moved into her own house. They visit with\neach other every weekend or every other weekend, usually at Applicant\u2019s house near\nthe beach. She knows Applicant entered an alcohol treatment facility 20 years ago\nbecause she visited him. He remained sober for about two years after treatment. In\n1990, she observed him drinking at their other sister's wedding, which concerned her.\nWhen he entered treatment in 2006, she visited him while he was an inpatient and she\nparticipated in family treatment sessions. She noticed a significant difference between\nhis first and second treatment. In 2006, she knew he was absolutely serious about his\ntreatment. He told her \u201cit was his belief that if he did not stop drinking, he was going to\ndie.\u201d Since completing his latest treatment, Applicant is more reliable. He makes plans\nfor the future, has a life and has a relationship. He attends AA, even when on vacation.\nHe has permanently changed his lifestyle. He is a much different person than when he\nis drinking alcohol. When he drinks alcohol, she notices a change in his personality:\nApplicant is not a very likable person, he acts like a know-it-all and she sees physical\nsigns of his drinking alcohol, such as shaking, weight gain, slurred speech, and\nsignificant sweating. When he is sober, he is friendly, personable, an interesting\n\nId. at 40-50; GE 11, supra note 11.\n15\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n16\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE3.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\n6\n \nconversationalist, and very intelligent. She considers him trustworthy and recommends\nhim for a security clearance.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n16\n\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations.

Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is required. See\nUnited States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-\n248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)(explaining standard\nof review).\n7\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n8\n \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing conditions may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence; and\n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion\nof an alcohol rehabilitation program.\nApplicant began consuming alcohol at age 19. His alcohol consumption led to\narrest for DWI as early as 1979. Between 1979 and 1987, the police arrested him four\ntimes for DWI. In 1988, he received inpatient treatment at a substance abuse facility,\nwhich diagnosed alcoholism. For two years after his treatment, he remained sober. He\nbegan drinking again in 1990. His alcohol consumption increased and resulted in\nanother arrest, this time for DUI. During his marriage, he controlled his alcohol\nconsumption. When he marriage ended, his alcohol consumption resumed and\nincreased. The police arrested him again for DUI in December 2005. Based on\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol consumption, DWI or DUI arrests, 1988 diagnosis, and\nrelapse following treatment in 1988, the above disqualifying conditions apply.     \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns and the\nfollowing may be applicable in this case:\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\n9\n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant acknowledges he is an alcoholic. He understands the dangers to him if\nhe drinks again. He accepts responsibility for his alcohol problem. In 2006,  on his own\ninitiative, he sought treatment for his alcohol use. He actively participated in his\ntreatment at the facility and continued with intensive followup treatment after his\ndischarge. He still actively participates in AA on a regular basis. He has changed his\nlifestyle, his friends and his attitude. He enjoys his life as he realizes it is much better\nsince he stopped drinking alcohol. His fiancee, program manager and sister confirm that\nhe no longer drinks. He does not intend to drink in the future and works each day to\nachieve that goal. His treatment facility made no prognosis about his long-term sobriety,\nbut he has remained sober for two and one-half years. He has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns about his alcohol consumption.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct directly relates to his alcohol consumption. Because\nof his alcohol use, the police arrested him six times for either DWI or DUI. The court\nconvicted him in all but one case. These disqualifying conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\n\n10\n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement; and,\nApplicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in three and one-half years ago. His arrests did\nnot occur under unusual circumstances, thus, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 32(a) does not\napply.  However, Applicant has stopped drinking alcohol, the reason for his arrests. He\nhas successfully completed treatment for alcohol dependency. He continues to\nparticipate in AA programs as he desires not to drink again. He changed his lifestyle\nand his friends. His work performance and attitude at work improved. He has assumed\nmore responsibility at work. Because he is so committed to remaining sober, there is\nlittle likelihood that his criminal conduct will reoccur. He has mitigated the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns about his criminal conduct.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \n\n11\n \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nbegan drinking alcohol as a young adult, initially at social functions. His alcohol\nconsumption steadily increased and resulted in four arrests for DWI in eight years. He\nsought alcohol treatment in 1988, but did not fully commit to total abstinence and the\nidea he was an alcoholic. Without this commitment, he resumed his alcohol\nconsumption about two years after his treatment. Although he believed he controlled his\nalcohol consumption, he did not and was again arrested for a DUI in 1998. During his\nmarriage, he limited his alcohol consumption, sometimes not drinking any alcohol for\ntwo or three months, but never totally abstaining. When his marriage ended, he stopped\nattempting to control his alcohol consumption and another DUI arrest occurred in 2005.\nHis conduct reflects a serious, long-term problem with alcohol.\nA year after his 2005 arrest, Applicant decided to seek treatment for his alcohol\naddiction and committed himself to conquering his abusive use of alcohol. He entered a\nsubstance abuse treatment facility and actively participated in its programs. Upon his\ndischarge, he immediately enrolled in followup treatment programs and actively\nparticipated in these programs as he wanted to stop drinking. He acknowledges he is an\nalcoholic and admits he must work each day on his goal of never consuming alcohol\nagain. He provided substantial information at the hearing indicating that he understands\nhis alcohol use and the resulting problems. He appreciates alcohol\u2019s negative effects on\nhis life, and is committed to remaining sober. He incorporates the tenets of AA and lives\nby this philosophy. He knows he must remain sober because his sanity and spirituality\ndepend upon it. I find his testimony about his present attitude and approach to alcohol\ncredible.\nWhile I recognize that Applicant relapsed within two years after his first treatment\nand he has been sober about two and one-half years, I give great weight to his sister\u2019s\nhighly credible testimony about his alcohol use and his current sobriety. She has known\nhim all her life. She knows when he is drinking because she notices his personality\nchanges to a person she does not like. She visited him during his first treatment\nprogram in 1988 and his second treatment program in 2006. She recognized a\ndifference in his attitude towards treatment the second time, stating that he was\n\u201cabsolutely serious about this\u201d. She clearly discussed her observations about his\nbehavior before and after he stopped drinking. She sees a change and a commitment\nby him to remain sober that did not exist in 1988. \nApplicant\u2019s fiancee and program manager affirmed his current sobriety. Based on\nhis sister\u2019s highly persuasive testimony about his sobriety and change in attitude\ntowards alcohol, I find that Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns\nabout his alcohol consumption. Since he is not drinking, his criminal conduct is not a\nsecurity concern.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n12\n \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption\nand criminal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 44-years-old. He is divorced and has three children. He has shared custody of his son. He has been employed in his current job since 1986 (GE 1). Applicant has held a security clearance since 1984 except for four years (1999-2002) when his position did not require a clearance (Tr. 24). In January 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with lane traveling (an illegal lane change) and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) (GE 6). He pled no contest to alcohol-related reckless driving and was sentenced to a fine of $950 and a 90 day suspended jail sentence. He attended 16 hours of Alcohol Awareness classes and served 24 hours of community service (GE 5). On that particular evening Applicant had three glasses of wine during a meal at a restaurant (Tr. 51). He walked to a club after that and had two whiskey and cokes (Tr. 51). He did not believe the officer complied with correct procedure and Applicant refused to take the Breathalyzer test (Tr. 56). The police report notes the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) was less than .08 (the legal limit in the state). Applicant\u2019s drinking habits after the 2004 incident changed dramatically.

DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 15, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May\n14, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A\nJune 8, 2009\n\n2\nand B, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 26,\n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 24, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.b; and \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b of the SOR, with explanations. He\nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is 44-years-old. He is divorced and has three children. He has shared\ncustody of his son. He has been employed in his current job since 1986 (GE 1).\nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1984 except for four years (1999-2002)\nwhen his position did not require a clearance (Tr. 24).\nIn January 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with lane traveling (an\nillegal lane change) and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) (GE 6). He pled no\ncontest to alcohol-related reckless driving and was sentenced to a fine of $950 and a 90\nday suspended jail sentence. He attended 16 hours of Alcohol Awareness classes and\nserved 24 hours of community service (GE 5). On that particular evening Applicant had\nthree glasses of wine during a meal at a restaurant (Tr. 51). He walked to a club after\nthat and had two whiskey and cokes (Tr. 51). He did not believe the officer complied\nwith correct procedure and Applicant refused to take the Breathalyzer test (Tr. 56). The\npolice report notes the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) was less than .08 (the legal limit\nin the state). \nApplicant\u2019s drinking habits after the 2004 incident changed dramatically. He did\nnot drink and drive for about two years. He then decided not to drive if he had more than\none or two drinks (Tr. 61). Applicant\u2019s habit was to have some wine one day a week (Tr.\n61). He acknowledged that he believed the 2004 alcohol classes to be \u201csuperficial.\u201d He\ncompared the later 2007 counseling to the classes. After the 2007 court program,\nApplicant had a better understanding of the effect of alcohol on his behavior (Tr.60).  \nOn April 1, 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with a DUI and improper\nlane operation. That evening Applicant had approximately four or five glasses of wine\n(one bottle) in his home over the course of five hours (Tr. 27). After his dinner, he had a\nwhiskey and coke. He had an argument with his girlfriend on the telephone. After that\ndiscussion he drove to a nearby bar. He consumed three whiskey and cokes (Tr. 29).\nHe acknowledges that he was intoxicated at that point. The police pulled him over for an\nimproper left turn. \nApplicant pled guilty to the DUI and agreed to participate in a state sponsored\nsubstance abuse court program (DASAC) program. The participation in the program\npermitted the DUI charge to be held in abbeyance (no sentencing) provided Applicant\n\nHe reported to the court on one occasion he had half a glass of wine at a dinner. He was tested\n1\nimmediately following that but the test result was negative.\n3\nsuccessfully completed the program (Tr. 38). The improper lane charge was dismissed\nin 2007 and the DUI was dismissed on July 7, 2008 (GE 3).\nApplicant takes full responsibility for the 2007 incident. He acknowledges that he\nput his life and the lives of others in danger. He deeply regrets having done that (Tr. 17).\nHe admits that he argued with his girlfriend and did not show good judgment by driving\nto the local bar (Tr. 17). \nIn 2007, an LCSW assessed Applicant upon entering the DASAC alcohol\ntreatment program. He was diagnosed as a chronic alcohol abuser. During the one year\ntreatment program Applicant was tested randomly (four times a month) for the use of\nillegal substances, including alcohol (AE B). Applicant did not use any illegal substance\nor alcohol for this period of time.  \n1\nIn July 2008, Applicant completed the DASAC program. He attended 30 hour-\nand-a-half counseling sessions. The prognosis for complete recovery was \u201cgood.\u201d He\nreported to court and his probation officer initially every week. His court ordered\nprobation ended in 2008. He now attends AA meetings on a weekly basis.\nApplicant describes his present day drinking as very moderate and very\ninfrequent. He believes he makes good choices and he no longer frequents places\nwhere he would drink excessively. He has had something to drink on three separate\noccasions over the last nine months. He limits himself to two drinks and only if there is a\nspecial event (wedding, Christmas). In March 2008, he ended the relationship with his\ngirlfriend in part because of pressure to drink. He was uncomfortable with her level of\ndrinking every weekend and did not want to live like that any more (Tr. 18). He\ndiscussed his relationship with his counselor who suggested that many people revert to\nold behaviors. Applicant did not discuss \u201cmoderate drinking\u201d with his counselor but did\nheed the caution about \u201changing around people who may lead one to drink to excess.\u201d\nHe believes he has truly changed his direction in life. He continues to attend AA\nmeetings voluntarily because it reminds him of what could happen. He does not\nfrequent bars or associate with people with whom he used to drink (Tr. 79). He does not\ndrink and drive (Tr. 78)\nApplicant is a systems engineer for a contractor. He is a trusted, reliable\nprofessional. He travels frequently for his work. Applicant consistently demonstrates top\nperformance. For the past five years, he has achieved an \u201cExceeds Expectation\u201d rating\nwhich ranks him in the top 30% of approximately 400 employees (AE A). \nApplicant provides direction to subcontractor teams with little supervision. He\ncompletes every project in an excellent manner. His work quality has been\nacknowledged by the Air Force customers and upper management in the company. He\nis one of the most valued and trusted employees. He acts responsibly and has no\n\n4\nattendance problems. He has never missed deadlines or meetings. His supervisor has\ntraveled with him and has never observed any impairment due to alcohol while on\nbusiness travel. Applicant\u2019s supervisor is aware of the alcohol charges and he\nrecommends him for a security clearance (AE A). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nIn this case, Applicant has two alcohol-related driving incidents (2004 and 2007).\nIn 2007, he admitted driving with impaired judgment due to the alcohol he consumed\nthat evening. In 2007, he consumed so much alcohol before his DUI, it is considered\n\u201cbinge\u201d consumption of alcohol. Applicant admitted that he was intoxicated in 2007 and\nthen drove his car.  Thus, AG \u00b6 22 (a) and (c) apply.\nIn June 2007, Applicant was given a diagnosis of chronic alcohol abuse by a\nlicensed clinical social worker during the court program. Thus, AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation\nof alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a\nstaff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d applies.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\n6\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant has two alcohol-related driving incidents. Since 2007, he has not had\nany other alcohol-related incidents. Applicant attended alcohol classes after his 2004\nincident. He abstained from drinking and driving for almost two years. He has received\ncounseling and treatment in a court program after the incident in 2007. Applicant has\nacknowledged that he abused alcohol in the past but now he is committed to a different\nlife style. Applicant attends AA of his own accord. Applicant maintains that his drinking\nis responsible at this point in his life. He has received a favorable diagnosis from a\nLCSW. He does not drink and drive. Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption\nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b and (d).\n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By it\u2019s\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct consists of the\ntwo alcohol-related DUI charges in 2004 and 2007 as discussed under the alcohol\nconsumption guideline. Thus, AG 31(a) and (b) apply in this case. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\n\n7\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nApplicant has provided mitigation under this guideline. The events occurred in 2004 and\n2007. There have not been any other instances. Applicant completed his court program\nand his 2007 DUI was dismissed in 2008. His rehabilitative efforts are described under\nthe previous guideline.  He understands the impact of consuming alcohol and then\ndriving, and assures this will not occur in the future. Future criminal conduct is unlikely\nto occur and thus his 2 previous DUIs do not cast doubt on his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. He continues to excel in his work and expressed\nremorse for the 2007 incident. Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply in this case.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has held a secret\nclearance for many years. He has no incidents or issues with protecting information.\nApplicant has excellent references from his employer. He has been charged with two\nalcohol-related driving incidents. Since that time he completed a court ordered\ntreatment program and modified his drinking. He was diagnosed recently by a licensed\nsocial worker of alcohol abuse. He has a good prognosis. He involved himself in AA on\nhis own accord. He left a relationship that could interfere with his commitment to a\ndifferent life. Applicant has had no other legal problems during his life. The last incident\noccurred in 2007.  \n.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\n\n8\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from criminal\nconduct and alcohol consumption. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFOR Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Contract Investigator who conducts personnel security background investigations, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his ability to protect classified information. The Applicant admits in part and denies in part the allegation set forth in the SOR under this guideline.

On October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 4, 2008, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on January 28, 2009, which contained seven separate Government\nExhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7 that were admitted into\nevidence.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or\nmitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on February 9, 2009,\nand he submitted a reply within the required time period, consisting of thirty-seven\nseparate Applicant\u2019s Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 1 through 37 that were\n\n2\nadmitted into evidence.  The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on\nMarch 16, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 44 years old and divorced.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as a Contract Investigator who conducts personnel security background\ninvestigations, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations that raise questions about his ability to protect classified\ninformation.   \nThe Applicant admits in part and denies in part the allegation set forth in the SOR\nunder this guideline.\n        \nThe Applicant served on active duty in the United States Army from September\n1982, to August 1985, and again from November 1986, to November 1994.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 5).  He received an honorable discharge on November 14, 1994.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 15).   \nFrom December 1998 to December 2001, the Applicant was employed as a\ncriminal investigator for the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command\u2019s\nMajor Procurement Fraud Unit.  He admits that in May 2001, while working as a criminal\ninvestigator for the Army military police, allegations were made against him for making\nfalse statements, tampering with a witness/victim/informant, and theft.  As a result of the\ninvestigation, the Applicant\u2019s access to classified information was suspended, he was\nassigned to desk work, and eventually terminated from his position.  The United States\nAttorney declined criminal prosecution.  Applicant denies the underlying conduct.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 4 and 7).  \nExcerpts from Army investigative reports indicate that on December 29, 2000,\nthe Applicant was contacted by a woman (referred to as Mrs. M.), who asked him to\nhelp her regarding a shoplifting investigation involving her brother-in-law.  Applicant\nknew the woman and her husband because they operated the day care center that the\nApplicant hired to watch his children.  Mrs. M.\u2019s brother-in-law had been apprehended\nfor shoplifting at the PX on the fort.  Mrs. M. called the Applicant for help because she\nknew that the Applicant was in law enforcement on the base.  The investigation\ndisclosed that the Applicant made several verbal false statements to two AAFES\nExchange detectives and two Department of the Army police officers, identifying Mrs. M.\nas his \u201cinformant\u201d and \u201csource\u201d in an apparent attempt to have Mrs. M. receive special\n\n3\ntreatment during the processing of her and her brother-in-law during the shoplifting\nincident. The investigation revealed that Mrs. M. was not in fact an \u201cinformant\u201d or a\n\u201csource\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 7).\n     \nDuring an interview on June 26, 2001, the Applicant admitted identifying Mrs. M.\nas his \u201csource\u201d and stated that he considered her an \u201copen, unwitting source.\u201d  He\ncontends that even though he had not yet opened a local source file on her, he\nconsidered Mrs. M a \u201csource\u201d.  He admits, however, that she never provided him with\nany information, that he never asked her for any information concerning an ongoing\ninvestigation, and that he did not list her as an \u201copen source\u201d in the USACIDC ACIRS\nsource program.  He denied identifying her as a source in an attempt to receive special\nconsideration.  (See Government Exhibit 7).  \nIn May 2001, Mrs. M.\u2019s husband e-mailed USACIDC, his concerns about an\nimproper relationship he believe existed between the Applicant and his wife.  Mrs. M.\u2019s\nhusband also claimed that the Applicant assisted his wife with the incident at the PX\nand also stated that the Applicant had provided his wife with his Government calling\ncard so that she could contact the Applicant when he was out of town.  This e-mail from\nMrs. M.\u2019s husband prompted the investigation into the Applicant\u2019s affairs.  When the\nApplicant learned of the investigation, he contacted Mr. M. and requested a meeting at\nthe Applicant\u2019s apartment.  During the meeting, the Applicant was said to have\nthreatened  Mr. M. by asking him to withdraw his complaint to USACIDC regarding his\nimproper relationship with Mr. M.\u2019s wife.  The Applicant was also said to have\nthreatened  Mr. M. with a Mexican police report that he had received from Mrs. M\u2019s\nbrother.  The incident concerned a situation that occurred between Mrs. M and her\nhusband while they were in Mexico.  The Applicant told Mr. M. that he had checked with\nhis FBI friends and determined that the incident in Mexico could be considered a\nkidnaping and an international incident that could have consequences.  After the\nApplicant made these threats, Mr. M. called the Special Agent in Charge of the\nApplicant\u2019s investigation and asked him to stop the investigation.  He later recanted,\nstating that his request to stop the investigation had been due, in part, to the Applicant\u2019s\nthreats to blackmail him.  (See Government Exhibit 7).    \nArmy investigative reports further disclose that the Applicant made 28 personal\nphone calls, or otherwise unauthorized phone calls to Mrs. M. over a five month period\nbetween January 2001 and May 2001, using his United States Government issued\ntelephone calling card.  Applicant has no recollection of using his Government card for\nany personal matters.  He stated that he gave Mrs. M. his personal MCI calling card to\nuse to make calls to him.  (See Government Exhibit 7).\nAs a result of these allegations and the ensuing investigation, on July 18, 2001,\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information was suspended.  On December 10, 2001,\nthe Applicant was terminated from his employment at USACIDC.  As a result of this\nalleged misconduct, his security clearance was suspended, and he was terminated from\nhis job.  (See Government Exhibits 5 and 7).     \nSince February 2007, the Applicant has been employed as a contract\ninvestigator conducting personnel security background investigations on behalf of a\ngovernment agency.  In this capacity, he states that he has conducted 260 background\n\n4\ninvestigations from March 1, 2007, through February 2009.  (See Applicant\u2019s Reply to\nthe FORM dated March 6, 2009).  Applicant\u2019s most current performance evaluation\ndated September 25, 2008, reflects ratings of \u201cabove average\u201d in all categories, except\none that is rated \u201csuperior\u201d.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 24).  \nLetters from the Chief of a United States government agency and from a\nsupervisor of the same agency, both dated February 11, 2009, who have known the\nApplicant professionally for the past two years, state that the Applicant is extremely\nprofessional, courteous, a man of good character, dedicated to his job, and extremely\ntrustworthy and reliable.  They have never had any occasion to question the Applicant\u2019s\nintegrity and they highly recommend him for a position of trust.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n32).    \nA letter from a retired United States Army Lieutenant Colonel dated October 27,\n2008, for whom the Applicant has been taking care of her annuities and revocable trust\nsince 2004, reflects that the Applicant is trustworthy and reliable.  She has entrusted the\nApplicant with her investment of over $600,000.00 and has always found the him to\nkeep her best interests in mind.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 31).  \nApplicant\u2019s military NCO performance evaluations and Senior System Civilian\nEvaluation Reports for the years 1991, 1992, 1999, and 2001 rate the Applicant in every\ncategory as \u201cexcellent\u201d, and with the overall potential for promotion as \u201camong the best\u201d.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 20, 21, 22 and 23).    \nNumerous letters of recommendation from past and current business and\nprofessional associates and friends of the Applicant attest to his high level of integrity,\nprofessionalism, candor, reliability and trustworthiness.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 30).  \nDuring both his military and professional business career, the Applicant received\nnumerous  awards, and commendations for his extraordinary service.  His military\nawards include, but are not limited to the Army Achievement Medal, the Army\nCommendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Army Southwest Asia\nService Medal with 3 service stars, and the Army NCO Professional Development\nRibbon.  He has also received many Certificates of Achievement.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits 16, 17, 19 and 33).\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent guidelines.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\n\n5\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\nofficial government representative;\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: . . . (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\n\n6\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's questionable personal conduct has a direct\nand negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  \n\n7\nThe Applicant denies that he rendered false statements to the military police,\nspecifically that he told police that Mrs. M. was his \u201csource\u201d in an attempt to gain favor\nfor her.  He denies that he threatened Mr. M. with a Mexican Police Report or in any\nother fashion.  He also denies ever using a United States Government issued calling\ncard to place 28 personal telephone calls.  There is significant evidence in the record to\nthe contrary.  Records from the Department of the Army criminal investigation of the\nmatter indicate that the Applicant engaged in this misconduct, and as a result, his\nsecurity clearance was suspended and he was terminated from his employment.  Seven\nyears later, the Applicant still denies the misconduct and will not admit to his\nwrongdoing.  He refuses to take responsibility for his past inappropriate actions.  Thus,\nhis behavior is not mitigated by the passage of time and continues to cast doubt on his\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.    \nIt is recognized that the Applicant has many outstanding achievements that\ninclude his exceptional service to the United States reflected by his numerous military\ndecorations, awards and accomplishments, letters of appreciation and recommendation,\nas well as the fact that he volunteered and served in the Middle East in support of\nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  His favorable character reference from his\ncurrent supervisor has also been considered.  However, under the particular\ncircumstances of this case, the fact that the Applicant continues to deny the incidents of\nmisconduct places his credibility in serious question.       \n     \nWith respect to the Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, Under Guideline E,\nDisqualifying Conditions 16.(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative and, 16.(d) credible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not\nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . .\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior. . . apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are\napplicable.\n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, Applicant\u2019s behavior is not mitigated\nby his favorable evidence.  Applicant has not come clean with the Government\nconcerning these incidents, and therefore he cannot be trusted to properly safeguard\nclassified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome\nthe Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 9, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 2, Criminal Justice Information Sheet, and Applicant Exhibit F, Circuit Court\n1\nRecord, reflect that the final disposition of this case was nolle prosequi rather than an acquittal at trial.  \n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 12, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof the Guideline J mitigating conditions is erroneous; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the\nGuideline G disqualifying conditions is erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nis unsupported by the record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 28-year-old systems\nanalyst for a Defense contractor.  In February 2002, Applicant worked at a sporting goods store.  A\nco-worker accused him of stealing a pair of shoes.  He was charged with petit theft and acquitted at\ntrial, at which he \u201capparently produced receipts for the items.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Two years later,\nApplicant was arrested for DUI.  He pled \u201cno contest\u201d and was sentenced to six months probation\nand  80 hours of community service.  His drivers license was suspended.  His probation ended in\nFebruary 2005.  In February 2004 Applicant was charged with battery committed on his girlfriend.\nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend denied that she had been hit and Applicant was acquitted at trial.1\nIn April 2006 Applicant was involved in an automobile accident.  The police suspected that\nApplicant had been drinking.  After performing a field sobriety test, the police charged Applicant\nwith DUI.  He was taken to the police station and asked to take a breathalyzer test.  He refused to\nsubmit to the test.  His case was dismissed through lack of evidence.  The following May Applicant\nwas charged with disorderly conduct arising from an incident involving his girlfriend and another\nwoman.  Both Applicant and his girlfriend had been drinking, although Applicant later claimed that\nhe was drinking cola.  Applicant pled \u201cno contest\u201d and was fined.\nAlthough Applicant continues to consume alcohol, he denies that he does so to excess.  He\nhas never been diagnosed as having an alcohol problem.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\n\n3\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nIn her brief, Department Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s decision did not take into account\ncontrary record evidence.  The Board will address this argument in the discussion below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s decision does not take sufficient stock of\ncontrary record evidence.  This argument is persuasive.  Department Counsel cites to instances of\ninconsistent statements by Applicant that undermine his credibility and vitiate his case for mitigation.\n\n\u201cAn Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to accept an applicant\u2019s explanation about a matter cannot exclusively\n2\nturn on a Judge\u2019s assessment of Applicant\u2019s demeanor when Applicant testifies.  Rather, the Administrative Judge must\nmake findings of fact that reflect careful consideration of pertinent record evidence including record evidence that\nreasonably detracts from the Administrative Judge\u2019s reasoning . . . not just record evidence that supports those findings\nof fact.\u201d  Department Counsel Br. at 12, citing, inter alia, ISCR Case No. 99-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2000)\nconcerning a Judge\u2019s obligation to take into account contrary record evidence in arriving at his findings of fact.\n4\nConcerning the 2002 theft allegation, for example, Applicant denied that he committed the crime,\npointing to his acquittal as substantiation.  However, Government Exhibit (GE) 8 is a handwritten\nstatement by Applicant, made at the time of the alleged theft, in which he admitted to the offense.\nAt the hearing he stated that he had made the statement in the presence of the store manager and\nassistant manager.  \u201cI wrote this statement so I could leave because . . . I didn\u2019t want to be in that\natmosphere.\u201d  Tr. at 19.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not sufficiently address GE 8, either as evidence\nof the underlying offense or as an inconsistent statement which impugns Applicant\u2019s credibility.\nAlthough Applicant was acquitted at trial, a DOHA administrative hearing is not bound by the same\npresumptions and burden of proof applicable to criminal prosecutions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-\n0119 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 1999) (\u201c[T]he fact that criminal charges were dropped, dismissed, or\nresulted in an acquittal does not preclude an Administrative Judge from finding an applicant engaged\nin the conduct underlying those criminal charges.\u201d)  Failure to address this contrary record evidence\nundermines the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusion.  \nThe record contains evidence of another apparently inconsistent statement by Applicant.  GE\n3, Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories, contains a summary of his subject interview.  Concerning\nthe May 2006 disorderly conduct charge, Applicant is reported as having advised the investigator\nthat \u201che and [girlfriend] were at a local nightclub . . . and both of them had been drinking.  He was\nnot intoxicated, but he believes [girlfriend] was somewhat intoxicated . . .\u201d  The next to last page of\nthis exhibit consists of a handwritten and signed statement by Applicant attesting to the accuracy of\nthe investigator\u2019s summary.  In this handwritten statement Applicant describes some of the events\nwhich underlay the allegation of disorderly conduct, but he never attempts to clarify or correct the\nmeaning of the term \u201cdrinking.\u201d  Nevertheless, at the hearing, under cross-examination, Applicant\nclaimed that he had been drinking only soft drinks and denied having consumed alcohol.  Applicant\nattributed the implication that he had consumed alcohol to the investigator.  Tr. at 35.  (\u201cQ: You said\nthat . . . both of you had been drinking.  A: This is what the investigator wrote.\u201d) When a person\nstates that he had been drinking at a nightclub, the fair implication is that he had been consuming\nalcohol.  When Applicant denies the consumption of alcohol only after receiving a SOR alleging\nGuideline G security concerns, a reasonable person could believe that his denial was merely self-\nserving, especially, as in this case, where Applicant has a prior DUI conviction on his record.  This\napparent contradiction is of sufficient significance to merit some discussion in the Judge\u2019s decision.\nWhile the Judge did describe Applicant\u2019s testimony in a footnote to his decision, he did not discuss\nthe apparent inconsistency between the testimony and the subject interview in the context of an\nevaluation of Applicant\u2019s credibility and, specifically, why the found Applicant\u2019s testimony on this\nmatter to be truthful.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument that he substituted a favorable impression of\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence is, therefore, persuasive.   The Judge\u2019s failure to address\n2\nthis aspect of the case undermines his favorable decision.  \n\nDirective \u00b6 15.  Conduct raising a Guideline E security concern includes \u201cany failure to provide truthful and\n3\ncandid answers during the security clearance process.\u201d \n5\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge did not take into account other\ncontrary record evidence, specifically the police reports underlying his battery charge and his second\nDUI.  These reports describe the circumstances of the two charges in detail and provide the names\nand badge numbers of the reporting officers.  Concerning the battery, the officer stated that several\nwitnesses told him that they had seen Applicant strike Applicant\u2019s girlfriend.  The officer further\nstated that he himself saw a red mark on the girlfriend\u2019s face and \u201ca drop of blood on her nose.\u201d  GE\n5, Offense Report, dated February 2, 2004.  The other report contains a description of the 2006 DUI\ncharge.  In this document the policeman stated, inter alia, that Applicant admitted that he had been\ndrinking prior to an automobile accident.  The report describes Applicant as \u201cstaggering across the\nroadway\u201d and that he had a \u201cstrong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and\nperson.\u201d   The report also describes Applicant\u2019s inability to comply with directions during a field\nsobriety test.  GE 6, Offense Incident Report, dated April 2, 2006.  These two reports are difficult\nto reconcile with Applicant\u2019s denial of wrongful conduct.  Under the facts of this case, it was\nincumbent upon the Judge to discuss the police reports and, if he discounted their contents, explain\nwhy.  The Judge\u2019s decision leaves the reader under the impression that Applicant\u2019s testimony and\nthe police reports of the incidents are equally objective.  Given the fact that there are multiple events\nand police reports by different police officers from different jurisdictions, the Judge\u2019s conclusion is\nnot sustainable.  The fact that charges in both cases were dropped is not, in and of itself, a reason to\nbelieve that two different police officers, on separate occasions in different cities, prepared reports\nfalsely implicating Applicant in criminal misconduct.  The decision as it stands does not reflect that\nthe Judge considered the record as a whole; rather, he appears to have considered each SOR incident\nin isolation.  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006); ISCR Case No. 05-00488\nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 1007).  This undermines his favorable decision.\nThe Judge himself appears to have recognized the difficulties which Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances posed to his efforts to obtain a clearance.  Although mitigating the Guidelines J and\nG security concerns, the Judge stated that \u201csome reservations may have remained had the SOR cited\nto issues regarding personal conduct[.]\u201d Decision at 8-9.   In other words, the Judge intimated that,\nhad the SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline E, which addresses \u201c[c]onduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations,\u201d  he might have decided the case differently.  The Directive authorizes a Judge to amend\n3\na SOR \u201cso as to render it in conformity with the evidence admitted[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17.  If, as\nis apparently the case here, a Judge believes that an applicant\u2019s case raises security concerns other\nthan those alleged, he or she can, sua sponte, amend the SOR, granting either party (or both parties)\nadditional time to prepare, as appropriate.  On the one hand the Directive\u2019s language regarding\namendment of the SOR is permissive.  On the other hand, in this instance the Judge, by failing to\nmove to amend the SOR, allowed a situation to stand wherein the record evidence gave him doubts\nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility, and he felt that the issues which presented those doubts were not before\nhim.  Under Egan, doubts must be resolved in favor of national security.  \n\n6\nNormally, the proper disposition of this case would be to remand it to the Judge with\ninstructions to amend the SOR to include Guideline E and to give the parties an opportunity to\naddress that Guideline.  However, the judge\u2019s favorable analysis under Guidelines G and J is not\nsustainable, in light of the record evidence as a whole.  Therefore, no purpose would be served by\nremanding the case.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is not sustainable\non this record.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On October 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nregarding criminal conduct (Guideline J) and alcohol consumption (Guideline G). The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn October 28, 2008, Applicant signed a notarized document in which he\nadmitted one of five allegations under Guideline J and failed to admit or deny the sole\nallegation raised under Guideline G. He also requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on December 9, 2008, and I was\nassigned the case on January 9, 2009. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a\nMarch 12, 2009\n\n Tr. 18-20; Ex. G (2002 Court Record) at 1.\n    1\n Tr. 20.\n    2\n Id.\n    3\n2\nFebruary 4, 2009, hearing date. A notice to that effect was issued by DOHA on January\n16, 2009. \nThe hearing was timely convened. As a preliminary matter, it was noted that the\nSOR incorrectly cited to the counties in which allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e took\nplace. The parties agreed to the removal of the reference to counties in those\nallegations. Consequentially, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a and 1.b in addition to\nallegation 1.c, to which he admitted previously. He also entered a denial to allegation 2\nregarding alcohol consumption. Department Counsel introduced eight documents,\naccepted into the record as exhibits (Exs.) 1-8 without objection. Applicant was\naccompanied by his wife and infant daughter. Applicant gave testimony, his wife\nappeared as a witness, and he was given until February 16, 2009, to submit any\ndocuments for consideration. Seven documents in a package dated February 6, 2009,\nwere received by Department Counsel and reviewed. With no objections, I accepted\nthem into the record as Exs. A-G upon my receipt of the documents on February 12,\n2009. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 19, 2009, and the record was\nclosed. Based upon a review of the limited case file and exhibits presented, Applicant\nmitigated security concerns. Clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 28-year-old systems analyst employed by a Defense contractor.\nHe had a high school diploma and attended some college. Appellant is married. The\ncouple recently had a child. He has two older children from a prior relationship. \nIn February 2002, Applicant worked at a sporting goods store. A co-worker\nreported that he had stolen a pair of shoes. The police were called. Applicant was\ncharged with petit theft. At trial, the government presented its case. Applicant argued he\nhad paid for the shoes and apparently produced receipts for the items. The jury found\nhim not guilty.  Department Counsel concedes that the SOR allegations notes the\n1\nverdict: \u201cSir, the allegation itself indicates that after a jury trial he was acquitted. So the\nGovernment doesn\u2019t \u2013 \u2013 agrees that he was acquitted or acknowledges he was\nacquitted, so that\u2019s not a concern of the Government. It\u2019s the underlying conduct that he\ncommitted that resulted in the arrest.\u201d  With regard to the relevance of the not guilty\n2\nverdict, Department Counsel concluded that \u201cthe Government\u2019s concern is just because\nsomeone is found not guilty . . . not guilty does not translate to innocence.\u201d3\nApplicant was inebriated when he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence\n(DUI) of alcohol on or about January 11, 2004. He pled no contest, was sentenced to\nsix months probation, 80 hours of community service, and had his driver\u2019s license\n\n Ex.

As noted by Department Counsel, \u201cThe Government does not know\n    11\nwhy it was dismissed, the incident was dismissed. Again, it\u2019s not for DOHA hearings to litigate that.\u201d Tr. 54.\n In an interview with investigators, Applicant stated that \u201cboth of them had been drinking.\u201d Ex. 3\n    12\n(Interrogatories) at 3. W hat he had been drinking is not specified. At hearing, he denied \u201cdrinking,\u201d as in\n\u201cdrinking alcohol.\u201d Rather, he suggested that he may have been drinking cola since he was the designated\ndriver and they were at the club for about two hours. Tr. 35-37. \n3\nsuspended for six months. Applicant completed all ordered requirements and his\nprobation ended on February 3, 2005.4\nIn February 2004, Applicant was moving into a new house with a female\nroommate. His girlfriend, now wife, was helping him unpack. She and the female\nroommate had words, and Applicant took his then-girlfriend aside to calm her down.\nThe police were summoned. One of the people present told police that Applicant had\nstruck his girlfriend.  Both Applicant and his girlfriend were arrested and taken to\n5\nheadquarters. Applicant\u2019s then-girlfriend denied being hit, but the police arrested him for\nBattery \u2013 Touch or Strike.  At trial, Applicant was found not guilty of the charge. \n6\nOn April 2, 2006,  Applicant finished an auto detailing job which he occasionally\n7\ndid to supplement his income. On his way home, he was in a car accident which totaled\nhis car. The extent of the damage left him thoroughly distraught. The police thought he\nwas intoxicated, noting alcohol could be smelled. He felt he was not inebriated.  He was\n8\ngiven a field sobriety test, which Applicant assumed he passed. Instead, he was\ncharged with DUI. He was taken to the police station where he was eventually asked to\ntake a Breathalyzer test. Applicant refused, stating that he should have been\nadministered the test contemporaneously with his arrest, not after a long delay.  In the\n9\npolice report, the officer noted that he smelled alcohol.  A few weeks later, he\n10\nappeared before the Department of Transportation to see if he could keep his driver\u2019s\nlicense pending trial. His request was granted. In August 2007, the case was set for\ntrial. At court, the charge was dismissed for lack of evidence.  \n11\nOn or about May 27, 2006, Applicant got home around 6:30 p.m. He and his\nformer girlfriend, now wife, went out around 10 p.m. to meet friends at a club. Both of\nthem had drinks.  Applicant was not intoxicated. Appellant\u2019s girlfriend and another\n12\nfemale had words. Applicant steered his girlfriend away, hoping to end the escalating\n\n Tr. 33.\n    13\n Tr. 32.\n    14\n4\nexchange. Both Applicant and his girlfriend were charged with disorderly conduct.\nApplicant pled no contest and was fined.\nApplicant concedes one of the allegations involved alcohol \u2013 specifically, the\nJanuary 2004 DUI. He does not dispute that he was under the influence. He continues\nto consume alcoholic beverages, but denies over-consumption of alcohol.  \u201c. . . I\n13\nwouldn\u2019t say I have a problem with alcohol. But, you know, on occasion, you know, I do\ndrink a beer or two.\u201d  Applicant last had beer while watching the Superbowl. He usually\n14\nhas a couple of light beers on Fridays and Saturdays. He has never been diagnosed\nwith having an alcohol problem. He regrets the incident and has no intention of driving\nafter consuming alcohol.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n16\n17\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n18\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n19\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nand Guideline F (Financial Considerations) to be the most pertinent to the case.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. With respect to Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), the Government has established its case. Applicant admits he was convicted\nof Disorderly Conduct in 2006, arrested for suspicion of DUI in 2006, and pled no\ncontest to DUI in 2004. The record also shows he was arrested for suspicion of battery\n\n Although an acquittal may not \u201ctranslate to innocence,\u201d it does provide evidence that the appropriate legal\n    20\ntribunal determined that Applicant\u2019s guilt had not been established. \n6\nin 2004 and of petit theft in 2002. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC)\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d) apply.\nIn 2002, a jury acquitted Applicant of the charge of petit theft, SOR allegation\n1.e. In 2004, he was acquitted of battery, as noted at SOR allegation 1.d. An arrest is\nsufficient to raise criminal conduct security concerns and initiate inquiry. Verdicts of not\nguilty, however, speak highly in favor of the Applicant. Moreover, these incidents\noccurred five to seven years ago. Therefore, with regard to these two allegations,\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies, as does AG \u00b6 32(c) (\u201cevidence\nthe person did not commit the act\u201d).  \n20\nAs for SOR allegation 1.a (Disorderly Conduct), the 2006 incident to which\nApplicant pled no contest, Applicant and member(s) of his party may have been\ndisorderly, but it was his intent to bring order to a conflict between his then-girlfriend\nand another woman. Rather than fight a relatively minor charge, he pled no contest.\nThe incident occurred nearly three years ago. Since that time, Applicant and the young\nwoman married and have become parents. He has found stable employment which he\nenjoys and where he has earned the support of his employer, which sponsored his\napplication for a security clearance. Given his intention at the time of the incident and\nsigns of subsequent maturation, AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment\u201d) applies to allegation 1.a. \nSOR allegation 1.c (DUI), to which Applicant pled guilty, and SOR allegation 1.b\n(DUI), a charge which was dismissed, occurred in 2004 and 2006. As for the former,\nApplicant satisfied all court ordered requirements by 2005. In the latter situation,\nApplicant maintained his innocence. The evidence shows a clear division between\nApplicant\u2019s credible testimony about the event and the notes of the police officer\ninvolved. There is no objective evidence indicating which side is correct or more\ncredible. The Government, however, made the decision not to prosecute or the court\ndismissed the charge sua sponte. A dismissal is generally indicative of a situation in\nwhich it is decided that the state does not have a strong enough case to obtain a\nconviction. With DUIs, such a situation often results in a reduction of the charge to\nreckless driving or some similar charge. Here, however, there is no indication Applicant\nwas even cited for the accident. With regard to the dismissed DUI cited at SOR\nallegations 1.b, AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\n\n Regarding the May 2006 incident of disorderly conduct, Applicant\u2019s interviews elude to he and his girlfriend\n    21\nhaving something to drink at a club. Department Counsel makes a not illogical jump and equates drink with\nalcoholic beverage. Applicant testified, however, that if he had anything to drink, it would have been a cola.\nReading the interviews, one cannot discern what he was drinking. Given his credible testimony, his recent\nbrush with the law in April 2006, and all the record facts, however, the evidence tilts in his favor.  \n7\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) applies, as does AG \u00b6 32(c) (\u201cevidence the person did not commit the act\u201d). \nWith regard to SOR allegation 1.c (DUI), Applicant was convicted of DUI. He\nwas, however, permitted to keep his license for business purposes pending trial. Within\na year of his conviction, he had completed all court-ordered requirements. He has\nexpressed his regret over the incident and his intention never to drink and drive again.\nOther than an unproven charge of DUI in 2006 which was ultimately dismissed, there\nhave been no other alcohol-related or otherwise unmitigated criminal incidents. Since\nthat time he has married. The couple has since had a baby. Applicant holds a\nresponsible position which he enjoys. Given these facts and other indications of\nmaturation,  CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation,\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement\u201d) applies.\nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Here, Appellant pled no contest to the charge\nof DUI in January 2004. He was sentenced to six months probation, 80 hours of\ncommunity service, and had his driver\u2019s license suspended for six months. Two years\nlater, in April 2006, Applicant was arrested for DUI. In that situation, however, Applicant\ndid not enter a guilty plea or a non contest plea. The facts remain in conflict between\nApplicant and the arresting officer\u2019s report. Applicant was subject to a field sobriety test\nbut did not take a Breathalyzer test. No objective evidence exists indicating inebriation.\nHe was granted use of his license pending trial. At trial, the matter was dismissed for\nsome unknown reason. There is little to no evidence that alcohol was a contributing\nfactor in the other allegations at issue.21\nAlcohol Consumption security concerns arise based on certain conditions.\nMultiple alcohol-related incidents (e.g., Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition\n(AC DC) AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while\nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent)) or other evidence of an alcoholic nature (e.g., AC DC AG\n\u00b6 22(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional [e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist] of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence)). Here, we have\na singular alcohol-related incident that has been established. It stands alone despite an\narrest and charge which was ultimately dismissed by a court of law. Applicant credibly\n\n Although the 2006 Disorderly Conduct incident somewhat resembles the earlier battery charge, there is\n    22\nno need to further examine these two incidents in light of the findings below.\n8\ntestified that his use of alcohol is generally moderate and that he is more careful since\nreceiving his DUI. There is no indication that he has been determined to be an abuser\nor dependent of alcohol. Consequently, no AC DC is raised and related security\nconcerns are sustained. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors.\nApplicant is a young, but maturing and intelligent man who, in the past seven years, has\nbeen arrested five times. The earliest two of those arrests resulted in acquittals, are not\nrecent, and have only a tenuous nexus to any of the subsequent incidents.  Of larger\n22\nconcern is the 2004 DUI conviction. He completed his sentence requirements in 2005,\nfour years ago. Viewed within the context of these distinct facts, four years without\nfurther incident could prove sufficient to dispel remaining security concerns regarding\nthis conviction. \nSince that conviction, however, Applicant was again arrested for DUI in 2006\nfollowing an accident. The charge, however, was dismissed and he was not tried on any\nlesser charges nor cited for the accident, itself. Consequently, there is no evidence that\nApplicant was guilty of any criminal conduct. \nWith the exception of the 2004 DUI, Applicant seems to be an individual with a\nknack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or with the wrong people. Now in\nhis late 20s, Applicant has matured considerably. His testimony was direct and candid.\nIn the past couple of years, he married. The couple has an infant child.

Crowley, Esquire, Chief Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on May 24, 2007. On July 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H that provided the basis for its decision to deny him\na security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 20, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September\n26, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n2\ncontinue a security clearance for him. On November 13, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for\nDecember 1, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Four government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and five\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-E) were admitted without any objections and Applicant\ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on December 11, 2008.\nBased on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant used\nmarijuana with varying frequency from February 1997 through May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a),\npurchased marijuana from at least December 2002 through May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b),\nused Ritalin at least 35 to 40 times from May 2006 through April 2007 when it was not\nprescribed for him (SOR \u00b6 1.c), used \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d at least once in May 2003\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) and used opium at least once in June 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant\nadmitted the allegations but denied any intent to repeat the behavior. After considering\nthe evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old senior product design engineer who has been\nemployed by a defense contractor since October 2006 (Ex. 1). He is seeking a secret\nclearance for his duties (Ex. B).\nApplicant started smoking marijuana in about February 1997, at the beginning of\nhis second semester in college in state X. He used the drug throughout the remainder of\nhis undergraduate study, usually at parties about once a month (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 40). In\nMay 2000, he was awarded his bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering.\nThat summer, he remained at the college, working on his graduate research (Ex. 1).\nIn September 2000, he began master\u2019s degree studies at a university in a large\ncity in state X where illegal drugs were more easily accessible. While in graduate\nschool, he continued to smoke marijuana at a somewhat higher frequency than in\ncollege, \u201cmainly for relaxation purposes in the comfort of [his] own home.\u201d (Ex. 1, Tr.\n40).  He purchased the drug through friends (Tr. 41). In June 2002, he tried opium while\non a weekend trip visiting friends (Tr. 46).\nAfter earning his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in December 2002, he\nbegan pursuing his doctorate in the same discipline at the same university (Ex. 1, Tr.\n38). In late March 2003, Applicant and his spouse married (Ex. 1, Tr. 39). He continued\nto smoke marijuana. In May 2003, he tried hallucinogenic mushrooms out of curiosity\none weekend while visiting a friend (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 46).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse brought some debt into the marriage that they were not able\nto satisfy on their income. Applicant had a small stipend as a graduate research\nassistant at the university. Yet, they managed to qualify for a mortgage, and bought a\n\nApplicant was eventually awarded his doctorate degree in electrical engineering, although there is\n1\ndiscrepant information about the date. On his e-QIP (Ex. 1), he indicated the degree was awarded in June\n2007. At his hearing, he testified he received his degree about two weeks before he started work in October\n2006 (Tr. 50).\nThere is no evidence that Applicant ever took a drug screen for his job.\n2\nApplicant cannot recall whether he read the employee handbook by which the policy information is\n3\ndisseminated to employees, or whether he just assumed his employer would have a drug policy (Tr. 49). \n3\nhome in state X in about September 2003. In February 2004, his spouse stopped\nworking on the birth of their first child (Ex. 1, Tr. 39). She subsequently pursued a\ncareer in real estate for a short time until she became pregnant with twins, who were\nborn in September 2006 (Ex. 1, Tr. 39). \nApplicant continued to smoke marijuana at home after the birth of his first\ndaughter and while his spouse was pregnant with their twins. In about May 2006, he\nstarted using Ritalin, which had been prescribed for his spouse to treat her attention\ndeficit disorder (ADD) (Tr. 42-43). In researching her mental illness and the drug (Tr.\n45), Applicant learned that it increased concentration/focus, and he began taking some\nof her medication so that he could better concentrate on his doctoral thesis (Ex. 1).1\nIn about September 2006, Applicant briefly ceased using marijuana in\nanticipation of a pre-employment drug screen (Ex. 1).  In late October 2006, he began\n2\nworking for the defense contractor in state Y. His employer had a zero tolerance policy\nagainst drug abuse on the job or on company premises and indicated in its employee\nhandbook that drug abuse by employees off the job could result in disciplinary action by\nthe company (Ex. 3).  \nIn November 2006, Applicant and his family moved into temporary housing paid\nfor by his employer near his job in state Y. They were unable to obtain a mortgage for a\nhome in the area due to their poor credit (Ex. 1, Tr. 41). In February 2007, Applicant\u2019s\nspouse and children moved back to their home in state X to prepare the premises for\nsale while Applicant began sharing an apartment near work with a male roommate.\nAlmost every weekend, Applicant drove home, about 500 miles round trip, to see his\nspouse and children. He resumed smoking marijuana on those weekend trips to state X,\nassuming, if not knowing, that his employer would not condone it.  His spouse, who was\n3\nalso using marijuana at that time, sometimes procured the drug for them. Other times,\nhe bought the drug himself (Tr. 52).  Early on Monday mornings, he left his family and\ndrove the 250 miles directly to work in state Y (Tr. 41-42).  From February to April 2007,\nhe ingested some of his spouse\u2019s Ritalin before he left his house in state X to help him\nstay awake during the long drive (Ex. 1, Tr. 41-44). Applicant stopped using the Ritalin\nbecause of remorse/guilt about using a medication not prescribed for him (Tr. 44).\nIn May 2007, Applicant was asked by his employer to apply for a DoD security\nclearance. Applicant informed the facility security officer (FSO) about his use of\n\nThe FSO, who is also familiar with Applicant\u2019s work in his capacity as chief scientist, indicated on\n4\nNovember 14, 2008, that Applicant was up-front about his use of marijuana in college when he was filling out\nhis application for a security clearance. He added that he would not have requested a clearance for him had\nApplicant showed \u201cany tendency or evidence of his using marijuana while employed with our company.\u201d (Ex.\nC). There is no indication that Applicant told the FSO that he had used marijuana and Ritalin since becoming\nan employee of the company.\nApplicant somewhat reluctantly volunteered the details of his spouse\u2019s marijuana involvement. W hen\n5\nasked how he obtained the marijuana he used after October 2006, Applicant indicated that his spouse was\nstill living in state X and had contacts there (\u201cI was able to, when I went down to the weekend, have access\nto it.\u201d). In response to whether his spouse was using marijuana as well at that time, Applicant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow if that\u2019s relevant.\u201d (Tr. 51). Subsequently asked for the number of times that he observed his spouse use\nmarijuana from May 2007 to December 2007, Applicant claimed initially that he could not recall but went on\nto testify that it was \u201capproximately ten times.\u201d (Tr. 60).\n4\nmarijuana in college (Ex. B, Ex. C), and with the FSO\u2019s consent,  Applicant completed\n4\nan e-QIP on May 24, 2007. He was candid about his and his spouse\u2019s financial\ndifficulties, and about his illegal drug involvement. In response to question 24\nconcerning any illegal drug use in the preceding seven years, he indicated he used\nmarijuana \u201cmany\u201d times from about February 1997 to May 2007; often during\nundergraduate school, to relax during graduate school, and after a brief cessation in\nanticipation of a pre-employment drug screen for his present job, on an occasional basis\non weekends after he began working for the defense contractor. He averred that on\nfiling out his e-QIP, he decided to cease use of marijuana. Applicant also disclosed that\nhe used Ritalin about 35 to 40 times between May 2006 and April 2007, initially to\nconcentrate while writing his Ph. D thesis, and since February 2007 to stay awake while\nreturning from visits home to see his family. He also listed his one-time uses of \u201cmagic\nmushrooms\u201d in May 2003 and opium in about June 2002. Applicant listed some debts\nand indicated that at times, he was faced with the choice of buying food or paying the\nbills (Ex. 1). Applicant told his spouse that he had applied for a security clearance. He\ntold her to not get in any trouble, and that they both needed to stop using marijuana (Tr.\n59).\nSometime in summer 2007, Applicant attended a social gathering in state Y\nwhere a friend from state X smoked marijuana. This friend was in the area visiting his\nrelatives, and Applicant had suspicions that their socialization would involve marijuana\n(Tr. 54). Applicant had informed this person in May 2007 not to offer him marijuana in\nthe future because he was applying for a security clearance. Applicant left the premises\nwhile the marijuana was smoked (Tr. 55-56), but his spouse smoked the drug (Tr. 57-\n58). Applicant observed his spouse smoking marijuana on about ten occasions between\nMay 2007, when he asked her to stop using the drug, and December 2007, when they\nmoved to their present residence in state Z (Tr. 58-61).   Applicant asserts, with no\n5\nevidence of record to the contrary, that his spouse ceased her marijuana use in\nDecember 2007 (Tr. 58). As of early December 2008, she was still taking Ritalin (Tr.\n62). \nOn May 20, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator for\nfurther details about his illegal drug involvement. Applicant indicated he stopped using\n\n5\nmarijuana in May 2007 because he did not want to lose his job (\u201cI do not intend to use\nmarijuana again. The temptation is there but there are more important things to do, and\nI have children. I want to set a good example for them.\u201d). Applicant detailed his use of\nRitalin in 2007 and denied any intent to use Ritalin again unless it was prescribed for\nhim. Applicant indicated that his spouse, siblings, and friends are aware of his previous\ndrug involvement so it could not be used against him (Ex. 2).\nApplicant and his spouse have been in marital counseling with a clinical\npsychologist since June 2008. After it was pointed out that some of his symptoms were\ncommon to a diagnosis of ADD, the clinical psychologist referred Applicant for a\npsychiatric evaluation. ADD was ruled out in favor of a depressive disorder (Ex. E, Tr.\n35). As of early December 2008, Applicant was in treatment with the clinical\npsychologist to relieve his mild depression (Tr. 37, 66).\nAt his hearing, Applicant submitted a written statement of intent not to use or\npurchase an illegal drug or to misuse a prescription drug again with the full\nunderstanding that any security clearance he held would be automatically revoked for\nany violation (Ex. D). He wants to be a good role model for his children and to retain the\njob that he loves (Tr. 47). About once or twice a year, Applicant socializes with those\nfriends from state X with whom his spouse used marijuana in summer 2007 (Tr. 56).\nApplicant was hired by his employer to work on a new sensor system involving\ninfrared laser technology. During the past two years, he has fully lived up to his\nemployer\u2019s expectations, and has demonstrated an ability to interact with various\nfunctional groups. The maturity of his approach to the job and responsiveness to\norganizational needs led to unsolicited praise from several senior managers (Ex. A, Ex.\nB).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concerns about drug involvement are set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n\n7\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nApplicant began using marijuana during his freshman year of college at parties.\nHe continued to smoke the drug while in graduate school to relax, at times with his\nspouse, and he purchased the drug on occasion through friends. While he stopped\nsmoking for a brief period in anticipation of a drug screen for his job in fall 2006, he\nresumed smoking marijuana on weekends until May 2007.  He also abused Ritalin while\nworking on his doctoral thesis, and again from February 2007 to April 2007, taking it to\nstay awake while driving back from visits to his spouse and children. He estimates that\nover the 2006/07 time frame, he ingested Ritalin that had not been prescribed for him\non about 35 to 40 occasions. Applicant also tried opium in June 2002, and\nhallucinogenic mushrooms in May 2003 out of curiosity.  AG 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d\nand AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d apply.\nConcerning potential factors in mitigation under Guideline H, Applicant\u2019s\ninvolvement with opium and hallucinogenic mushrooms was \u201cso infrequent\u201d as to fall\nwithin AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is likely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d However, AG \u00b6 26(a)\ncannot reasonably be applied to his overall drug involvement, given his ten years of\nmarijuana use and abuse of Ritalin about 35 to 40 times over about one year.\nAt his hearing, Applicant furnished the statement required for AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (4) a signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6\n26(b)(4) applies, but it is only one factor to consider in assessing the risk of future\nabuse. Marijuana was a significant part of Applicant\u2019s recreational lifestyle for some ten\nyears. He obviously enjoyed the drug\u2019s effects, and he and his spouse continued to\nsmoke even after the births of their three children and despite significant financial\nproblems. On his e-QIP, he indicated that at times, he had to choose between paying\nthe bills and buying food. Yet, these financial difficulties did not stop him from\npurchasing  marijuana. He gave little thought to the illegality of using his spouse\u2019s Ritalin\nwithout a prescription on many occasions. Concerned that he could test positive in a\npre-employment drug screen for his current job, Applicant stopped smoking marijuana\nfor a brief period in fall 2006. However, after he was secure in his position, he resumed\nhis involvement with marijuana. From February to April 2007, he again abused Ritalin\non the weekends.\nApplicant resolved in May 2007 to abstain from all future illegal drug use,\nincluding any use of controlled substances not prescribed for him. A demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future can be shown by \u201can appropriate period of\nabstinence\u201d (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(3)). The frequency and duration of previous abuse are\n\n8\nfactors to consider in assessing whether the term of abstinence is sufficient to\nguarantee against recurrence. Applicant\u2019s present abstinence of some 18 months is not\ninsignificant, although it is relatively short when compared to his years of marijuana\nabuse. Moreover, a friend aware that Applicant had to cease his drug use for his job\nnonetheless pulled out marijuana at a social function attended by Applicant and his\nspouse in summer 2007. Applicant had suspicions that marijuana would be present at\nthe function and he attended anyway (Tr. 54). Although he showed good judgment in\ntemporarily removing himself from the situation, his spouse smoked the drug on that\noccasion. Furthermore, Applicant was around his wife when she smoked marijuana on\nabout ten occasions between May and December 2007. While he testified he told her\nthat they both needed to cease their involvement with the drug, he condoned her drug\nuse by staying around while she used it.\nApplicant submits that AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs\nare used,\u201d apply in that drugs are no longer part of his or his spouse\u2019s lifestyle since\nthey moved to their present residence in December 2007. There is no evidence that\nApplicant and his spouse socialize with any regularity with their drug-using friends from\nstate X, but they have not completely terminated the relationships (\u201cEvery now and\nagain, we\u2013they\u2019re in the area for some family events, so we see them occasionally,\nonce or twice a year at most.\u201d Tr. 56). Without the opportunity to assess Applicant\u2019s\nspouse\u2019s commitment to remaining drug free, I cannot fully apply AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), AG \u00b6\n26(b)(2), or AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). As recently as May 2008, Applicant acknowledged to a\ngovernment investigator that the temptation is there to use marijuana, and Ritalin is\nreadily available in the home. He now denies any desire to use marijuana (\u201cThere\u2019s no\nphysical or emotional\u2013what do I want to say\u2013binding with me and marijuana.\u201d Tr. 37) or\nRitalin, but I am unable to conclude based on the available record that his drug abuse is\nsafely in the past.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n9\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant knew when he used the marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms, opium,\nand Ritalin that he was engaging in illegal conduct. Concerned that he would test\npositive for marijuana in any pre-employment screen for his present job, he abstained\nfor a brief period, only to resume his involvement once he was on the company\u2019s\npayroll. He continued to smoke marijuana at home for some seven months, and abused\nRitalin over three months of that time, assuming if not knowing that his employer would\nnot condone that abuse (see AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1), 2(a)(2), 2(a)(3), 2(a)(4), and 2(a)(5)).\nApplicant exhibited some maturation in resolving to give up drugs on applying for a\nclearance, and in candidly disclosing his drug abuse on his e-QIP (see AG \u00b6 2(a)(6)).\nBut he also looked the other way while his spouse continued to smoke marijuana for at\nleast seven more months. His desire to retain his employment and the increasing\nlikelihood of his children being affected by his and his spouse\u2019s conduct in the home are\nnot sufficient to overcome the drug involvement concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On October 31, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On March 27, 2009, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether Department Counsel assigned to the\n\ncase improperly characterized and represented his case to the Judge, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\ndecision is supported by the record evidence.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the\nJudge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found that Applicant acquired ten outstanding past due or charged off debts.  The\nJudge also found that Applicant was unemployed between March and June of 1999, and when he\nfound work again, his pay was substantially less. The Judge acknowledged that this history caused\nApplicant to have financial difficulties. The Judge concluded that the circumstances under which the\ndebts accumulated did not mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns because Applicant has done\nlittle to address his very substantial past due indebtedness.  \nApplicant complains that Department Counsel did not give his financial situation the proper\nrepresentation that it deserved, and Department Counsel failed to present his financial status from\n2003 to the present as being responsible and characterized by the making of on-time payments.\nApplicant claims some confusion as to what his rights in the process were.  Applicant also claims\nthat certain debts were satisfied prior to Department Counsel\u2019s submission of the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) that constituted the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief and attachments reference matters that were not made part of the\nrecord below.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nContrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions, Department Counsel was not responsible for presenting\nevidence wherein Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances would be presented in a light that was\nfavorable to him.  After the issuance of the SOR, DOHA adjudications are adversarial proceedings.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-10347 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 17, 2002).  In this setting, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting his or her case.  The case file shows that Applicant freely chose to have\nhis case determined without a hearing, was provided a copy of the Directive, and was fully apprised\nof his right to submit material that he wished the Judge to consider.  Applicant did not submit any\nresponse to the FORM.  The case file also shows that Applicant was informed of his right to be\nrepresented by an attorney in the preparation of his response to the government\u2019s FORM.  This\nplaced him on reasonable notice that he was responsible for presenting his case, and that neither the\nJudge nor Department Counsel was responsible for assisting him in doing so.  Applicant has failed\nto establish error.     \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to matters in mitigation.\nApplicant\u2019s assertion does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.  The presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at\n2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence,\nor an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \n   \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\n\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the close of the record, Applicant still had substantial delinquent\ndebts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The\nJudge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of\nthe disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions\nand whole-person factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence of mitigation was insufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfs.

On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR soon thereafter.  He answered the\nSOR in writing on November 25, 2008, and requested an Administrative Determination\nby an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) on January 8, 2009.  The Applicant did not respond to the FORM.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 25, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations of all the Subparagraphs of the SOR, with explanations.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant was unemployed from March~June of 1999 (Item 3 at page 5).\nWhen he was re-employed, his pay was substantially less (Id).

I find that\nthis debt remains outstanding.\n1.e.  The fifth debt is a charged off gasoline credit card account in the amount of\nabout $1,282 (Item 5 at page 4).  The Applicant avers that he is \u201c[i]n 3  party\nrd\nnegotiations\u201d regarding this debt, but has provided nothing further (Item 4 at pages\n6~7).  I find that this debt remains outstanding.\n1.f.  The sixth debt is a collection account to a third bank in the amount of about\n$3,204 (Item 5 at page 3).  The Applicant avers that he has \u201cacquired a credit\nconsular(sic) to negotiate\u201d this debt, but has provided nothing further (Item 4 at page 2).\nI find that this debt remains outstanding.\n1.g.

I find that this debt remains outstanding.\n1.i.  The ninth debt is a collection account for another gasoline credit card\naccount in the amount of about $1,734 (Item 5 at page 6).  The Applicant avers that he\nis \u201c[i]n the process of 3  party negotiations\u201d regarding this debt, but has provided\nrd\nnothing further (Item 4 at pages 4).  I find that this debt remains outstanding.\n1.j.  The last debt is a collection account to another utility company in the amount\nof about $347 (Item 5 at page 3).  The Applicant avers that he is \u201c[i]n 3  party\nrd\nnegotiations\u201d regarding this debt, but has provided nothing further (Item 4 at page 5).  I\nfind that this debt remains outstanding.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n4\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG Subparagraph19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations@ may raise security concerns.  Subparagraph 20(b), states that it\nmay be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, . . .), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Here, the Applicant was unemployed in\n1999, and was later employed with a substantial cut in pay; but, other than evidenced\nby his bare averments in response to the Government\u2019s interrogatories, he has done\nlittle to address his very substantial past due indebtedness.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Subparagraph 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n5\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his Financial\nConsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n_________________\nRICHARD A. CEFOLA\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Applicant used methamphetamine, with varying frequency and to the point of addiction, from about 1999 until her last usage in February of 2006 (TR at page 83 lines 4~16).

After her inpatient treatment, she was in an after care program for about two months (TR at page 107 line 9 to page 108 line 9).

Edmunds, Esquire\nDecember 10, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on February 12, 2007.  On May 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines H, E and J for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 2, 2009.  She answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on June 16, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on July 30, 2009, and I received the\ncase assignment the same day.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay until\nSeptember of 2009, in order for her counsel to be available.  DOHA issued a notice of\n\n2\nhearing on August 4, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 16,\n2009.  The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which were received\nwithout objection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf, as did five witnesses, and\nsubmitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through P, and R and S, without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (TR) on September 23, 2009.  The record closed\non September 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant made a general denial of all of the\nallegations.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\n1.a.~1.e.  The Applicant used methamphetamine, with varying frequency and to\nthe point of addiction, from about 1999 until her last usage in February of 2006 (TR at\npage 83 lines 4~16).  Her initial usage was very infrequent, but \u201cit increased to a daily\nhabit at the tail end of 2002 and [the] beginning of 2003\" (TR at page 99 line 23 to page\n101 line 15).  Just before she went into rehabilitation treatment in December of 2003,\nthe Applicant \u201cwas using every day . . . a gram and a half a day at that point\u201d (TR at\npage 102 lines 3~12).\nFrom December of 2003 until January of 2004, the Applicant received inpatient\ntreatment for her addiction (TR at page 83 line 17 to page 84 line 9, and at page 103\nline 4 to page 104 line 9).  After her inpatient treatment, she was in an after care\nprogram for about two months (TR at page 107 line 9 to page 108 line 9).  However,\nabout three months later, the Applicant again began to use methamphetamine (TR at\npage 110 line 16 to page 111 line 1).  This usage continued until her arrest in February\nof 2006, in part, for Possession of a Controlled Substance - Methamphetamine (GX 5).\nAlthough this charge was ultimately dismissed, the Applicant admits possessing the\ndrug (TR at page 111 line 2 to page 113 line 5).  During the period of her usage, the\nApplicant also purchased methamphetamine on numerous occasions, at times spending\nabout $150 a week on the drug (TR at page 101 line 16 to page 102 line 2).\n1.f.~1.i.  During the period of her drug usage, the Applicant also used cocaine,\nmarijuana, Ecstasy (MDMA), and Psilocybin mushrooms, each drug on at least three\nseparate occasions (TR at page 91 line 18 to page 92 line 5, at page 97 line 12 to page\n98 line 14, at page 99 line 6 to page 102 line 2).\nMost recently, in June of 2009, the Applicant submitted a Statement of Intent\n(AppX S).  In that Statement, the Applicant averred the following:\nI.  I am submitting that statement as intent never to never use illegal drugs\nagain.\n\n3\n2.  Should there be any violation with regard to illegal drug use, I hereby\nconsent to automatic revocation of my security clearance (Id).\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n2.a.  Section 23 of Applicant\u2019s February 12, 2007, e-QIP, styled Your Police\nRecord, has the following introductory instructions:\nFor this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your\ncase has been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the court record.  The\nsingle exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the\nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an\nexpungement order . . . (GX 1 at page 36).\nQuestion 23.f. asks \u201c[i]n the last 7 years have you been arrested for, charged\nwith, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, or e above?\u201d (GX 1\nat page 37).  The Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d and listed that she had been arrested for\n\u201cresisting the arrest of a felon\u201d (Id).  She did not list that she was also arrested for\n\u201cPossession of a Controlled Substance - Methamphetamine,\u201d in February of 2007,\nbecause she avers in her subsequent inquiries with the court, where the charge was\ndismissed, she thought her dismissal was a form of expungement (TR at page 92 line\n11 to page 93 line 24, and at page 115 line 13 to page 118 line 6).  This explanation is\nbelievable; and as such, I find no wilful falsification here.\n2.b. and 3.a.  Section 24 of Applicant\u2019s February 12, 2007, e-QIP, styled Your\nUse of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity, posits the following question under\nsubparagraph a.:\nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you\nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine,\ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.),\namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers,\netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? (GX 1 at\npage 38).\nTo which the Applicant checked \u201cYes\u201d, from \u201c02/2001 (Estimated)\u201d to \u201c12/2003\n(Estimated) . . . Methamphetamine,\u201d an \u201cUnknown\u201d number of times, with these\nadditional comments: \u201cI was using a long time and didn\u2019t stop until receiving help in a\nrehabilitation center . . . .\u201d (Id).  I find this to be a wilful falsification, a violation of 18\nU.S.C. Section 1001 (TR at page 131 at line 23 to page 132 line 25).  The Applicant\nused methamphetamine, extensively, after her inpatient treatment in January of 2004,\nuntil her arrest in February of 2006.\n\n4\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n3.b.  The Applicant, admittedly, possessed methamphetamine, when she was\narrested in February of 2006 (TR at page 111 line 2 to page 113 line 5).  This\nconstitutes criminal conduct.\n3.c.  In October of 1998, the Applicant was cited for being a Minor in Possession\nof Alcohol (TR at page 94 line 25 to page 95 line 11, and at page 127 line 7 to page 128\nline 7).  She was 19 years of age, and was fined as a result of this incident (Id).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\n\n5\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nParagraph 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe guideline also notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.\nUnder Subparagraph 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying.  In\naddition,\u201ddiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional . . . of drug abuse or drug\ndependence \u201d under Subparagraph 25(d) may be disqualifying.  Here the Applicant\nused the Applicant used methamphetamine from about 1999 to her arrest in February of\n2006.  Her usage was to the point of addiction, which required inpatient treatment  from\nDecember of 2003 until January of 2004  This is countered, however, by the mitigating\nconditions found in Subparagraphs 26(b)(3) and 26(b)(4).  The Applicant has shown \u201ca\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence;\u201d and \u201c(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\u201d  The Applicant was last involved with methamphetamine in\nFebruary of 2006, nearly four years ago.  She has also signed a letter of intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future.  I find her statement of intent to be credible and sincere.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\n\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom an personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form . . . .\u201d  Here, the Applicant\nfalsified her answer to question 24.a. on her February 2007, e-QIP.  She was involved\nwith and used methamphetamine more than two years after her admitted usage.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Criminal Conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Paragraph 31(c) provides that an \u201callegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted,@ may raise security concerns.  The Applicant was arrested for possessing\nmethamphetamine in February of 2006, and her falsification in answer to question 24.a.\non her e-QIP is also a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  I find no countervailing Mitigating\nConditions that are applicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  The Applicant has the unqualified support\n\n7\nof her father, and of those who know her in the work place (Tr at page 38 line 11 to\npage 74 line 2, and AppXs C, D, H~J, and M~S).  However, the record evidence leaves\nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  She was clearly less than candid with the Government as to the recency of\nher drug abuse.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from her Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, the government\u2019s exhibits (Gx.),\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits (Ax.), and Applicant\u2019s testimony, her request for a security\nclearance is granted.\nOn May 8, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF\n86) to obtain a security clearance required for her job with a defense contractor. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant\n1\naccess to classified information. On October 14, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a\nMarch 26, 2009\n\n The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n She also works for the U.S. Army part-time as a \u201ccivilian on the battlefield\u201d role player, but does not require\n3\na clearance for that job. \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in\nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on February 2, 2009, and I convened a hearing on February 25, 2009.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented seven exhibits included\nin the record without objection as Gx. 1 - 7. Applicant testified and submitted five\nexhibits admitted without objection as Ax. A - E. DOHA received the transcript of\nhearing (Tr.) on March 3, 2009. Additionally, I left the record open after the hearing (Tr.\n62) to receive additional relevant information. The record closed on March 10, 2009,\nwhen I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, which has been admitted without\nobjection as Ax. F.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $23,666\nin delinquent debt. More specifically, it was alleged she owes for three delinquent credit\ncard accounts of $7,581 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $4,800 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and $9,758 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), as\nwell as a $1,500 delinquent tax debt to the IRS (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In response, Applicant\nadmitted the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allegations and denied the others. After reviewing the\npleadings, the transcript, and the parties\u2019 exhibits, I have made the following findings of\nrelevant fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old and works as a human resources assistant for a\ndefense contractor.  Applicant attended a university in her home state between\n3\nSeptember 1994 and December 1999. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in English,\nwith a minor in drama. (Tr. 8) More than 20 personal and professional references\nprovided at hearing attest to Applicant\u2019s integrity, honesty, reliability and willingness to\nwork hard. She is held in high regard by friends and co-workers, and by management\nand the government customers her company supports. (Ax. E)\nApplicant\u2019s wallet was stolen while she was at college on or about July 8, 1997.\nApplicant had left her backpack in a classroom, but when she retrieved it, her wallet and\ncredit cards were missing. (Ax. A) Applicant later figured out who had taken it, but\nreceived no useful assistance from campus police. (Gx. 3; Tr. 39, 47) Before she could\ncancel the cards, several hundred dollars in clothes, restaurant bills, and other\npurchases had been charged to the accounts. (Tr. 47 - 48, 50 - 51) Eventually, the\ncredit card companies agreed that she was not liable for the charges resulting from the\ntheft. However, the relief she received from at least one of the debts became a benefit\nthat was taxable as income. Applicant subsequently incurred a $1,500 debt to the\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS). (Tr. 43 - 44)\n\n Reference to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\u2019s National Hurricane\n4\nCenter website (http://www.katrina.noaa.gov) shows the path of Hurricane Katrina passed directly over\nApplicant\u2019s hometown during the first 24 hours after landfall.\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n3\nApplicant thought this matter was concluded in her favor as of about 2003.\nHowever, any records she had concerning the theft and her efforts to resolve the\nresulting debts was lost when her home was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n(Tr. 40; Ax. F)  She had responded in 2003 or 2004 to overdue notices from at least one\n4\ncreditor, but after advising them the debts were not hers, she heard nothing further\nabout any such delinquencies until she was interviewed by a government investigator in\nSeptember 2007. (Gx. 3)\nAvailable information about Applicant\u2019s character, reliability and trustworthiness is\noverwhelmingly positive. The sources for that information range from lifelong associates\nto co-workers over the past two years. (Ax. E) Applicant\u2019s position in response to the\ngovernment\u2019s allegations is that she is not responsible for any of the debts listed in the\nSOR. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.a because it has been charged off as a business loss. She\ndenied SOR \u00b61.d because it was a result of the charge off of SOR \u00b6 1.a. She admitted\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, but only because the accounts were not listed as charge offs and\nstill active on her credit report. She also acknowledged that there was already a balance\ndue on the card listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c when it was stolen, but she transferred that balance\nto a different card and paid it off by 2003. The balance remaining is what others charged\nwhen they stole her cards. Nonetheless, she maintains she does not owe the debts\nalleged because they were charged by the people who stole her wallet. (Answer to\nSOR; Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr. 41 - 43) \nApplicant\u2019s current personal finances are sound. She has a positive cash flow in\nexcess of $1,000 each month. She does not use credit cards and does not buy anything\nshe cannot pay for outright. For example, she paid her rent under her current lease for\nthe next year up front. As to the IRS debt, Applicant decided to pay it rather than contest\nthe matter. (Ax. C; Ax. F; Tr. 35 - 36) Her bank account shows she had at least $3,500\nin savings and $1,940 in checking at the end of February 2009. (Ax. F)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\n\n5\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.a - 1,d; that is, that there are four debts attributed to Applicant that have been\nunpaid for several years. Applicant admitted two of the allegations, thus relieving the\ngovernment of its burden of proving them as fact. Her denial of the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nand 1.d required the government to present reliable evidence to support those\nallegations. I conclude the record supports those allegations and requires application of\nthe disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response, the burden shifted to Applicant to present sufficient information to\nshow the debts were not hers or to mitigate the security concerns raised by the\ngovernment\u2019s information. Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s information has\nbeen hampered by the passage of time and the intervening natural disaster that\ndestroyed her records. It is apparent that she cannot prove a negative \u2013 that she does\nnot owe the debts listed \u2013 without tangible documentation. I have reviewed the\ninformation about her character contained in Ax. E. I also assessed her demeanor and\ncredibility at the hearing. Applicant\u2019s testimony and her response to questions on cross-\nexamination and  from the bench were given in a straightforward manner without any\napparent attempt to mislead or to avoid responsibility. I find that her version of events,\ncombined with all of the information bearing on this issue, is plausible and supports a\nspecific finding that the debts alleged are not Applicant\u2019s responsibility. I further\nconclude that the combination of the police report and her credible testimony about the\norigin of the debts is sufficient to show the debts attributable to her by the credit reports\nin the record arose through circumstances beyond her control. I also conclude she has\na basis for disputing the validity of the debts. Finally, Applicant is not currently in any\nfinancial difficulty and she manages her finances prudently. She lives well within her\nmeans and has sufficient positive cashflow to avoid future financial problems. \nAll of the foregoing supports application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(a)\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), and AG \u00b6\n20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue). On\nbalance, Applicant presented available information sufficient to show she is unlikely to\nact contrary to the national interest to get money to repay the alleged debt. Available\ninformation is sufficient to mitigate the alleged security concerns about Applicant\u2019s\nfinances. \n\n6\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Available information portrays\nApplicant as a mature, responsible and diligent 37-year-old defense contractor\nemployee. She is well-regarded by her friends and co-workers, most of whom\nspecifically commented on her reputation for honesty and reliability. The persuasive\nvalue of the information she presented to refute the government\u2019s allegations and to\nmitigate the adverse security concerns raised by the government\u2019s evidence relies on\nthe credibility of her testimony. Security determinations require applicants to bear a\nheavy burden in response to the government\u2019s concerns. Reliance on a credibility\nassessment and on circumstantial evidence to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant access to classified information should be the exception rather\nthan the rule. I believe this case is such an exception. Applicant has been candid and\nforthcoming about her finances, and there has been no financial or other misconduct on\nher part. A fair and commonsense evaluation of this record shows that the security\nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s credit history are mitigated, and her finances do not put\nher at risk of acting contrary to the national interest. Any doubts about Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for access to classified information have been satisfied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information. Request for security\nclearance is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant:\nAnthony Camacho, Esq.\nApril 14, 2011\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on April 8, 2007. (Government Exhibit 3.) On March 26, 2010, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), D (Sexual Behavior) and B\n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2010, and requested a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 8, 2010. This case was\nassigned to me on December 13, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 4,\n2011. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 24, 2011. The Government\n\n2\noffered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through P, which were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel requested that the record remain open for the\nadmission of additional documents. On February 14, 2011, Applicant Exhibit Q was\nreceived and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on\nFebruary 9, 2011. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 50 and single. He has been married twice, from May 1981 through\nApril 1988, and July 1988 through December 1991. Applicant has received two\nAssociate of Applied Science degrees. (Applicant Exhibits F and P.) He is employed by\na defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in conduct which displays questionable judgment,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nApplicant admitted without reservation subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR. That\nadmission is deemed a finding of fact. He admitted with reservations the factual\nallegations in subparagraphs 1.f. and 1.h. Applicant denied the remaining\nsubparagraphs.\nApplicant has, on occasion, frequented prostitutes for the purpose of sexual\ngratification. This first occurred in 1980, then in 1991. From 1992 through 1999\nApplicant lived and worked in Saudi Arabia. The opportunities for single Americans to\nhave normal social interactions were very limited. However, as further discussed below\nunder Paragraph 3, from 1995 through 1999 Applicant had a Filipino girlfriend (Ms. A)\nwho was also living and working in Saudi Arabia. During the period before and after he\nwas dating Ms. A, Applicant would visit Thailand. During these visits, he would on\noccasion use the services of a prostitute. Applicant denied that he engaged in this\nactivity on a daily basis while on his visits to Thailand. (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.)\nApplicant also engaged the services of prostitutes at massage parlors in the\nUnited States during 2002 and 2003. This conduct occurred, according to Applicant,\nbecause he was \u201cbored and lonely.\u201d He went about ten times in 2002, and then began\ndating another woman from the Philippines, Ms. B, who was legally present in the\nUnited States. His relationship with Ms. B will be further discussed under Paragraph 3,\nbelow. He last used a prostitute in 2003, during his background investigation for access\nto a special program by another government agency. Applicant has stated he\nunderstands the use of prostitutes is inappropriate, and he has no interest or desire in\nusing prostitutes in the future. (Transcript at 63-65; Government Exhibit 6 at 7.)\n\n3\nPrimarily because of his sexual behavior, Applicant\u2019s access to special programs\nwas denied by two different government agencies in 2004 and 2005. (Government\nExhibit 6 at 11-15, 32-46.) Of particular interest is the statement of the Chief,\nAdjudications, of another government agency, dated August 24, 2004, affirming the\ndenial of Applicant\u2019s access:\nCases involving a denial of access because of frequenting\nprostitutes is always difficult as no one wants to moralize or be \u201cthe\nmorality police.\u201d However, if [Applicant] had engaged in shoplifting as\nrecently and over the period that he has solicited prostitutes no one would\nchallenge that denial of access was the correct call. Most disturbing is the\nfact that [Applicant] frequented a prostitute after his first polygraph when\nhe was asked to extensively discuss this activity. Clearly he knew this was\nan issue of concern; yet, he availed himself of the service anyway.\n[Applicant] needs to allow time to pass and he needs to conduct himself\nwith self control and within the law during that period. (Government Exhibit\n6 at 39.) (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn addition to the allegations discussed above, subparagraph 1.g. states that\nApplicant used marijuana after being granted a security clearance by the Defense\nDepartment. Applicant admits using marijuana on about 20 occasions with a friend while\nhe was stationed in Saudi Arabia, and also in Amsterdam. This occurred in the time\nperiod 1994-95, has not occurred since then, and Applicant has no desire to use\nmarijuana in the future. Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement indicating that\nhe will not use any controlled substance in the future, and agreeing that any future use\nwill result in automatic revocation of his security clearance. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit Q at 4;\nTranscript at 42-44, 67-69, 71-73.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that is illegal, reflects a lack of\njudgment or discretion, or may subject Applicant to undue influence or coercion.\nSpecifically, the Government alleges that the sexual conduct set forth above under\nParagraph 1 has security significance under this Guideline as well.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline B, Foreign Influence)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has or had foreign contacts or interests that may leave him\nvulnerable to manipulation, pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\nApplicant resided in Saudi Arabia from 1992 through 1999, and on the island of\nGuam from 2005 to the present. From 1999 to 2005 he lived in the United States.\nDuring the time Applicant lived in Saudi Arabia he visited the Philippines and\nThailand on several occasions. He last visited Thailand in 2005. The ability to have\n\nGuam is 544 square kilometers, about three times the size of the District of Columbia, with an estimated 2011\n1\npopulation \nof \n183,286. \n(C entral \nIntellig e nce \nAgency, \nW orld \nFact \nBook, \nG uam ,\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gq.html (last updated February 28, 2011.)\n4\nsocial contacts between men and women in Saudi Arabia are very limited. Where\nApplicant was stationed there were no single American women at all. He did develop a\nrelationship with a Filipino woman, Ms. A, who was also legally working in Saudi Arabia.\nThey dated for several years, and the two of them would travel together on occasion.\nThe relationship has since ended. (Transcript at 36-42,.)\n           In 2002, while living in the United States, Applicant began dating a legal resident\nPhilippine national, Ms. B. This relationship was open, as was his prior relationship with\nMs. A, and continued for several years, ending in 2004. Applicant does not currently\nhave a girlfriend. (Transcript at 47-50.)    \nSince living in Guam Applicant has visited the Philippines several times, the last\ntime being in 2009. These visits are two-fold. First, Guam is a small island  and many\n1\nresidents there vacation in the Philippines, which is cheaper and a shorter flight than to\nthe United States. Applicant is also nearing retirement age and is looking to possibly\nretire to the Philippines. (Transcript at 59-61, 65-66, 70.)\nMitigation\nApplicant honorably served in the United States Air Force, and subsequently in\nthe Air National Guard, from 1982 through 1991. (Applicant Exhibits A, B, C and D.) He\nreceived a letter of appreciation from the Royal Saudi Air Force for his work with them\nwhile stationed in Saudi Arabia. (Applicant Exhibit E.)\nApplicant is a respected and valued worker at his current employment in Guam.\nHis \u201cPerformance and Development Summary\u201d for each year from 2005 through 2009\nshow that he either \u201cmeets\u201d or \u201cexceeds\u201d his company standard. (Applicant Exhibit G, H,\nI, J and  K.)\nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from work associates, including\nhis current supervisor and past supervisors. His current supervisor finds Applicant \u201cto be\na reliable, trustworthy employee. He is consistent in his work ethic.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit\nL.) Applicant\u2019s past supervisors state he is \u201cvery dependable, reliable,\u201d \u201ca valued\nemployee,\u201d and \u201cconscientious.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits M, N and O.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\n\n5\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own\ncommon sense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest in any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nRegarding all the allegations, the following Disqualifying Conditions are arguably\napplicable:\n16.c. credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information; and\n16.d. credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information.\n16.e. personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the\nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in\nanother country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or\nthat is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve\nas a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or\nintelligence service or other group.\nRegarding all the allegations, the following Mitigating Conditions are applicable:\n17.c. the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\n7\n17.d. the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and\n17.e. the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant admits that his conduct with prostitutes, particularly while stationed in\nSaudi Arabia from 1992 through 1998, and briefly in the United States in 2002 and\n2003, was not appropriate. He especially understands the security significance of such\nbehavior, given that two other governmental agencies denied his access based\nprimarily on that conduct. However, it occurred at least eight years ago and there have\nbeen no recurrences. Applicant credibly stated that he has no interest or desire to visit\nprostitutes and shall not engage in such conduct again. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was almost 15 years ago, and occurred when he was\nstationed in Saudi Arabia. He is not addicted to illegal drugs in any way, has no urge to\nuse them, and willingly signed a statement stating he would not use drugs in the future\nwith automatic revocation of his clearance for a positive drug test.\nThese incidents happened a long time ago, have not been repeated, and the\nApplicant has shown that they were situational in nature. He has mitigated the security\nsignificance of this conduct. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior)\nThe security concern for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion,\nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse\ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nThe Government has presented enough evidence to meet their burden of proof,\nwhich is minimal. The following disqualifying conditions are arguably applicable based\non this finding:\n13.a. sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual\nhas been prosecuted;\n\n8\n13.b. a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n13.c. sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation or duress;\n13.d. sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of\ndiscretion or judgment.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, the following mitigating conditions have\napplication. They are:\n14.b. the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n14.c. the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress;\n14.d. the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\nThe discussion concerning the allegations of subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.\napplies to this Guideline as well. While Applicant is certainly not proud of his conduct, it\noccurred at least eight years in the past, and he has no intentions of engaging in such\nconduct in the future. He has mitigated the security concerns under this Guideline as\nwell. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline B, Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant has travelled to Thailand and the Philippines while stationed first in\nSaudi Arabia, then in Guam. He has dated two Filipino women at different times, one\nwhile in Saudi Arabia and the other in the United States. There is only one Disqualifying\nCondition which even arguably applies:\n\n9\n7.b. connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nThe following Mitigating Conditions are applicable, given the factual status of this\ncase:\n8.a. the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n8.b. there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n8.c. contact or communications with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nApplicant\u2019s travels to Thailand were, on the whole, done while he was in Saudi\nArabia. He has not been back there in many years and has no desire to return. His trips\nto the Philippines are consistent with a person who lives on Guam, for whom the\nPhilippines is a short plane ride away. He does not currently have a girlfriend, Filipino or\notherwise, and there is no indication that his past girlfriends attempted to influence him\nin any way. He has overcome any lingering security concerns brought about by his\ntravels and choice in girlfriends. Paragraph 3 is found for Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n10\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I specifically find that the\nApplicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under the whole-person\nconcept, independently of Guidelines E, D and B. \nApplicant did not meet the standard expected of individuals who hold security\nclearances while stationed in a remote duty station abroad, and then for a period here at\nhome. The admitted conduct occurred at least eight years ago, and concerning drugs\nalmost 15 years ago, and has not been repeated. He has acknowledged his wrong-\ndoing and promises not to engage in the conduct again. DOHA proceedings are not\ndesigned to punish any particular applicant for past conduct, but to make a reasoned\ndecision whether, under all the circumstances, he or she can be trusted with the\nnation\u2019s secrets. Applicant has shown many behavioral changes, which show that he is\ntrustworthy. Under the particular facts of this case, I find that there is little to no potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is no\nlikelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alleged\nPersonal Conduct, Sexual Behavior and Foreign Influence. On balance, I conclude that\nApplicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports granting his request for a\nsecurity clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.f.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3.d.:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 9, 2008.  She answered the\nSOR in writing on July 19, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request soon thereafter, and I received the case\nassignment on August 12, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 19, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 19, 2008.  The Government\noffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 8, which were received without objection.

In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n3\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n4\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  During her extended period of unemployment\nor underemployment, the Applicant accumulated her delinquent debt.  These are clearly\ncountered by the Mitigating Conditions found in Subparagraphs 20(b) and 20 (d).  Under\nSubparagraph 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, . .\n.), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Furthermore,\nSubparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Here, the Applicant\nhas addressed all of the alleged past due debt.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Here, she has the unqualified support\nof her manager (AppX E).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his financial considerations.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 17, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J(Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 29, 2009 after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \n\nThe Judge found, inter alia, that Applicant was arrested five times between 1992 and 2007.\nShe found that Applicant pled guilty in four of the incidents to one or more of the charges against\nher.  The Judge concluded that this criminal conduct was not mitigated.  The Judge also found that\nApplicant falsified a 2005 security clearance application by leaving off a 1999 arrest.  The Judge\nconcluded that the falsification was not mitigated.\nThe first section of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief contains her arguments concerning why a case\nagainst her has not been established under Guideline J, or why the Judge\u2019s adverse findings on the\nallegations under Guideline J are otherwise improper.  Applicant\u2019s brief is not a model of clarity, but\na fair reading of same reveals that the arguments Applicant proffers regarding the Guideline J\nallegations are couched in terms of why the government failed to establish that she falsified her\nsecurity clearance application with regard to the underlying criminal conduct.  Any issue regarding\nthe content of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application would be, as far as the SOR in this case is\nconcerned, a matter for consideration under Guideline E, as opposed to Guideline J.  Also, only one\nof the five Guideline J allegations involves underlying criminal conduct that is the subject of the lone\nSOR allegation alleging falsification under Guideline E.  There is no presumption of error below.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments about failure to establish falsifications do nothing to establish error regarding\nthe Judge\u2019s Guideline J findings.   \nApplicant makes reference to matters directly related to Guideline J only when talking about\nallegation 1.e of the SOR, an allegation dealing with possession of a controlled substance.  There,\nApplicant maintains that the Judge failed to fully explain the reasons for her adverse finding.  The\nApplicant also mentions matters she considers mitigating, such as negative results on post-conviction\ndrug tests.  After a review of the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board concludes that the Judge adequately\nexplained her reasons for her adverse finding under SOR allegation 1.e.   The matters that Applicant\ncites in mitigation do not establish that the Judge\u2019s conclusion was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\nIn the remainder of her brief, Applicant states: (a) the government did not prove the\nfalsification allegation under Guideline E against her; (b) additional allegations and information were\npresented that were not addressed in the SOR and should not have been used adversely against\nApplicant; and (c) the Judge improperly used parts of the record to influence her adverse decision\non allegations based on other parts of the record.  Applicant has failed to establish error on the part\nof the Judge.   \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\n\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct under Guideline E and considered the possible application\nof relevant conditions and factors.  However, the Judge concluded that there was insufficient\nevidence to mitigate the Guideline E allegation.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the\nrecord. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge considered matters not specifically alleged\nin the SOR improperly or that the Judge was unduly influenced by negative aspects of the record\nwhen evaluating other parts of the record.  There is a presumption in favor of regularity and good\nfaith on the part of DOHA Judges as they engage in the process of deciding cases.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 99-0019 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 1999).   After considering the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge\u2019s decision made proper use of evidence not directly linked to the SOR\nallegations, and used such evidence appropriately in her whole person analysis.  The Judge\u2019s decision\ncomplies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1 in that the Judge considered the totality of\nApplicant\u2019s conduct in reaching her decision, and she was not improperly swayed by any particular\nportion of the record in reaching her findings and conclusions.  See, ISCR Case No. 05-03948 at 3-4\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2007).  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable. \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett       \nJeffrey D.

On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines J and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 30, 2008. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 5, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nApril 29, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the government\nmust establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took place.\nSecond, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and events\nand a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring and\ndissenting, in part).\nGE 1 (e-QIP); Tr. 16, 18.\n2\nTr. 17-20.\n3\n2\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on November 17, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on March 2, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on March 3, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 9, 2009, and\nI convened the hearing as scheduled on March 31, 2009. The government offered six\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf.  She did not submit any exhibits. The\nrecord closed on March 31, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nApril 10, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on March 17, 2009, less than 15 days\nbefore the hearing. (Tr. 6.) At the hearing, I advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6\nE3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively\nwaived her right to the notice. (Tr. 8.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated November 5, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e and 2.a of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6 2.b. of the SOR.1\nApplicant is 39 years old and married. She works as a technical writer for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor, a job she has held since July 2005. She received a\nclearance in January 2007.2\nApplicant currently attends a local community college and plans to graduate in\nDecember 2009 with an associates degree. She attends church regularly, works for a\nrescue mission and helps at a soup kitchen. In June 1995, a drunk driver killed her\nmother in a car accident. As a result, she does advocacy work for Mothers Against\nDrunk Drivers.3\nIn 1992 when she was 23 years old, Applicant and two friends drove to a local\nshopping area. She waited in her car while her two friends entered the store to shop.\n\nThe police charged Applicant under State Code Art. 27 \u00a7342, which is now State Code, C L \u00a77-104 (revised\n4\n2002). Under the revisions, the theft of an item valued at above $500 is a felony.\nGE 3; GE 5; Tr. 22-23.\n5\nGE 3; GE 5; Tr. 23-25, 40-41.\n6\nTr. 43-45, 67.\n7\n3\nHer two friends shoplifted items from the store, then returned to her car. She drove\naway, but a witness gave the police her vanity license plate letters. The police arrested\nher two days later and charged her with theft plus $300 and conspiracy (SOR \u00b6 1.a).\nShe pled guilty and the court sentenced her to one year on probation and community\nservice. The record does not provide information on whether this was a felony or\nmisdemeanor crime.  Immediately after her arrest, Applicant stopped associating with\n4\none of these friends, but she still has contact with the other friend. She acknowledged\nthat she was \u201changing out\u201d with the wrong people at this time.5\nIn August 1994, Applicant decided to throw a 25  birthday party for herself. She\nth\nasked her older sister if she could use her credit card to purchase items for her\nupcoming birthday party. Her sister agreed, provided Applicant paid the debt back\nquickly. In August and September 1994, Applicant charged $1,200 on her sister\u2019s credit\ncard. She paid $200 of these charges. When she did not pay the remainder of the\ncharges, her sister contacted the credit card company and advised that these charges\nwere the result of unauthorized use of the credit card. The credit card company pursued\ncriminal action. In June 1995, just after her mother had been killed, the police issued an\narrest warrant for Applicant. She turned herself in to the police on June 21, 1995. After\nthe police booked her on three criminal charges of theft, she appeared before a court\ncommissioner and posted her bond. She was released from the police station sometime\nafter midnight. She does not recall spending the night in jail.6\nIn March 1996, Applicant pled guilty to theft in excess of $300, a felony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b and 1.c) The court sentenced her to eight years in jail then suspended the sentence.\nThe court placed her on three years of probation, fined her and directed her to pay\nrestitution, which she did. Applicant complied with the terms of her probation, but\nsometimes failed to pay the $25 fee the probation office required her to pay each time\nshe met with her probation officer.7\nIn the fall 1999, Applicant\u2019s stepmother provided her with a check to purchase\npaint and paint supplies for some painting Applicant intended to do for her father and\nstepmother. Applicant\u2019s stepmother authorized Applicant to write the check for no more\nthan $200. Applicant purchased the paint and supplies, but wrote the check for $300.\nApplicant retained $100 for herself, as she believed this was the amount her stepmother\nintended to pay her for the work. Applicant assumed wrongly. Her stepmother called her\nfor three days, seeking immediate repayment of the $100. When Applicant did not\nrespond to the calls or immediately repay the money, her stepmother called the police.\nThe police charged Applicant with two counts of theft: less $300 value; two counts of\n\nGE 3; GE 5; Tr. 26-27, 52, 55-58, 69.\n8\nGE 3; Tr. 53-55. At the hearing, Department Counsel referenced another possible arrest for violation of her\n9\nprobation following the 1992 arrest and sentencing, but the record contains no documentation regarding this\narrest. Since it is not listed in the SOR, no adverse inference will be made against Applicant based on this\nissue.\nGE 2; Tr. 27-32, 59-62.\n10\nId.\n11\n4\nforgery-private documents, and two counts of uttering a false document. Applicant pled\nguilty to two charges of theft, a misdemeanor offense, and the court Nolle Prosequi the\nremaining charges. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) The court sentenced the Applicant to 90 days in jail,\nwhich was suspended, placed her on 18 months probation, and fined her $55. She paid\nher stepmother the $100 long before the court hearing.8\nIn December 2003, the court issued a bench warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest for\nviolation of probation related to her 1996 conviction. This arrest related to her failure to\npay all the fees required by the Office of Probation and Parole. She appeared at a\nhearing in January 2004 and paid these monies. The court concluded the proceedings\nand did not make any findings against Applicant. This arrest is not listed in the SOR.9\nIn February 2007, Applicant left her work site with a computer. She drove in her\nusual car to a local military base with the intent to take the computer on the base for\nrepairs. She stopped at the entrance gate for a security inspection. When the military\npersonnel opened the truck of her car, they found a purse with items in a different name\nthan hers (purse belonged to her aunt), and a white powder, which was crushed ice\nmelt. Based on finding these items in her trunk and a concern the white powder was an\nillegal drug, the military personnel conducted a full search of her car. They found a\nplastic bag with a brown leafy substance which was identified as marijuana. Applicant\ndenies any knowledge of the marijuana. The record lacks evidence that she uses\nmarijuana, but she admitted at the hearing that family members do smoke marijuana\nand that these family members ride in her car.10\nThe military police arrested Applicant and charged her with possession of a\ncontrolled substance with intent to use. She immediately reported her arrest to her\nsupervisor and security officer. Applicant pled guilty to possession of drug\nparaphernalia, a misdemeanor offense under state law, on the recommendation of her\nattorney, and to put the matter behind her. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) The court placed her on\nprobation for six months, fined her $250, including costs, and ordered 20 hours of\ncommunity service. Applicant complied with the terms of her sentence. She\nacknowledged that she knew her guilty plea could adversely impact her security\nclearance.11\nApplicant completed her e-QIP on November 4, 2005. She listed her felony arrest\nin 1995, but did not list her misdemeanor theft arrest in 1999 and her probation violation\n\nGE 1; Tr. 33, 50,\n12\n5\narrest in 2003. At the hearing, she stated she did not know why she did not list these\narrests. She thinks she may have thought she needed only to list her felony arrest or\nthat she misunderstood the question. She denies deliberately falsifying her answers\nregarding her past criminal conduct.   \n12\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n6\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 31, the following conditions could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nAlthough she was not arrested in 1994, Applicant has been arrested five times\nbetween 1992 and 2007. With the exception of her 2003 arrest for violation of probation,\nApplicant has pled guilty in each case to one or more of the charges against her. These\ndisqualifying conditions raise a security concern in this case.\nUnder AG \u00b6 32, the Applicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns\nthrough the following conditions:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\n\n7\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nThe last arrest for theft occurred nearly 10 years ago, and was the result of a\nfamily issue. Applicant does not deny the conduct which led to her arrests for theft on\nthree separate occasions. Both her arrest in 1995 and 1999 occurred because she\neither failed to honor her obligations with a family member or took advantage of a\nsituation with a family member. Since her 1999 arrest, she has improved her\nrelationship with her immediate family members. She has not associated with one of the\nfriends who shoplifted in 1992. She remains friends with the other individual, but has not\nbeen involved in any criminal activity with this individual. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) have\npartial application with respect to SOR allegations 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. SOR allegation 1.b\nis found in favor of Applicant because the criminal charge referenced is part of the\ncriminal case contained in SOR allegation 1.c.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nUnder AG \u00b6 16, the following conditions could raise a security concern in this\ncase and may be disqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and\n\nAlthough she did not list her 2003 arrest, this issue is not raised in the SOR.\n13\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n14\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted a material fact from her SF-86 when she\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the question about other arrests not previously listed which occurred\nwithin seven years of completing her e-QIP in November 2005. Applicant did not list her\narrest in 1999.  This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\n13\ntrustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to her honesty. In her response and at\nthe hearing, she denies, however, that she had an intent to hide information about her\nthese arrests. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving the omission was deliberate. Proof of an omission, standing alone,\ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission\noccurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s\nintent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the\n14\ngovernment must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in her\nanswer was deliberate.\nApplicant denied intentionally leaving out information about her arrests in 1999 as\nshe knew she needed to be truthful. Even though she had knowledge of these arrests,\nApplicant\u2019s failure to answer \u201cyes\u201d in light of this knowledge is not proof that she\nintentionally falsified her e-QIP. Applicant, however, could not explain why she failed to\nlist these arrests. She guessed that maybe because she misunderstood the question,\neven though she writes for a living, or did not believe she needed to list arrests for\nmisdemeanor offenses. I find her lack of a credible explanation indicative of her intent to\nkeep this information from the government. The government has established that\nApplicant intended to hide these arrests in an effort to minimize her past criminal\nconduct. Given her involvement with the criminal justice system over a period of 15\nyears, the government has established a pattern of rules violations which resulted in\ncriminal arrests and convictions. The disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and\n16(d)(3) apply.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Of the listed\nconditions, the following may be applicable in this case:\n\n9\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant acknowledged her additional arrests in response to the SOR and\ndiscussed the omitted arrests at the hearing. She immediately contacted her supervisor\nand security officer when she was arrested in 2007, which shows her understanding\nthat she must report negative information. Although she has acknowledged her arrests,\nher recent arrest for possession of marijuana indicates she has not yet taken all the\nsteps necessary to ensure that she will not again be involved with the criminal justice\nsystem. Her failure to be candid on her e-QIP cannot be mitigated because a recent\nfalsification of a security clearance application is too recent and serious to be mitigated\nat this time. Falsification of security documents is a fundamental breach that cuts to the\nheart of reliability and trustworthiness. She has not mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guideline E. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \n\n10\nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is\nattending college with hopes that she will graduate in December 2009 with an Associate\nof Arts degree. She plans to continue her college education. She performs volunteer\nwork for several agencies and regularly attends church. These activities are very\npositive in her life. Her continued friendship with one individual involved in her 1992\narrest is not of concern as she and this friend have not been involved in subsequent\ncriminal activity. She has repaired her relationship her family in more recent years. She,\nhowever, continues to show poor judgment when she allows family members, whom\nshe knows to use marijuana, in her car. Her family ties are the reason for many of her\nproblems in the past and possibly more recently. She has made decisions which reflect\npoor judgment not only in the past, but over a substantial period of time. She decided to\nplead guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia, knowing it could impact her security\nclearance eligibility. By pleading guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia, she\nacknowledges she violated the law while holding a security clearance. While she is\ntrying to improve her life, she has not demonstrated that she has taken all the\nnecessary steps to show that the government should not have any concerns about\ngranting her a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her personal conduct and\ncriminal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 17, 2009\nDecision\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn July 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuidelines E and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 11, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nNovember 5, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 3, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 15, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on her\nown behalf and submitted no documents at the hearing. At the request of Applicant, the\nrecord remained open until December 22, 2008, to allow Applicant to offer post hearing\ndocuments. She offered into evidence three character letters, and a Performance\n\n2\nEvaluation, which have been marked as Exhibits A through D respectively, and entered\ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nDecember 23, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 24 years old, and a high school graduate with one year of college.\nShe is unmarried, and she has no children. \nApplicant works for a defense contractor as a survey specialist, and she seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n1.a. On November 16, 2005, Applicant was taken into custody in California, after\ncrossing the border from Mexico into the United States with an illegal alien hiding in the\ntrunk of the car, in which she was riding as a passenger. The initial charges against her\nwere (1) Bringing illegal aliens into the United States, and (2) Alien smuggling. She was\ndetained in jail overnight, and on the following day she signed an agreement with the\nUnited States that if she participated in this illegal activity again, she would be arrested\nand prosecuted. She was released, and no charges were brought against her. \nApplicant testified that at the time of this event she was 21 years of age. On the\nday of the incident Applicant received a telephone call from her cousin, asking Applicant\nif she would like to accompany her cousin on a ride to Tijuana to pick up a relative of\nher cousin\u2019s boyfriend from the Tijuana airport, and bring him back to the United States.\nApplicant stated that she had done this with her cousin on two previous occasions.  She\nagreed to accompany her on this date.  \nShe testified that they picked up the individual from the Tijuana airport, and as\nthey were preparing to reenter the United States, her cousin stopped the vehicle,\nopened the trunk of her vehicle, and the individual whom they had picked up got into the\ntrunk. Applicant then asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d It was then that she was first\ninformed that he did not have the proper paperwork to enter the United States legally.\nApplicant testified that she had no prior suspicion of what they would be doing, since the\nprevious two times they had transferred someone from the Tijuana airport into the U.S.,\nthe person had the proper paperwork and simply sat in the vehicle and entered legally. \nApplicant testified that when she realized what they were doing on this trip, she\nknew that it was wrong, and she protested this action to her cousin. However, since she\nwas in unfamiliar territory in Tijuana, Mexico, and it was the middle of the night, she was\n\n3\nafraid for her safety, and she simply did not know what to do. As they attempted to\ncross into the United States the Border Patrol stopped the vehicle and found the\nindividual hiding in the trunk. Both she and her cousin were searched and handcuffed,\nand ultimately they were fingerprinted and their pictures were taken. \nThey were both detained overnight in jail, and in the morning Applicant signed a\ndocument, stating that if she was involved in this conduct in the future she would be\narrested and charged with committing a felony. Thereafter, both she and her cousin\nwere released and they had no further requirements.\nApplicant testified credibly as to her remorse over being involved in this incident,\nand that she would never engage in such conduct in the future.   She also reiterated\nthat with the exception of this event, she has never been arrested or involved in any\nother illegal conduct. Finally, she testified that if she ever found herself in a similar\ncircumstance she would exit the vehicle and call to have someone else come and take\nher home. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has engaged in criminal conduct. \n2.a. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 1, constitutes criminal\nconduct. At the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice\nof 8 United States Code section 1324. I find that Applicant\u2019s action did constitute a\nviolation of that code section, as she attempted to bring an alien into the United States\nin a manner other than through a designated port of entry or place other than as\ndesignated by the Commissioner. \nMitigation\nApplicant offered into evidence three character letters from individuals who have\nknown her in her professional capacity (Exhibits A through C). They all were extremely\nlaudatory and described Applicant as \u201c honest and reliable,\u201d and \u201cone of our brightest,\nhardest working, and trusted employee\u2019s (sic)!\u201d\nFinally, Applicant also submitted her Performance Evaluation, dated August 24,\n2007. In all categories she was rated Good, with an Outstanding rating as to treating her\nsupervisors with respect, and cooperation with others. She was rated overall as a \u201cgood\nemployee and a valued member of the team\u201d, with her \u201cskills growing on a daily basis.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s conduct\nexhibited questionable judgement, and a potential unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations. However, I do not find that Applicant\u2019s conduct falls under any of the\n\n5\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC). While she did engage in criminal conduct as will be\ndiscussed below, the circumstances involved in her conduct were rather unique. First\nshe did not have any advanced notice of the conduct and only learned that her cousin\nwas planning to transport an illegal alien into the U.S., when they were in Tijuana,\nMexico, late at night. While she should have refused to remain in the vehicle when she\nrealized what her cousin intended to do, it is understandable that a young girl in these\ncircumstances would be frightened and not sure what the would be the proper action\nshe should take.\n I resolve Paragraph 1, Personal Conduct, for Applicant.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government also established that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct, by\nbeing involved in the illegal transportation of an alien into the United States, which is a\nviolation of  8 United States Code section 1324. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions, I find that DC 31. (a), a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. DC 31. (c), allegations or\nadmissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nis also applicable to this case. \nHowever, I find that MC (a) is applicable, as this conduct happened under\nunusual circumstances as reviewed above, it is highly unlikely to recur again, and it\ndoes not cast doubt on the Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness and good\njudgement. MC (d) also applies as I find successful rehabilitation, since no criminal\nconduct has occurred in more than three years, Applicant expressed sincere remorse,\nand the positive character letters and Performance Evaluation, is strong evidence of a\ngood employment record. \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct, is found for Applicant\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n6\nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines E and J, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, as to why the mitigating Adjudicative\nGuidelines apply, the youth of the Applicant at the time of the incident, the facts\nsurrounding the incident, her genuine contrition, and her positive recommendations and\nPerformance Evaluation, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no significant\nquestions or  doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude that at this time,\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 10, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on January 24, 2006.  On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines H and E for Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 28, 2008.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 17, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on November 21, 2008, and it was\nassigned to another Administrative Judge on December 16, 2008.  I received the case\nassignment on January 20, 2009.  DOHA had issued a notice of hearing on January 5,\n\n2\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 21, 2009.  The Government\noffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 and 2, which were received without objection.  Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through D, without\nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on February 2, 2009.  I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 4, 2009, to submit\nadditional matters.  On February 3, 2009, he submitted Exhibit E, without objection. The\nrecord closed on February 4, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations of the\nSOR, with explanations.  He also provided additional information to support his request\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement & Guideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Applicant is a 54 year Electrical Engineer, married with two grown children\n(TR at page 15 line 23 to page 18 line 16).  He has worked in the defense industry for\nabout 28 years, and has held a security clearance for that period of time (TR at page 19\nline 20 to page 20 line 10).\n1.a.~1.c. and 2.a.  From January of 2001 until about January/February of 2006,\nthe Applicant used marijuana \u201c[a]bout 15 times\u201d (TR at page 22 line 1 to page 25 line\n16).  His last usage was during the Super Bowl in 2006 (TR at page 58 line 20 to page\n60 line 2).  His usage was always in a social setting, where the marijuana was passed\nto the Applicant, and he would smoke the illegal substance (TR at page 22 line 1 to\npage 25 line 16).  He smoked this marijuana while holding a security clearance, and his\nlast usage was after he submitted his e-QIP in January of 2006 (TR at page 25 line 22\nto page 29 line 10).  The Applicant has disavowed any future drug abuse, and has\nsigned a written statement of intent to that end (TR at page 32 line 4 to page 34 line 14,\nand AppX E at page 3).\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n2.b.  The Applicant failed to file his Federal and State income tax returns for tax\nyears 2002 and 2003, in a timely fashion (TR at page 35 line 5 to page 37 line 8).  The\nApplicant asked his spouse to file their tax returns, but she refused to do it (Id).  This\nwas a \u201cbattle of stubborness,\u201d which is corroborated by a statement from Applicant\u2019s\nwife (TR at page 35 line 5 to page 37 line 8, and AppX E at page 2).  They subsequently\npaid their taxes, along with the penalties and interest their tardiness incurred (Id).\n2.c.  In 2001, the Applicant went to a foreign country for 5~6 days to meet\npotential investors for a private business proposition (TR at page 42 line 20 to page 52\nline 18).  This trip was during Christmas break on short notice, and he verbally informed\nhis employer\u2019s security office of his intended trip (TR at page 42 line 20 to page 52 line\n\n3\n18, and at page 55 line 14 to page 56 line 3).  Prior to his trip, he did not know what\npotential investors he would meet, but one of them turned out to be a retired General of\nthe foreign country (Id).  The Applicant did not discuss any sensitive information with\nthis General or with any other potential investor (TR at page 42 line 20 to page 52 line\n18, and at page 55 line 14 to page 56 line 3).  [The trip attracted no meaningful foreign\ninvestment.]  He reported his foreign national meetings \u201ctwo or three months\u201d after his\nreturn from the trip (Id).  No disciplinary action was taken vis-a-vis the Applicant as a\nresult of this trip.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\n\n4\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nParagraph 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe guideline also notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.\nUnder Subparagraph 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying.  In addition, \u201cany\nillegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d under Subparagraph 25(g).\nHere the Applicant used marijuana about 15 times, after being granted a security\nclearance, with his last usage being in January/February of 2006.  This is countered,\nhowever, by the mitigating condition found in Subparagraph 26(a).  The Applicant\u2019s\nDrug Involvement \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Here, the Applicant last used\nmarijuana about three years ago.  Subparagraph 26(b) is also applicable, as Applicant\nhas shown \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (4) a\nsigned statement of intent\u201d to disassociate from those who use illegal substances, and\n\u201cnot [to] knowingly partake in any illegal substance while holding any security\nclearance.\u201d\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas\nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment . . . .\u201d  Here, the Applicant used an illegal substance, marijuana,\nabout 15 times, used it once after executing his e-QIP, and failed to file 2002 and 2003\ntax returns in a timely fashion.  He should have also reported his 2001 foreign contacts\nin a more timely fashion.  However, this is countered by Subparagraph 17(c) as \u201cso\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Again, the Applicant\u2019s last\nmarijuana usage was about three years ago; and his other faux pas, the untimely tax\nfilings and tardy foreign contact report, occurred 4~8 years ago.  Furthermore, the\nApplicant has formally and credibly eschewed any future drug involvement.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  The Applicant has the unqualified support\nof his Senior Program Manager and of his Section Manager (AppX A).  Overall, the\nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns arising from his Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant had some delinquent debts incurred more than three years ago that\nshe could not afford to repay. All these debts were finally discharged in bankruptcy in\nJanuary 2009. She is now solvent, financially responsible, and debt-free. Based upon a\nthorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access\nto classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on October 5, 2007. On August 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nApril 16, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 30, 2008. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on the same date, and originally requested a decision\nwithout a hearing before an administrative judge. After preliminary discussions with\nDepartment Counsel, she changed her mind and requested a hearing. Department\nCounsel then requested a hearing pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7, to accommodate this\nrequest. (Tr. at 17-20.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 19,\n2008, and DOHA assigned the case to me on November 21, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 2, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on January 9, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were also admitted\nwithout objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s and Department Counsel\u2019s joint request to leave\nthe record open to permit Applicant to obtain and submit additional documents\nconcerning her bankruptcy. This evidence was submitted and admitted as AE C, without\nobjection by Department Counsel, on February 12, 2009. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where she has\nworked for two years as an administrative assistant. She is a single mother of two\nteenage children. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted to all of the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, describing 5 delinquent credit card debts totaling $25,954.\nThose admissions are incorporated in the following findings. \nApplicant and the father of her children ended their long-term relationship around\n2002.

Her family members did not\nhave excess funds to help her either. Finally, an attorney advised her to file for Chapter\n7 bankruptcy protection and start over. She found this to be her only realistic option, and\nfiled the bankruptcy papers on October 23, 2008. She listed all of the SOR-listed debts\nand a $1,629 debt to a computer company as unsecured, non-priority dischargeable\ndebts. She also completed the required credit counseling and debtor education course\non personal financial management. On January 26, 2009, the bankruptcy court issued a\nfinal order discharging her debts.

She does not own a car, and rides to work with her\nmother. She earns $1,200 every two weeks, and has started a regular savings program\nnow that she no longer owes payments on any outstanding debts and has monthly\nsurplus income. She receives minimal, if any, regular child support assistance from her\nchildren\u2019s father, but her brother helps with tuition payments for her daughter. She\ntestified credibly and convincingly that she never intends to incur delinquent debt again,\nand will continue the responsible budgeting and spending pattern she has followed over\nthe past two years. She also highly values her present employment opportunity, is very\nsensitive to security issues and requirements, and knows well that future irresponsibility\nwill not be tolerated. (Tr. at 36-41, 46-47.)\n \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n\n4\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government evidence raised three of\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d\n\u201c(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any\nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d There was neither any\nallegation nor proof of compulsive, addictive, or problem gambling. Nor was there any\nevidence of drug abuse, alcoholism, tax evasion, or illegal financial practices. Simply,\nApplicant went through a period of three or four years during which she carelessly ran\nup credit card debt without regard for the long-term implications. She was willing to\nsatisfy those debts, but unable to do so because of a period of unemployment after\nwhich her income was insufficient to afford substantial debt payments while avoiding\nnew debts. She finally realized that bankruptcy was her only practical option. She\navailed herself of that lawful manner to resolve her delinquent indebtedness, and\nincurred no new debts since returning to work in April 2007. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 19(a) no\nlonger applies to Applicant, leaving only potential concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) or (c).\nShe is no longer at any risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds, since\nher income more than meets her regular living expenses, and all of her former debt has\n\n5\nbeen lawfully discharged. Only if her history of not meeting financial obligations incurred\nthrough frivolous spending indicates current poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations should those admitted facts support\npresent security concerns.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from a\nhistory of unpaid debt or frivolous spending. Since Applicant did not dispute the\nlegitimacy of any SOR-listed debt, the four potentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s formerly delinquent debts all arose more than two years ago, as a\nresult of a period in her life when she responded to emotional distress by spending\nmore than she earned on herself and remaining loved ones. She left a bad work\nsituation and found much more satisfying work two years ago. About that time she also\nrealized she needed to stop spending irresponsibly and did so. She has taken all\npossible measures to minimize her regular living expenses and maintained gainful\nemployment to remain self-supporting. Her initial efforts to pay off the debts were\nunworkable. Accordingly, she sought and received resolution of all her outstanding debt\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, discharged in January 2009. These actions\nby Applicant establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a), since the debts arose long ago and\nunder circumstances she realized were wrongful and voluntarily stopped. She has\nmaintained financially responsible conduct and incurred no new debts for two years,\nreflecting her good judgment and trustworthiness. Her improved work situation,\nemotional acceptance of single motherhood, and appreciation for the requirement to\nmaintain responsible behavior going forward all support the conclusion that her period\nof frivolous spending is unlikely to recur.\nApplicant freely admitted that her period of excessive spending, while triggered\nby separation from her former long-term partner, was her own fault and \u201cstupid.\u201d\nAccordingly, she did not assert mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). After finding debt\n\n6\nconsolidation plans impractical, Applicant sought the counsel of an attorney and\nfollowed his advice that filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief was her best option. Her\ndebts were successfully and fully resolved through bankruptcy effective January 2009.\nThis establishes substantial additional mitigation and resolves remaining security\nconcern under AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves formerly delinquent debts for which she accepted responsibility, but\ncould not afford to repay while avoiding new debt and supporting two teenage children\nas a single mother. She realized that the frivolous spending that caused these debts\ncould not continue, and stopped such conduct. She sought and followed the advice of\nan attorney to resolve her situation lawfully through bankruptcy. She has incurred no\nnew debt for several years, and is living in a frugal and solvent manner on her current\nincome. There is little likelihood of recurrence of this problem, based on her past\nresponses to such troubles and her current desire to avoid any repeat of them. Her\nbankruptcy discharge has completely alleviated any potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation or duress from her former debt situation, and her enthusiastic desire to\nmaintain eligibility for her present job provides very strong motivation for continued\nresponsibility. The likelihood of recurrence of her relatively brief period of financial\nirresponsibility is very low under her changed and improved life circumstances, and\nrecently demonstrated maturity. \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness security concerns arising from her former failure to satisfy\nfrivolously incurred debts, and history of not meeting financial obligations. Overall, the\n\n7\nrecord evidence leaves no doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns\narising from her financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn May 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on July 30, 2008. A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity \nto file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security \nSeptember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nconcerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 6, 2008. He responded with a letter \ndated August 20, 2008. Department Counsel did not object to his response. I have \nmarked Applicant\u2019s response as Exhibit (Ex.) A, and it is admitted. I received the case \nassignment on September 10, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a college \ngraduate with a Bachelor of Science degree. He was a student ambassador, the highest \nnon-academic honor awarded at his university. He received the university\u2019s leadership \naward on three occasions. He is single with no children.1  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in March 2002, when he was 19 years old, and charged \nwith minor in possession of an alcoholic beverage. He pled guilty and was sentenced to \npay fines and costs of about $250, and to attend a class on alcohol use. He satisfied all \nthe requirements of his sentence.2  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in July 2006, for driving under the influence (DUI). He \ndrank about six beers and three shots of alcohol before he drove the car. He was \nstopped at a DUI checkpoint. The police officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol. He had \nred glassy eyes, slurred speech, and appeared drunk. He did not perform well on the \nfield sobriety test. He refused the breathalyzer test. Applicant pled guilty to reckless \ndriving. He was sentenced to pay fines and costs of about $300, and his license was \nrevoked for three months.3  \n \n \nApplicant again drove after drinking beer on an evening in February 2007. He \nadmitted to drinking about seven beers. He was stopped at about 1:30 in the morning \nfor not stopping at a stop sign. He was arrested and charged with DUI. His prosecution \nwas deferred for one year until August 20, 2008, at which time with good behavior, the \ncharge would be dismissed. He was required to pay court costs, attend a victim impact \npanel, and his license was suspended for three months. There was no evidence to \nsuggest that Applicant did not comply with the terms of his deferred prosecution.4 \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol in about 1999, when he was 16 years old. He \nbelieves he is intoxicated after about four to five drinks. He estimated in January 2008, \nthat he drank to intoxication about six times a year. He recently reported that he no \nlonger drinks to the point of intoxication. He does not believe he has a drinking problem \nand has not received any alcohol counseling or treatment. He credits the rehabilitative \n                                                          \n1 Items 1, 4. \n \n2 Items 1, 4, 5. \n \n3 Items 1, 4-6. \n \n4 Items 1, 4, 5, 7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ninfluence of his church and faith in assisting him in abstaining from his problem \nbehavior.5 \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \n                                                          \n5 Items 4, 5; Ex. A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 22(a). There is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that his drinking habits constituted \u201chabitual or binge\u201d \ndrinking. AG \u00b6 22(c) is not applicable.  \n \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2002, for minor in possession of an alcoholic beverage. \nHe had a DUI in July 2006, that was reduced upon a plea to a reckless driving charge. \nHe had another DUI in February 2007. He has not received alcohol counseling or \ntreatment, but credits the rehabilitative influence of his church and faith. He indicated \nthat he no longer drinks to intoxication. That is positive information. However, Applicant \ndoes not have a sufficient track record without an alcohol-related incident to reap the full \nbenefit of any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant received numerous honors \nin college. He has three alcohol-related arrests, including a DUI arrest in July 2006, and \nanother one seven months later in February 2007. Applicant has not gone long enough \nwithout an alcohol-related incident for a determination that he has eliminated alcohol as \na problem.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Alcohol Consumption security concerns.  \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.
