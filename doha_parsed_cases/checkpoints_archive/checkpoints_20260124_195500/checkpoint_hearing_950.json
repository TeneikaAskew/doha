Connelley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/21/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case, 1  I deny Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. \nOn 14 December 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. 2  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a decision \nwithout hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in \nthis case closed 20 April 2019, when Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM was due. \nApplicant provided no additional evidence. DOHA assigned the case to me 7 May 2019. \n1Consisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-5. \n2DoD conducts trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed in Information Systems \nPositions pursuant to DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on 8 June \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except for SOR 1.g-1.h. He is a \n49-year-old critical facilities engineer sponsored for a public trust position by a defense \ncontractor, for whom he has worked since July 2016. He has not previously had a \ntrustworthiness determination. He was briefly unemployed May-July 2016, but had been \ncontinuously employed as a maintenance engineer from May 2004 to May 2016. \nApplicant married in May 1991, separated in August 2016, and divorced in September \n2017 (Item 2, 3). He and his ex-wife have two adult children. \nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (Items 2-5) establish, 14 delinquent \ndebts totaling over $28,000 (SOR 1.b-1.o); the SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to \ntimely file his 2014-2016 state income tax returns (SOR 1.a). Applicant admits over \n$24,000 in delinquent debt, as well as admitting failing to timely file his 2014-2016 state \nincome tax returns. He claims to have settled SOR debt 1.g in October 2018 (Answer; \nItem 3). However, Applicant\u2019s evidence shows that he settled a delinquent debt that was \nnot alleged in the SOR. 3 Applicant also claimed to have paid the automobile loan at \nSOR 1.h. While the automobile title Applicant submitted with his Answer does not \ncorroborate that claim, Applicant\u2019s October 2018 credit report shows the account paid \nas of July 2017.4 \nThe remaining debts comprise three state tax liens, totaling over $12,000, filed in \nJanuary and July 2013; three unpaid medical bills totaling over $800; a nearly $7,000 \nautomobile repossession; a 2013 judgment for $2,500, and five collection accounts \ntotaling over $2,600. The automobile repossession is a joint account with his ex-wife. \nThe medical debts and collection accounts are reported as Applicant\u2019s individual liability. \nAll but a couple of the delinquent debts predate Applicant\u2019s separation from his wife. \nApplicant disclosed his failure to timely file his 2014-2015 state income tax \nreturns, as well as his failure to file his 2014-2015 Federal income tax returns (not \nalleged), on his March 2017 clearance application (Item 2). He discussed his tax issues, \nincluding his failure to timely file his 2016 state and Federal tax returns, during a \nJanuary 2018 interview with a Government investigator (Item 3). He was also \nconfronted with his SOR debts, based on his April 2017 credit report (Item 4). He \nclaimed to not be aware of some of the debts, but stated that he would investigate all \nthe debts discussed and take action to address them. \n3Applicant\u2019s April 2017 credit report (Item 4) shows a delinquent mattress retailer store credit card, with its \nsponsoring bank, and a full 16-digit account number. This account was reported in collection, but also closed, \nwith a zero balance, and was not alleged in the SOR. The 2 October 2018 settlement letter provided by \nApplicant is from a collection agent for a different sponsoring bank, but with an account number that exactly \nmatches the original creditor. \n4Applicant\u2019s April 2017 credit report (Item 4) showed the account 60-days past due for $237 on a $2,948 \nbalance. His October 2018 credit report (Item 5) shows the same creditor, with an account number matching \nthe first 12 digits of the original debt, as current, with no stated balance as of July 2017. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems, particularly his failures to timely file his \nstate income tax returns, to his contentious separation and divorce. His Answer \ndocumented that he had finally filed his 2015 and 2016 state income tax returns\u2014after \nhe received the SOR\u2014but he had still not filed his 2014 return. He ostensibly has a \nrefund coming for one tax year, and owes twice the amount of the putative refund for \nthe other tax year, but his tax situation for 2014 remains unclear. Even assuming the \nstate seizes the refund and applies it to the balance owed, Applicant did not document \nany payment toward the balance. Moreover, except as noted above, he provided no \nevidence of any efforts to resolve delinquent debts since his divorce. \nApplicant provided no budget or personal financial statement indicating his \nfinancial situation. He has not documented any credit or financial counseling. He \nprovided no work or character references, or evidence of civic or community \ninvolvement. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for \naccess to sensitive information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is \nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case \ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or \ndenial of eligibility for a public trust position. Considering the SOR allegations and the \nevidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). \nTrustworthiness decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s public trust position. The \nGovernment must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. If it does, the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a public trust position, the applicant \nbears a heavy burden of persuasion. \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5 \n5 See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts predate \nhis separation and divorce. With the exception of the automobile account that he paid, \nApplicant has documented no efforts to address his delinquent SOR debts. Moreover, \nthe alleged contentiousness of his separation and divorce does not explain his failure to \ncommunicate with his state tax authority to find an alternative means of addressing his \nunfiled state income tax returns. He did not file his 2015 and 2016 returns until after he \nreceived the SOR, and he still has not filed his 2014 return.6 \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access \nto classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously \nnoted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their \nlegal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to \nhave demonstrated the high degree of judgment and \nreliability required for access to classified information.\u201d7 \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful8 or attributed to the press of other \ncircumstances. 9 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant\u2019s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A \nperson who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \n6\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a history \nof not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulentlyfiling annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n7ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \nSee also, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). \n8 See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester). \n9 See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information).

Indeed, as the \nJudge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 19(g) explicitly \nprovides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that \ncan raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive \npresumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct \nunder any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nclearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 9, 2015). \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an \nApplicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case \nhis failure to timely file his Federal returns for at least eight years has created significant \ntax debt that he has not addressed. \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. \ngiven that he has provided no details about his delinquent debts or his divorce.10 Given \nthat most of his debts arose before his separation, he has not demonstrated that they \narose due to circumstances beyond his control, and he has not documented that he \ntook responsible action to address his financial problems.11 His state tax returns remain \na work in progress, with no clear resolution established.12 Applicant has had no credit or \nfinancial counseling; he has documented no efforts to resolve his debts.13 Moreover, he \nhas obviously not engaged in a good-faith effort to address his debts. 14 Finally, he \nprovided no work or character evidence which might support a whole-person \nassessment to overcome the trustworthiness concerns raised by his conduct. \nAccordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \n10\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n11\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n12\u00b620(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount \nowed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \n13\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . . and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n14\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n5 \n\n          \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1.

He chose to \nignore those notices and accumulated a Federal tax debt of $250,418. He was also put \non notice that he had several delinquent accounts when he had his background interview \nin 2017, and after the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued in late 2018. Applicant \nfailed to act responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts, or to establish a payment \nagreement with the IRS. His debt, including extensive past-due Federal income tax debt, \nremains ongoing and unresolved. Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns \nare not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.       \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 17, 2016, Applicant signed a security clearance application (SCA). On \nDecember 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nOn December 31, 2018, Applicant responded and requested a hearing. On June \n5, 2019, the case was assigned to me, and on June 6, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June \n26, 2019. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.   \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven Government Exhibits (GE \n1-7) and Applicant offered the two exhibits that were attached with his SOR response, \nwhich I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. Applicant objected to GE 4-6, as noted \nbelow. I admitted into evidence all proffered exhibits. I held the record open until July 26, \n2019, in the event either party wanted to submit additional documentation. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2019. On July 26, 2019, Applicant \nsubmitted an e-mail, which I labeled as AE C and admitted without objection, and the \nrecord was closed.   \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters  \n \nApplicant objected to GE 4-6, which are Notices of Federal Tax Liens that were \nfiled against Applicant. Applicant stated his evidence showed that the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) classified these tax liens as \u201cclosed and non-collectible.\u201d Department \nCounsel stated that while Applicant\u2019s evidence may, or may not, mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence, the Notices of Federal Tax Liens were authentic and admissible. \nI reviewed AE A, a letter dated May 27, 2011, which showed that although the IRS \ntemporarily closed Applicant\u2019s case due to it not being currently collectible, the letter also \nspecified that Applicant still owed the outstanding taxes to the IRS, and penalties and \ninterest would continue to accrue. Since this information is relevant and material to the \nissues in this case, I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection, and admitted GE 4-6 into evidence. \n(Tr. 11-12, 16-17) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.n. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.   \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old systems engineer who has been employed by the same \ndefense contractor since 2011. His annual salary is approximately $100,000. He has \ntaken side jobs over the past four years and earned an additional $10,000 - $15,000 per \nyear. He served in the Air Force from 1974 to 1980, and he received an honorable \ndischarge at the rank of E-4. He attended college from 1981 to 1985 and earned two \nassociates degrees. In 1994, he married and has two adult stepchildren from his wife\u2019s \nformer marriage, and they have a daughter, age 24, and a son, age 20.

These allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s evidence. Applicant\u2019s tax issues began in \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nthe late 1990s after he researched and adopted tax-protestor theories. He believed the \nFederal income tax system was invalid and non-obligatory. He did not pay income taxes, \nand he stopped filing his income tax returns for several years. At the hearing, Applicant \nwas vague with details due to the passage of time. He admitted there were years he filed \nincome tax returns in which he intentionally omitted or underreported his income for that \ntax period. He filed some of his Federal income tax returns in about 2007, but he could \nnot recall the specific tax years he filed. (Tr. 29-34; GE 4-6) \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax beliefs changed in approximately 2007 after a prominent tax \nprotestor he followed was incarcerated.

He admitted he had received numerous IRS tax notices over \nthe years informing him of his legal requirement to file and pay Federal taxes. (Tr. 34-36) \n \nApplicant retained a tax preparation service, and according to their calculations, \nApplicant owed the IRS a total of $12,000 for tax year 2006. During his October 2017 \nbackground interview, he had admitted he owed $3,550 in Federal taxes for 2008, and \n$2,415 in Federal taxes for 2012.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s position at the hearing was that he no longer owed any Federal taxes \nfor any tax year earlier than 2006, and he will not take any action to resolve those tax \ndebts. He does not currently have any installment agreement in place with the IRS for the \nFederal taxes that he does owe, and has not made any payments to the IRS for the past \nthree years. Applicant failed to provide copies of his tax records during the 30-day period \nthe record was held open. Applicant\u2019s delinquent Federal taxes of about $250,418 are \nunresolved. (Tr. 29-35, 37-42, 54, 57; GE 4-6; AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.f-1.n allege delinquent medical accounts for $1,489, to include \nfour accounts with a balance under $100. Applicant admitted these debts, but he has not \nmade arrangements to pay these outstanding accounts. These delinquent medical \naccounts are unresolved. (Tr. 46-47, 55; GE 2, GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges an unpaid utility account referred for collection in the amount of \n$358. (GE XX) Applicant admitted this debt in his SOR response. There is no evidence \nin the record to show that the debt is paid, or otherwise being resolved. (GE 3) \n \nApplicant is embarrassed about his early tax history and the tax-protestor theories \nhe once followed. He has never participated in financial counseling. He continues to \nfinancially support his son and daughter, and he pays for both of their car payments. His \nstep-son has been involved in a contentious custody battle. Applicant and his wife have \nrecently given him about $12,000 for his legal expenses. He has been unable to make \npayments toward his delinquent financial obligations since he does not have any available \nfunds to do so. Applicant provided no monthly budget or evidence of his monthly income \nand expenses during the 30-day period the record was held open. (Tr. 45-48, 51-52, 57-\n58) \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d  \n \n  \nFrom the 1990s until about 2007, Applicant was a tax protester. He believed the \nfederal tax system was invalid, and that he did not have to file federal tax returns or pay \nfederal taxes. The IRS sent him notices about his responsibilities under Federal tax laws \nand regulations, to no avail. Applicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns \nfor a number of years. That is not alleged in the SOR, but as a result, he failed to pay his \nFederal income taxes and accumulated about $250,418 in past-due Federal tax debt. He \nalso has an unpaid utility account and ten outstanding medical bills. The record \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \n \nSeven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. \n24, 2013). \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s acceptance of tax-protestor \nprinciples demonstrates poor judgment. This is especially apparent considering that he \ncontinued in that practice for a number of years despite the IRS informing him of his legal \nresponsibility to file and pay Federal income taxes. While he had a change of heart in \nabout 2007, and took apparent action to file his past-due returns, his resulting Federal \nincome tax debt remains ongoing and unresolved. There were no circumstances beyond \nhis control that adversely affected his finances. He and his wife made poor financial \ndecisions to the detriment of their unpaid financial responsibilities.  \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nApplicant failed to provide supporting documentation of his actions, if any, to \naddress his past-due taxes. He admitted he has not paid any of the delinquent accounts \nin the SOR, to include four of his unpaid medical debts that were under $100.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has commented that an Applicant\u2019s failure to file income \ntax returns (or, as alleged here, to address resulting tax debt): \n \n . . . suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-\nestablished governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nsuch rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. \nISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted \nin the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same \ntoken, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax returns. \nRather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and \nreliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria \n& Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. \nCir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nApplicant expressed embarrassment over his prior views about the federal tax \nsystem. Even so, he does not currently have a plan in place with the IRS to address his \nextensive delinquent Federal tax debt. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to explain \nwhy he was unable to make payments or otherwise resolve the debts in the SOR. There \nis no evidence that he received financial counseling, or that he initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay his financial obligations, tax-related or otherwise. Applicant failed to provide \ndocumentation that he has a legitimate basis to dispute any of his outstanding accounts, \nand the debts remain unpaid and unaddressed. Applicant failed to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old systems engineer who has been employed by the same \ndefense contractor since 2011. His annual salary is approximately $100,000. He has \ntaken side jobs over the past four years, and has earned an additional $10,000 - $15,000 \nper year. \n \nApplicant did not present sufficient mitigating evidence. He does not have a \npayment plan established with IRS to address his significant Federal tax debt. When a \ntax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider factors such as the \norigin of the tax debts, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin \nand complete making payments. By his own admission, Applicant has not made any \npayments to the IRS in the last three years.  \n \nThe primary problem here is that Applicant accepted tax-protestor theories despite \nthe IRS sending him notices that he had a legal requirement to file his Federal income \ntax returns for several years. He chose to ignore those notices. While he later had a \nchange of heart and has expressed embarrassment for his prior views, the resulting \ndelinquent tax debt remains extensive, ongoing, and unresolved. He was also put on \nnotice that he had several unpaid medical accounts and a utility account when he had his \nbackground interview in November 2017, and when the SOR was issued in December \n2018. He failed to take any responsible action to resolve or pay his delinquent debts.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his criminal conduct, traffic infractions, and termination of employment. He has \nrefuted the allegation that he falsified his security clearance application. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 27, 2017. On \nDecember 6, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines J and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 19, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 7, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on April 23, 2019. On May 8, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 10, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, \n2.a, and 2.c. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b. His admissions in his answer and \nat the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old mechanic employed by a defense contractor. (Tr. 21.) \nHe has never held a security clearance. He graduated from high school in June 2012 \nand attended a university for three months. He does not know his biological father, and \nhe was raised by his grandparents. He left home after graduating from high school and \nlived in an apartment with his brother and his brother\u2019s girlfriend. He was evicted from \nthe apartment because of noise coming from the apartment, apparently because of loud \narguments between his brother and his brother\u2019s girlfriend, and he began living in his \ncar. He now rents a house owned by his grandfather. (GX 4 at 2; Tr. 28-29.) He has \nnever married, but he has a six-year-old son. (GX 1 at 21, 24.) \n \nApplicant worked as a cook at a retirement facility from October 2012 to October \n2015. He was fired because he was late for work twice and failed to have his badge with \nhim when he clocked in. He explained that he was late for work because he was living \nin his car, overslept, and had problems with an unreliable car. He failed to swipe in with \nhis identification card because he had lost it. (GX 4 at 3-4.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed for two months and then worked as a cook at a golf \ncourse from November 2015 to February 2017. He worked for a defense contractor as a \nmarine painter from February 2017 to September 2017, when he was laid off due to \nbudget cuts. He worked for a defense contractor as a maintenance helper from January \nto June 2018. (GX 4 at 3-4.) His supervisor submitted a letter of recommendation for \nhim, describing him as bright, personable, highly motivated, and a \u201cvaluable resource.\u201d \n(AX A.) Since September 2018, he has been employed by another defense contractor. \nHis most recent supervisor submitted a letter of recommendation describing him as \nhaving a great attitude and a sense of urgency. (AX C.).  \n \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant was involved in an altercation with his then \ncohabitant, when she tried to prevent him from moving out. She began hitting him as he \ngathered up his possessions, and he grabbed her around the waist to prevent her from \nhitting him. His cohabitant\u2019s sister called the police and accused him of choking his \ncohabitant. The police arrested him for domestic assault and battery. His cohabitant \n\n \n3 \n \ndenied that Applicant had choked her. Applicant and his then cohabitant agreed to have \nno contact with each other, and the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 3; GX 4 at 2; \nTr. 25.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in June 2017, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions \nasking whether, during the last seven years, he had been issued a summons, citation, \nor ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding; had been arrested by any law-\nenforcement official; or had been charged, convicted, or sentenced for a crime in any \ncourt. He did not disclose that he was arrested and charged with domestic assault and \nbattery in September 2015. In May 2018, he told a security investigator that he did not \ndisclose his arrest and charge of domestic assault and battery because he did not \nunderstand the question. He fully disclosed the incident to the security investigator. (GX \n4 at 3; Tr. 29.) In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he stated that he thought \nhe was required to disclose only arrests that resulted in convictions, and he did not \ndisclose the arrest for domestic assault and battery because he was not convicted. \n(SOR Answer; Tr. 30.) \n \n \nBetween April 13, 2018 and April 2, 2018, Applicant was charged with or cited for \nthe following motor-vehicle offenses: \n \nOFFENSE \nDATES \nDISPOSITION (GX 2) \nDriving without a license \nApril 13, 2013  \nApril 28, 2013  \nOctober 18, 2013 \n$50 fine  \n$100 fine  \n$100 fine  \nDriving an uninsured vehicle November 21, 2013 \n$100 fine \nDriving on a suspended or \nrevoked driver\u2019s license \nNovember 21, 2013;  \nJanuary 12, 2014;  \nMay 3, 2014;  \nJuly 30, 2014 \nJail 4 days; probation  \nJail 90 days (suspended); $50 fine \n$100 fine \n$100 fine  \nSeat-belt violation \nJune 17, 2016 \n$25 fine  \nSpeeding 40 miles per hour \n(mph) in a 25-mph zone \nNovember 21, 2013 \n$90 fine  \nSpeeding 52 mph in a 35-\nmph zone \nJanuary 12, 2014 \nDismissed \nSpeeding 39 mph in a 25-\nmph zone \nMay 14, 2016 \n$84 fine  \nSpeeding 49 mph in a 35-\nmph zone \nJune 27, 2016 \n$84 fine  \nSpeeding 74 mph in a 55-\nmph zone \nApril 2, 2018 \nPrepaid fine, amount not reflected \nin record \n \n \nEven though the seat-belt violation and speeding tickets were alleged under \nGuideline J, the court records reflect that the seat-belt violation and speeding tickets \nwere civil infractions and not criminal offenses. As such, they should have been alleged \nunder Guideline E, and I have considered them under that guideline. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he initially did not bother to obtain a driver\u2019s license due to \nimmaturity and inexperience. He needed transportation to his job, and needed to work \nbecause he had a newborn son. (Tr. 22.) He now holds an unrestricted driver\u2019s license. \nHe attached documentation to his answer to the SOR, reflecting that all fines and court \ncosts had been paid.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandfather, with whom he lived while growing up, submitted a letter \ndescribing Applicant\u2019s involvement in youth activities. Applicant has volunteered to \nserve as an equipment and uniform specialist and an assistant coach three to five days \na week. He has a reputation for being dependable, honest, loyal, and hardworking. (AX \nB.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Applicant\u2019s record of traffic-related criminal conduct raises the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s last criminal offense was in July 2014, \nalmost five years ago.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the domestic assault and battery charge alleged in \nSOR \u00b61.a. It is not established for the other offenses alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is established. Applicant\u2019s last criminal offense was almost five years \nago, and he has earned the respect of two recent employers and is actively involved in \ncommunity activities.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the charge of domestic assault alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nand the traffic offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant \nfalsified his SCA by failing to disclose that he was charged with the domestic assault \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges Applicant\u2019s termination of employment for \ntardiness and loss of his identification card. The concern under this guideline is set out \nin AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \n\n \n7 \n \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: : . . (3) a \npattern of. . . rule violations . . . . \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \nApplicant is young, has limited formal education, and no previous experience \nwith the security clearance process. Under the circumstances, I found his explanation \nfor not disclosing the unfounded charge of domestic assault plausible and credible. \nAccordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established by his failure to disclose it in \nhis SCA.  \n \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s traffic infractions under this guideline, along with \nhis termination of employment for tardiness and losing his identification card. These \nincidents are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s traffic offenses were minor \ninfractions and the last speeding ticket was more than a year ago. His termination of \nemployment was for minor infractions and was more than three years ago. Applicant \nhas acknowledged that his behavior was immature, and he appears to have matured, to \nthe extent that his current and previous supervisors submitted letters strongly \nsupporting his application for a security clearance.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was well-prepared, \nsincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. I was impressed by the favorable \nrecommendations from two recent employers. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines J and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his criminal conduct and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Cervi, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 12, 2018, \nrequesting renewal of a Department of Defense (DOD) security clearance. On December \n6, 2018, the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant responded to the SOR on January 8, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.1  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 16, 2019, scheduling \n                                                          \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n \nthe hearing for June 3, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \nand Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B were admitted without objection. In post-hearing \nsubmissions, Applicant submitted several documents marked together as AE C that were \nadmitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old logistics management specialist, employed by a \ngovernment contractor since 2017. She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. She \nmarried in 2009 and divorced in 2018. She has two children, ages 12 and 4. Applicant \ncurrently holds a security clearance, granted in 2013. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to file Federal income tax returns for tax years \n2014 to 2016. Applicant admitted the SOR allegation, and provided an explanation with \nher answer. While married, Applicant\u2019s spouse filed joint Federal income tax returns. Her \nspouse\u2019s business began to show distress in 2014, and he delayed in filing the joint \nreturns. They also began to experience marital difficulties. As a result, Applicant\u2019s 2014 \nto 2016 Federal income tax returns were not filed when due. \n \n \nApplicant typically did not question her spouse about his business and family \nfinancial issues, and she did not know she could file individual, but married, tax returns. \nHer divorce was finalized in January 2018, and she hired a tax accountant to assist her \nwith past-due returns. Her accountant advised that filing a joint return was advantageous. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-spouse refused to cooperate with her to provide documentation for her to \nfile the past-due returns, but her accountant was able to convince him that his ex-spouse\u2019s \nsecurity clearance was in jeopardy. He provided the information, and Applicant filed all \npast-due returns by March 2019. The IRS owes Applicant a total refund of about $3,070. \nTax returns for 2017 and 2018 were filed on time, with nothing owed. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she learned from this experience, and she is a different, \nmore assertive person than she was when she was married. She registered to attend the \nsoonest possible class offering financial counseling; a seminar to learn about budgeting, \ncontrolling expenses, and eliminating debt. She is also able to meet all of her monthly \nexpenses, and has about $200 per month remaining. She has savings and retirement \naccounts valued at about $2,200, and she is making required monthly payments on a \nmedical debt. She is strongly supported by her work colleagues, including her deputy \ndivision chief, friends, and family. They describe her as an honest, dependable, and \ntrustworthy professional, and a superb mother and friend. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n3 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n4 \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to file Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 to 2016, when \ndue. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant did not ensure that her Federal tax returns were filed when due, for tax \nyears 2014 to 2016, while she was married. She relied on her spouse to file the joint tax \nreturns, and when she divorced, she was unsuccessful in collecting the necessary \ninformation from him to file past-due returns. Applicant\u2019s accountant was able to convince \nher ex-husband to provide the information, and Applicant filed the returns in March 2019. \nShe is owed about $3,070 in refunds. \n \n \nApplicant has taken responsible action to gain control over her tax filings. She \nretained the services of an accountant, and she filed past-due returns. Her returns for \n2017 and 2018 were filed on time, and no tax is owed. She also registered to attend a \nfinancial counseling course. She has sufficient income to meet her current financial \nobligations, and is building her savings. I believe Applicant\u2019s finances and tax obligations \nare now firmly under control and will remain so in the future. I find that her past tax issues \nno longer cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (g) are applicable. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s testimony, documents provided during and after the \nhearing, her financial challenges as a result of her marriage and divorce, and the support \nfrom her colleagues, family and friends. Applicant has shown current financial \nresponsibility and appears to have full control of her finances and tax obligations. She is \nable to meet her financial obligations and has resolved her Federal tax issues \nsatisfactorily.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nGregg A.

On May 24, 2017, Applicant applied for a public trust \nposition and submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP). \nOn December 14, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all \ncovered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017.  \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct). It also detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was \nunable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant to Applicant eligibility for occupying a public trust position to \nsupport a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended the matter be referred to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether the eligibility should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.   \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nOn May 2, 2019, the Government issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) with \nseven attachments (\u201cItems\u201d). Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on July 9, 2019. Based on my review of the record as a whole, I find \nApplicant mitigated criminal conduct and personal conduct trustworthiness concerns. \n \n  \n \n \n \n Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old male. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 2010. He has \nworked for the same employer for nearly eight years, most recently as a senior escalation \nlead. Applicant married in 2012. When interviewed in July 2018, he noted that he intended \nto divorce his wife after the birth of their third child, which they were then expecting. \n(FORM, Item 5 at 2-4).  \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant first applied for a public trust position and submitted an \nelectronic questionnaire for investigations processing. In July 2018, he disclosed to \ninvestigators that he had been issued a summons to appear in court in January 2017 after \nhis wife accused him of domestic violence assault. His wife ultimately recanted her \ncomplaint, and the domestic assault charge was dropped to a littering violation that \nrequired him to pay a $400 fine.  \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant and his wife engaged in a fight over the legitimacy \nof their children. The then-pregnant wife alleged that Applicant threw a laundry basket at \nher during their exchange. When he tried to leave during the fight, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nbehavior turned sexual as she ripped open his shirt, forced her hands into his pants, and \ncaused him to fall into pictures on the wall. (Item 7 at 10) He struggled to extricate himself \nfrom the increasingly sexualized situation before his groin was inadvertently struck. In \ntrying to avoid contact with, or harm to, his pregnant wife and escape the encounter, he \nhit his head on his way to his car. He then drove to the police station and filed a report. \nHe was given an escort back to his home to collect his clothing. He filed for a legal \nseparation the following day. After two weeks, however, the two reconciled in an attempt \nto save the marriage. The police never determined who was the primary aggressor in the \nunderlying incident. \n \nIn May 2018, the police arrived at Applicant\u2019s home on response to a call \nconcerning a complaint of domestic assault involving a knife. This occurred after Applicant \nand his wife fought as she attempted to pack her van with a load of their children\u2019s \nclothing, threatening to leave Applicant. Applicant, in turn, blocked her way out of the \ndoor. She pulled a knife on Applicant, which he tried to grab from her. Ultimately, she was \nunarmed and fled the scene. Applicant contacted the police. The primary aggressor in the \nmatter was never determined by the police.   \n \nApplicant later noted that he had filed five or six police reports against his wife over \nthe years due to domestic violence incidents. He also disclosed that he had separated \nfrom his wife and planned to file for divorce. The records reflect that one town\u2019s police \nrecords contain at least three domestic violence complaints between the spouses that led \nto police reports in the past two-and-a-half years: from January 17, 2017, September 8, \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n2017, and May 13, 2018. (FORM, Item 7) The records show that both spouses at varying \ntimes were bruised or injured in relation to their conflicts, with the majority of photographic \nevidence pertaining to Applicant. (see, e.g., FORM, Item 7 at 11, 13, and 20)  \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant completed the e-QIP noted above. Applicant answered \n\u201cno\u201d in response to Section 22 \u2013 Police Record: \n \nIn the past seven (7) years have you been issued a summons, citation, or \nticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against you? In the past \nseven (7) years have you been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, \nmarshal, or any other type of law enforcement official? I n the past seven \n(7) years have you been charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any \ncourt? In the past seven (7) years have you been or are you currently on \nprobation or parole? Are you currently on trial or awaiting a trial on criminal \ncharges? \n \nBy answering this section in the negative, Applicant failed to disclose the January 2017 \ncharge for domestic violence assault.  \n \nWhile Applicant admits the criminal allegations concerning his marital discord, he \ndenied deliberately falsifying or attempting to mislead in answering \u201cno\u201d to Section 22 in \n2017. At the time, he had asked his attorney whether he had to disclose the 2017 incident \non his 2017 e-QIP. \u201cHe informed [Applicant] that his situation was lowered to a littering \ncharge which I paid. This was the extent of the conversation, and [Applicant] thought that \ngoing forward, that was all [he[ would need to disclose.\u201d (SOR Response) Applicant \napologizes for his inaction, stresses that he had no intention to deceive or falsify, and \nfirmly believed the matter was settled and the summons voided. \n \nPolicies \n \nIn this matter, The Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017, is controlling. The DOD considers \nADP positions to be \u201csensitive positions.\u201d For a person to be eligible for sensitive duties, \nthe person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness must be such that assigning the \nperson to a sensitive position is clearly consistent with the national security interests of \nthe United States. AG \u00b6 2.c. Applicants for ADP positions are entitled to the procedural \nprotections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination is made. \n(Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum for the Director, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals, dated November 19, 2004)  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n  \nA public trust position decision resolves whether it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation. The Government must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. If it does, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. The applicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nor continue his or her access to sensitive information.  \n \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national security as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security\u201d standard requires that \u201cany doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). An eligibility for a public trust position decision \nis not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. It is merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing access to sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant admitted that he was involved in the three cited incidents of marital \ndiscord, for which he was once charged with domestic violence assault. Such facts give \nrise to disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nThe concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factor: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nThe domestic disputes at issue arose because of the volatility that had developed \nin the marriage of Applicant and his wife. For one incident, Applicant was initially charged \nwith domestic violence assault based on Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s accusations, but she ultimately \nrecanted her claim and the charge was dropped. In the other two incidents at issue, it was \nApplicant who reported the incident to the police and Applicant was not charged. Injury \ninflicted on him is documented, not merely anecdotal, as is the fact he disarmed his wife \nin one fight. Applicant has chosen to pursue divorce over marital counseling, thus \nassuring a more immediate solution to their tensions. In the interim, separation should \nsignificantly reduce the chances of similar conduct being repeated. AG \u00b6 32(a) applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying. \nHere, Applicant admits he was involved in the three domestic disputes noted in the SOR \nas occurring in January 2017, September 2017, and May 2018. He acknowledged that \nhe did not detail the January 2017 incident in his May 2017 e-QIP.  If this failure to disclose \nwas purposeful, there is sufficient cause to raise disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s persona, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n \nThis guideline provides seven potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. One \nis potentially applicable under these facts: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n \nHere, Applicant was involved in the three marital altercations previously discussed. \nThe results of those incidents are noted above. In addition, he failed to disclose the first \nof these incidents on his 2017 e-QIP. The facts do not show, however, that this failure to \ndisclose was the result of bad faith, an intentional falsity, or an attempt to obfuscate. The \nallegations concerning the e-QIP do not raise a disqualifying condition. Therefore, taking \nall the issues raised under this guideline, any established concerns (i.e., those involving \nthe domestic disputes) are mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nadjudicative process factors listed in the AG. Under AG \u00b6 2(a), the need to utilize a \u201cwhole-\nperson\u201d evaluation is set forth. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated \nmy comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old senior escalation lead. He has earned a master\u2019s degree \nand maintained steady employment for the past eight years. Married in 2012, Applicant \nhas three children. Troubles with his marriage helped lead to the security concerns raised \nin this case. \n \nBetween 2017 and 2018, Applicant was in three domestic disputes with his \nspouse. He was charged with domestic violence assault for the first incident, but his wife \nrecanted her complaint and the assault charge was dropped. In the other two incidents, \nit was Applicant who was injured, diffused the situation, and contacted the police. \nRealizing this pattern could not continue, he separated. He will divorce his wife after she \ndelivers the baby with whom she was pregnant at the time his last statements were taken.  \n \nIn 2018, Applicant completed an e-QIP in which he failed to disclose his charge for \ndomestic violence assault. In doing so, he did not seek to falsify facts or obfuscate. \nRather, he was advised that the matter had been reduced to a littering charge, so he \nconcluded that he had no need to report the incident. There is nothing indicating falsity in \nhis explanation. Taken together, I find that Applicant mitigated both criminal conduct and \npersonal conduct concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel\n      For Applicant: Pro se      \n_____________\n Decision\n  ______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, I conclude that Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his alcohol consumption. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn December 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative\nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/29/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 3, 2019. He elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on February 5, 2019, and interposed no objections to the materials in\nthe FORM. He timely supplemented the FORM with additional information about his\nalcohol consumption on March 5, 2019. Applicant\u2019s submission was accepted without\nobjection as Item 7. The case was assigned to me on March 22, 2019. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline G, Applicant allegedly was involved in five alcohol-related\nincidents between July 1984 and March 2016. Allegedly he was (a) employer-referred to\nan alcohol treatment facility following his fall in March 2016, as a condition of his return to\nwork; (b) received treatment at the treatment facility for diagnosed alcohol use disorder-\nsevere from July 2016 to September 2016; and (c) evaluated by a licensed clinical\npsychologist in October 2018 and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-mo  d  e  r a  t e  .      \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR\nwith explanations. He claimed the three alcohol-related incidents between 1984 and 1994\nare aged. He claimed that the partial withdrawal symptoms he experienced in the alcohol\ntreatment facility in March 2016 were caused by a combination of prescribed sleep aid\nAmbian and high doses of pain medication. Further, he claimed that all of the group\nmembers being treated at the alcohol treatment facility were required to attend meetings\nconvened by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). \nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year-old engineering manager for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional\nfindings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant never married and has no children. (Items 3-4) He earned a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in May 1997 from an accredited university and a master\u2019s degree from another\nrespected university in engineering management in January 1999. (Item 3) Applicant\nreported no military service. Since October 2000, Applicant has worked for his current\ndefense contractor as an engineer in various capacities, most recently as an engineering\nmanager. (Items 3-4) \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol history\nBetween 1984 and 1994, Applicant was involved in four alcohol-related incidents.\n(Items 2-4) In two of the incidents (1984 and 1986), he was charged with drinking in \npublic. In September 1989, records confirm that he was arrested and charged with driving\nwhile intoxicated (DWI). In court, he was ordered to complete alcohol education classes in\na state-sponsored alcohol safety action program (VASAP), which he completed. And, in\n2\n\nOctober 1994, he was arrested and charged with DWI, reckless driving, and refusal of a\nblood-alcohol content (BAC) test at the scene. Appearing in court, he was ordered to\ncomplete alcohol education classes at his state\u2019s VSAP. (Items 2-4) Applicant is credited\nwith completing this program.\n         In March 2016, Applicant was hospitalized after he fell and broke both legs.(Items4-\n5) Hospital personnel noted that Applicant displayed symptoms of alcohol withdrawal\nwhile he was hospitalized. (Items 4-5) While receiving physical therapy for a little over two\nmonths (July 2016 to September 2016) at a local treatment facility, he was out of work\nand receiving disability benefits. (Items 4-5) While in outpatient treatment at this facility,\nhe told treatment providers that he would regularly consume six to eight measured drinks\nnightly during the weekdays and up to a pint of hard liquor and beer on weekends. (Item\n5) A licensed substance abuse provider at the facility diagnosed him with alcohol use\ndisorder-severe and mandated him to participate in six weeks of group therapy and\nsubmit to random drug and alcohol testing for a year after the incident. (Items 5-6) During\ntreatment he was mandated to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and remain\nabstinent. After treatment ended, facility providers recommended that he continue to\nadhere to an abstinence regimen. (Items 5-6). With this advice, Applicant still continued to\ndrink after completing his outpatient treatment regimen, albeit at a reduced rate. (Item 6)\nBecause his March 2016 accident involved alcohol, Applicant\u2019s employer required\nthat he attend alcohol-related counseling before he would be permitted to return to work.\nApplicant, in turn, was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist in October 2018.\n(Item 6) After taking personal history from Applicant and administering tests to him, Dr. A\ndiagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder-moderate. (Item 6) \nBased on her evaluation and diagnosis, Dr. A assigned a poor prognosis without\nsustained abstinence by Applicant. (Item 6) By Applicant\u2019s own accounts in his March\n2017 interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and\nin his more recent 2018 evaluation session with Dr. A, he continues to drink, albeit in\nreduced amounts. (Items 4 and 6) To what extent he continues to drink is unclear, and\ncannot be answered without more updates from Applicant.\nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\n3\n\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nAlcohol Consumption\n              \nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  AG \u00b6 AG 21.\n    B  urden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\n4\n\nsecurity clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be\nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant comes to these proceedings with a considerable history of alcohol-\nrelated incidents over a 34-year period dating to 1984. Between July 1984 and October\n1994, he was arrested for four alcohol-related offenses and pled guilty to three. Principal\nsecurity issues raised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses covered\nby Guideline G, and his more recent treatment and evaluation by licensed mental health\nproviders following a fall in March 2016.\nAlcohol Consumption concerns\n         Applicant\u2019s completion of a employer-directed alcohol treatment program in July-\nAugust 2016 followed his recurrent alcohol-related incidents over a 25-year period. His\nhistory of alcohol-related incidents and ensuing diagnoses and qualified prognoses by\nlicensed clinicians raise concerns over his risk of future alcohol abuse and warrant\napplication of several disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for alcohol consumption\n(AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: DC \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such\nas driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use\nor whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder,\u201d 22(c)\n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder,\u201d and DC 22(d),\n\u201c\u201ddiagnosis by a duly qualified mental health professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder,\u201d fully\napply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nApplicant\u2019s completion of an employer-directed treatment program in July 2016\nand employer-referral for alcohol evaluation in October 2018 included both diagnoses\nand prognoses. Professional evaluators at the outpatient health clinic and Dr. A\u2019s facility\ndiagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder that ranged from severe (the health clinic\nevaluator\u2019s assessment to moderate (Dr. A\u2019s diagnosis). Both evaluators assigned  poor\n5\n\nprognoses for so long as Applicant elected to continue drinking. At this time, it is not\nclear how much alcohol Applicant consumes weekly, or his frequency of use.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s long history of alcohol-related arrests, the more recent\nfindings of his substance abuse alcohol evaluators, and his own acknowledgments of his\ncontinued consumption of alcohol, albeit at reduced rates, none of the potentially\navailable mitigating conditions are available to Applicant. At this time, it is too soon to\nmake safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid abusive drinking in the\nfuture.\nWhole-person assessment\nApplicant\u2019s lengthy civilian service with his employer (over 18 years) is respected\nand appreciated. Endorsements from his current employer and from others who know\nhim were not provided and cannot be evaluated for probative value. Considering the\nrecord as a whole, safe predictions cannot be made at this time about Applicant\u2019s ability\nto avoid alcohol-related incidents in the foreseeable future and abstain from drinking in\ncompliance with his professional evaluators. Alcohol concerns are not mitigated. \n                                               Formal Findings\n           In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:\n         Against Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, conclusions\nare warranted that it is not  clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or contin-\nue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

(Tr. at 17-27, 39, 65; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant and her then husband filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in May 2016. \nUnder Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $12,700 owed \non an auto loan. Under Schedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the \npetition listed $5,500 owed to the IRS for 2012 income taxes; $2,500 owed to their state \nfor 2012 income taxes; and $400 for 2013 state income taxes.

(Tr. at 21-23, 50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 3) \n \n \nThe bankruptcy records indicate that the IRS asserted $3,663 in claims for 2012, \nwhich included $2,015 in taxes; $364 in interest; and $1,283 in penalties. The state \nasserted $2,834 in claims, which included taxes, interest, and penalties for tax years \n2012 and 2013. In June 2016, Applicant and her husband filed a motion to voluntarily \ndismiss the case. The case was dismissed in August 2016. Applicant stated that by that \ntime, she knew that she was not going to remain in the marriage and bankruptcy was \nimpractical. (Tr. at 23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the Chapter 13 bankruptcy; $5,500 owed to the IRS for tax year \n2012; $2,500 owed to the state for tax year 2012; $11,320 owed on a charged-off auto \nloan; an auto loan that was $877 past due, with a $12,426 balance; 5 miscellaneous \ndelinquent debts totaling $1,410, and 14 defaulted student loans totaling about $78,600. \nApplicant admitted owing all the debts with the exception of the state and federal \nincome taxes and the past-due auto loan. \n \n \nApplicant established that she does not owe any federal income taxes. She \ndocumented that $2,397 was withheld from her $3,641 refund from 2017 to satisfy her \n2012 taxes. She received the remaining refund of $1,243, which indicates she did not \nowe any additional taxes. She provided a copy of her 2019 tax transcript that showed \nher $4,832 refund was withheld and applied to a non-IRS debt. (Tr. at 32-34, 56-57; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C, D, Z, AA) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant owed $1,306 in state income taxes for 2012 and $369 for 2013, for a \ntotal of $1,675.

She anticipates a \nrefund of $1,085 to be withheld for her back taxes, leaving a balance of $345. She \nhopes her ex-husband will pay the balance as part of the divorce decree. She will pay it \nif he does not. (Tr. at 34; GE 2; AE C, P, Q) \n \n \nApplicant rehabilitated her student loans. They were consolidated into one loan \ntotaling $83,472 in March 2019. She is current on her $327 monthly payments. As of \nAugust 2019, the balance was $80,005. (Tr. at 30-31, 75-77; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2, 4-6; AE C, E, F) \n \n \nApplicant entered into a payment agreement in August 2019 with the company \ncollecting the $403 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. She agreed to pay $67 per month for six \nmonths. She made the first payment in September 2019. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 4-6; AE C, G, H) \n \n \nApplicant settled the $232 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m for $130, payable in five \nmonthly $26 payments, commencing in October 2019. She paid the $130 settlement \namount in full in September 2019. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE C, I) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges an auto loan that was $877 past due, with a $12,426 balance. \nApplicant was rear-ended by another car in December 2016. Her car was a total loss. \nHer insurance company valued the car at $11,125, but the loan payoff was $11,729. \nThe insurance company negotiated with the creditor to accept $11,125 as a settlement \nof the loan. The creditor accepted the settlement and released the lien to the insurance \ncompany, thereby ending Applicant\u2019s liability for the loan.

She agreed to pay $50 per month for six \nmonths. She made the first payment in September 2019. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 4-6; AE C, L) \n \n \nApplicant has worked for her company since 2017, but she has only been \nearning a good salary and able to address her financial difficulties for about a year. Her \ncurrent financial situation is much better. She paid or is paying debts that were not \nalleged in the SOR. There are three SOR debts she has not yet addressed, primarily \nthe $11,320 owed on a charged-off auto loan. She hopes her ex-husband will pay half \nof the debt. She stated that she will start paying it in 2020, with or without her ex-\nhusband\u2019s help. She credibly stated that she is committed to maintaining her finances in \norder and paying her debts. (Tr. at 28, 38-48, 64-75; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1, 2, 4-6; AE C) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nApril 2017. She reported her Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, two defaulted auto loans, and \nthat she had sought financial counseling \u201cto get [her] financials back on track.\u201d She did \n\n \n4 \n \nnot report owing any state or federal income taxes because she was not completely \naware of the tax issues. She credibly stated that she did not intentionally provide false \ninformation about her finances on the SF 86. (Tr. at 32-33, 50-56; Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 1, 2) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid federal and state \ntaxes, defaulted student loans, and delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nApplicant and her then husband filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in May 2016. \nThe case was voluntarily dismissed in August 2016. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy case \ndoes not raise security concerns independent of the concerns raised by the unpaid \ntaxes and delinquent debts in other allegations. SOR \u00b6 1.a is concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n6 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband used illegal drugs, could not hold a job, and was \nabusive. He destroyed much of her property and left her with almost nothing from the \nmarriage except debt and her child, for whom he does not pay child support. \n \n \nApplicant made the best of a bad situation. She separated, divorced, and \nobtained a restraining order against her ex-husband. She then set about putting her and \nher child\u2019s lives back together. She obtained a good job and started addressing her \nfinancial problems. Her federal taxes have been paid through withholding of refunds, \nand her state taxes have been partially paid. She rehabilitated her student loans \nthrough a consolidation loan, and she is current on her $327 monthly payments. She \nestablished that one of the auto loans was paid by her insurance company. She paid \ndebts that were not alleged in the SOR. She paid or is paying all but three of the \nremaining debts in the SOR. She credibly stated that she is committed to maintaining \nher finances in order and paying her debts. \n \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in her intentions to pay her debts. There \nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved and is under control. I find that \n\n \n7 \n \nshe has a plan to resolve her financial problems, and she took significant action to \nimplement that plan. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information about her taxes on her \n2017 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns and mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.x: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

DOD acted under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 23, 2019. The evidence \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 3-6 (Items 1 and 2 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on \nFebruary 6, 2019. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file objections, but she \n04/02/2019\n\n \n2 \n \noffered exhibits (AE) A-C, which were admitted into evidence without objection.

Her \nadmissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nthis employer since October 2009. She has earned college credits and holds technical \ncertifications. She is married for the second time and has three adult children. Her \nhusband is sporadically employed as a contractor and experienced severe medical \nissues in 2016.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed 15 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$27,091. The debts included a repossessed vehicle and consumer debts. The \nallegations are supported by credit reports from November 2017 and October 2018, her \nanswers to questions from a defense investigator in September 2018 (PSI), and \nadmissions in her SOR answer.2  \n \n \nApplicant explained that she got behind on her debts because of her husband\u2019s \nunemployment, requiring her to pay all their bills from her earnings. In her PSI, she \nacknowledged contact by the various creditors, but she failed to respond due to her \ninability to repay the debts. She documented completing a 30-minute financial \nconsultation with a money coach in March 2019. The consultation included describing \nstrategies to deal with her debt problems. She did not provide any documentation \nshowing that she had paid any of the debts, or that she had entered into any payment \nagreements with any creditors. She did not provide documentation to dispute any debts. \nHer debts remain unresolved.3 \n \n \nApplicant did not provide any information about her current financial situation or a \nbudget. She provided three character letters from coworkers. She is described as a \ndedicated, hardworking, and trusted employee.4   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \n                                                          \n1 Items 2-3. \n \n2 Items 2, 4-6. \n \n3 Item 2, 4; AE A-B. \n \n4 AE C. \n\n \n3 \n \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n \n4 \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant incurred 15 delinquent debts that remain unpaid. I find both the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s husband had \nperiods of unemployment, but she failed to present evidence that she acted responsibly \nin addressing her delinquent debts. She presented no evidence of taking any action to \ncontact creditors, set up payment plans, or pay the debts. There is some evidence of \nfinancial counseling. She failed to establish a track record of financial responsibility. \n\n \n5 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered her husband\u2019s unemployment. However, Applicant failed to produce \nevidence of any action taken to address her delinquent debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information. Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On January 4, 2019, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations), G (Alcohol Consumption), and B (Foreign Influence). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective \nwithin the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 14, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non April 10, 2019. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on April 22, \n2019. The case was reassigned to me on April 30, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 4, 2019, scheduling the hearing \nfor June 10, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified \non his own behalf and called one additional witness. The record remained open at \nApplicant\u2019s request for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant submitted \nApplicant Exhibit A in a timely manner, which was also admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 25, 2019. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Kingdom of Thailand (Thailand). Department Counsel provided a six-\npage summary of the facts, supported by seven Government documents pertaining to \nThailand, identified as Hearing Exhibit I. The documents provide elaboration and context \nfor the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government \nreports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable \ndispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. (Tr. 11-12.) \n \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and married for two years. His wife is Thai, and continues \nto live in Thailand. He has received an associate\u2019s degree. He has worked for his current \nemployer since 2015 and wishes to retain national security eligibility for a security \nclearance in connection with that employment.

Since Applicant was living and working \noutside the United States during the entire time at issue here, his taxable income was low \nenough to exempt him from paying taxes. However, that did not mean Applicant was \nexempt from filing tax returns. He stated, \u201cI guess I thought that if I owed nothing - - owed \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nno taxes - - that it wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem that I could just kind of file a few years \ntogether.\u201d He further stated that all of his tax returns have now been filed. His testimony \nwas vague as to how and when all of the subject Federal and state tax returns were filed, \nstating that several years may have been filed together. Applicant further indicated that \nhe was a procrastinator when it came to fulfilling his tax return responsibilities. Finally, \nApplicant admitted that he has knowns since December 2015 of the Government\u2019s \nconcern with regard to his failure to file tax returns. (Tr. 14-22, 41-42; Government Exhibit \n1 at Section 26, Exhibit 2 at 10.) \n \n \nSubsequent to the hearing, Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibit A, consisting of \na group of U.S. mail return receipts, e-filing information, extension of time to file tax return \ninformation, and contact information for his tax preparer. It appears from the exhibit that \nhis 2014 and 2018 tax returns were filed electronically, albeit late. The return receipts \nfrom both the IRS and his state taxing authority are from 2015, 2017, and 2018. It is not \npossible to know, from the documents he submitted, what specific returns were included \nin each mailing. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he abuses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this \nparagraph, with explanations. \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of alcohol abuse. As stated, he has worked at a remote \nlocation for many years and drinking was his leisure-time activity. Until just recently he \nwould drink five to six drinks each weekend day. Applicant\u2019s wife became pregnant in \nearly 2019 and Applicant testified that, because of the pregnancy, he stopped drinking \naltogether in about April 2019. (Tr. 23, 27-28.) \n \n \nApplicant has had several alcohol-related incidents. In 2016 Applicant passed out \nfrom excessive alcohol consumption at least three times. One of these occasions was in \na public place. In addition, in 2017, Applicant again passed out in public from excessive \nalcohol consumption. A passerby found Applicant and called 911. Police and an \nambulance responded and Applicant was transported to the base medical clinic. He \nreceived a citation for public intoxication from the local police and paid a fine. (Tr. 22, 27; \nGovernment Exhibit 2 at 8-9.) \n \n \nThere is evidence that Applicant was sent home from work at least once in 2016 \nfor coming to work with alcohol on his breath. Applicant denied knowledge of such an \nevent, but his second-level supervisor testified that it did happen and Applicant was \ncautioned not to have it happen again. (Tr. 25-26, 42, 49-51.) \n \n \n \n \n\n \nParagraph 3 (Guideline B. Foreign Influence) \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has foreign connections that may subject him to foreign influence or coercion. \nApplicant admitted both allegations under this guideline. \n \n \nAs stated, Applicant has been married for two years to a Thai national. His wife, \nwho is 34, continues to reside in Thailand, where she is pregnant with their first child. \nApplicant met his wife in Thailand in approximately 2008. They dated for nine years, \nprimarily through the internet, until they were married in May 2017. Due to the nature of \nApplicant\u2019s job, he is only able to visit his wife in Thailand twice a year for a period of \nabout 30 days each time. Spouses are not allowed to live at Applicant\u2019s work location. \nApplicant and his wife communicate daily over the internet. (Tr. 31-34.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife works as a loan officer at a credit union in Thailand. Her mother is \na farmer. Applicant\u2019s wife has two sisters, both of whom she is helping support. Applicant \nhas little contact with his wife\u2019s mother or sisters. (Tr. 35-38.)  \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the Marine Corps for four years, from 1995 to 1999. \nHe held a Secret clearance during that time. (Tr. 40.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second-level supervisor testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has known \nApplicant for several years and recommended him for a security clearance. However, the \nwitness also indicated a lack of direct knowledge about the alcohol-related incidents in \nApplicant\u2019s past described earlier in this decision. (Tr. 44-56.) \n \nThailand \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Thailand is a constitutional \nmonarchy, ruled by an interim military government since 2014. The United States has \nurged the restoration of elected civilian government and return to democracy through \nelections. Human rights issues in Thailand include unlawful or arbitrary killings by the \ngovernment or its agents; torture; arbitrary arrest and detention; censorship; restrictions \non political participation; and corruption. Thailand is a key U.S. security ally in Asia, and \nthe country\u2019s stability and growth are important to the maintenance of peace in the region. \nSince World War II, the United States and Thailand have significantly expanded \ndiplomatic, security, and commercial relations. \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \n\n \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns, as required, for \nat least eight years. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying condition, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nWith regard to his taxes, Applicant submitted some evidence that he has filed, \nalbeit late, at least some of his past-due tax returns. However, based on the record \nevidence, it is not possible to know if Applicant has filed all of his delinquent tax returns. \nEven assuming that he has done so, Applicant has been extremely dilatory and showed \na pronounced lack of judgment in connection with this responsibility. There is obviously \nno recent track record of his fulfilling his tax return responsibilities in a timely manner. As \nof now, Applicant did not mitigate his financial issues. Guideline F is found against \nApplicant.  \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions possibly apply to the facts \nin this case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant has a long history of drinking to excess, as shown by the alcohol-related \nincidents set forth in the SOR and discussed above. The last incident was in 2017, \napproximately two years before the record closed in this case. Applicant stated that he \nhas not had anything to drink since approximately April 2019, less than two months before \nthe record closed. He has reported to work with alcohol on his breath at least once in the \nlast three years. All three of the cited conditions apply.   \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions were established in this case. Applicant\u2019s \nproblems with alcohol are of long duration, resulting in several incidents of his passing \nout after drinking. He has showed up for work with alcohol on his breath. His decision to \nstop drinking occurred earlier this year and, while it is apparently sincere, is of very short \nduration. Considering all the available evidence, I find that not enough time has passed \nwithout an incident to establish confidence that he will not resume drinking and acting \nirresponsibly while under the influence. The Alcohol Consumption guideline concerns are \nfound against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 3 (Guideline B, Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife, her mother, and her sisters are citizens and residents of Thailand. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThailand has an authoritarian government, and the country suffers from human-\nrights abuses. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country have the \npotential to generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The DOHA Appeal Board has said that the mere \npossession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign \ncountry and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to \ncreate the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nDue to the nature of his job, Applicant has minimal physical contact with his wife \nand her family in Thailand. However, she is his wife, and is now pregnant with their child. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), and (c) do not apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does apply. Applicant is a native-born American citizen, a former Marine, \nand a long-time Federal contractor. He has deep and long-standing loyalties to the United \nStates. Thailand is a long-time American ally. Under the particular circumstances of this \ncase, I find that Applicant has shown he can resolve any potential conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. The Guideline B allegations are found in favor of Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that he has successfully resolved his alcohol problem, or that \nhe will responsibly file his income tax returns in a timely manner in the future. The potential \nfor pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the evidence creates \nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and suitability for national security eligibility \n\n \nand a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the guidelines for financial considerations and alcohol consumption. \n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

He had \nten alcohol-related incidents between 2001 and 2016. He continued to consume \nalcohol, against medical advice, until at least December 2018. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 19, \n2016. On May 3, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 10, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge (Answer). The Government was ready to proceed on July 31, 2019, \nand the case was assigned to me on August 9, 2019. On August 21, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for September 25, 2019, and I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B were \nadmitted without objection, and Applicant testified. I received the completed transcript \n(Tr.) on October 11, 2019, and the record closed.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 35, is single, and has no children. In 2013, he received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in information and decision science. He held a top secret clearance with \nsensitive compartmented information access (TS/SCI) from 2014 until it was \ndowngraded to a TS security clearance in 2016. He has worked as a senior software \nengineer for a defense contractor since October 2013. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3 at 16; Tr. 9-\n11) \n \n \nApplicant started consuming alcohol in 2000, when he was 15. He would go to \nparties and drink beer to the point of intoxication. Applicant was charged with unlawful \nconsumption of alcohol by a minor in June 2001, July 2002, and January 2003. These \nincidents occurred when he was in high school and within 9 months of his June 2002 \ngraduation. He received fines and was placed on supervision for these incidents. (GE 1 \nat 15; GE 3 at 13; Tr. 23-25) \n \nAfter Applicant turned 21 in 2005, his drinking increased as he was able to go to \nbars. He consumed six to eight drinks a night, once or twice a week. Applicant primarily \nused designated drivers and taxis to get home, but admitted at the hearing that on \noccasion, he drank and then drove in an impaired state. In September 2006, Applicant \nwas charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor after he provided alcohol to \nan underage girl who was at a party at his home. He was unaware that she was \nunderage, but pled guilty, and he was fined, placed on supervision, and required to \nperform community service. (GE 1 at 38-41; GE 3 at 14; GE 5 at 4; Tr. 24, 26-28) \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant\u2019s mother called the police, because he was fighting with \nhis brother in their home. The police came to their home and intervened, giving \nApplicant and his brother verbal warnings. They were both intoxicated, and this \ncontributed to the escalation; however, Applicant denied being arrested and charged \nwith domestic battery. (GE 3 at 22-23; Tr. 24-26) \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with battery by campus police in August \n2011. He went to a bar with friends during an afternoon break from classes and \nconsumed alcohol to the point of intoxication. After returning to campus, he \u201cflung his \nsandal,\u201d which hit another student in the face. As a result of this incident: he was placed \non academic probation for six months; he was required to write a letter of apology to the \nother student; and attend one to two Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings a month for \nthe remainder of the school year. He was 26 at the time of the incident. (Tr. 28-31; GE 1 \nat 33-34, GE 3 at 7-8; GE 5 at 5; 45) \n \nIn October 2011, Applicant received a $250 ticket for having an open bottle of \nbeer at a parade. He was 27 at the time of the incident. (GE 1 at 34; GE 3 at 11-12) \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with three counts of battery and damage to \nproperty in April 2012. He was at a bar consuming alcohol with friends. After his friends \nleft the bar, Applicant got into an argument with another patron, which turned physical. \nApplicant testified the fight escalated to the point that he fought three patrons and a \n\n \n3 \n \nbartender, resulting in him being badly beaten. As the instigator of the fight, he was \nconvicted and ordered to pay a $350 fine, perform 50 hours of community service, and \ncomplete one year of supervised probation. He successfully completed all of these \nterms and reduced his level of drinking to once a month. (GE 1 at 34-36; GE 3 at 12; \nGE 5 at 5-7; Tr. 31-34)  \n \nIn 2014, Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol increased to three nights a week, as \na coping mechanism for a breakup with a girlfriend. In February 2015, Applicant went to \na bar and consumed beer and shots of vodka. The next day, which was a Saturday, he \ntook an Uber ride-share to work. After arriving at work, he fell asleep at his desk. His \ncoworkers woke him and could smell alcohol on his breath. A coworker drove him \nhome. As a result of this incident, his supervisor and facility security officer gave him a \nverbal warning. Applicant knew he was planning to go to the office on Saturday before \nhe consumed alcohol the previous night. (GE 1 at 43-44; GE 2 a 2; GE 3 at 15; Tr. 34-\n36, 39, 56, 60) \n \nAs a result of the February 2015 work incident, Applicant voluntarily went to \nintensive outpatient alcohol-counseling treatment. According to Applicant, he was \ndiagnosed with \u201calcoholism.\u201d He attended three-hour group-counseling sessions three \nnights a week after work. As part of the program, he was required to attend two \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings a week. Once a week he was given a urinalysis. \n(GE 1 at 43-46; GE 3 at 15-16; GE 6; Tr. 35-41)    \n \nIn March 2015, Applicant was discharged two or three weeks early, against \nclinical advice. Applicant testified that he left the program early because he was unable \nto perform his job and attend the nine hours of counseling each week. Additionally, he \nbelieved that he did not need the program. At the time of his discharge, it was \nrecommended that he continue to abstain from alcohol and continue treatment. He did \nnot discuss this issue or ask for accommodations from his supervisor, because he was \nashamed. (GE 1 at 43-46; GE 3 at 15-16; GE 6; Tr. 35-40)  \n \nApplicant abstained from using alcohol from February 2015 until September \n2015. After he was discharged from the treatment program in March 2015, he \ndiscontinued attending AA meetings. In September 2015, Applicant started consuming \nalcohol once or twice a week, because he was under stress at work, and he was \nconcerned about company layoffs. He drank to the point of intoxication once or twice a \nmonth. (GE 1 at 44; GE 3 at 15-16; Tr. 40-42)  \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant moved to a new state for work where he had no friends \nor family. He was lonely and started drinking heavily. A month later, he was arrested \nand charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). While Applicant was driving to work at \nabout 7:00 in the morning he struck a parked vehicle. The night before the incident, he \nwatched hockey with a neighbor, and he consumed alcohol until approximately 2:00 or \n3:00 in the morning. Applicant admitted he was still intoxicated when he drove to work, \nand his blood alcohol content (BAC) was .12. As a result of his conviction: Applicant\u2019s \nlicense was restricted for 12 months; he was required to use an interlock device for six \nmonths; pay fines; and attend 25 ASAP classes. In December 2016, Applicant had an \n\n \n4 \n \ninterlock violation. He claimed this was the result of consuming cough syrup. Applicant \nreported the arrest to his facility security officer (FSO) in a timely manner. (GE 1 at 36-\n37; GE 2 a 2; GE 3 at 12-13, 15-16; GE 5 at 2, 9; Tr. 41-45; 70) \n \nFrom September 2016 until April 2017, Applicant went to alcohol counseling \ntwice a week. His goal during this treatment was to completely abstain from using \nalcohol. His treatment records reflect that he consumed alcohol on New Year\u2019s Eve \n2016 and at a Super Bowl party in February 2017. Applicant acknowledged in group \ncounseling sessions that he had these \u201cslips\u201d and consumed alcohol. He had several \nurinalyses that were positive for medications for which he did not have prescriptions, \nand he had one urinalysis that was positive for alcohol. (GE 3 at 13; GE 5 at 14, 19, 29, \n30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38-40, 43-44; Tr. 36, 45-50)  \n \nAccording to Applicant, the treatment facility recommended that he continue to \nabstain from alcohol, and he was diagnosed with \u201calcoholism.\u201d Applicant\u2019s probation \nended in July 2017, and he resumed consuming alcohol in September 2017, despite the \ntreatment facility\u2019s recommendation that he continue to abstain from all consumption of \nalcohol. (GE 5; Tr. 64-66) \n \nApplicant attended a wedding in September 2017, where he consumed alcohol to \nthe point of intoxication. He testified that he consumed one or two shots at the wedding; \nhowever, in his January 2019 response to DOD interrogatories, he admitted he was \nintoxicated. He also consumed alcohol at Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2017. (GE 2 at \n1; GE 3 at 3, 15, 23; GE 5; Tr. 50-55) \n \nDuring his April 2018 background interview, Applicant claimed he quit drinking \nalcohol in January 2018, and did not intend to consume alcohol in the future, unless he \nwas at a social gathering. In July 2018, he went on a work trip and consumed two \nbeers. He also consumed alcohol at Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2018. At the time of \nthe hearing, he had not consumed alcohol in 2019. He admitted that his most recent \nperiod of abstinence was, in part, the result of the DOD interrogatories and SOR. He \nalso loves how his life is \u201cwithout alcohol controlling it.\u201d Applicant attended an AA \nmeeting approximately two weeks before the hearing and once in August, but has not \nattended any other meetings since April 2017. He attended these meetings upon advice \nfrom an attorney. He has never had an AA sponsor, despite recommendations from the \n2017 treatment. (GE 2 at 1; GE 3 at 3, 15, 23; GE 5; Tr. 50-55, 57-58) \n \nApplicant characterized his consumption of alcohol since July 2017 as \u201cplaying \nwith fire,\u201d but claimed he is no longer interested in drinking, and he intends to continue \nto abstain. In the past when he consumed alcohol, he would almost always drink to the \npoint of intoxication, and he admitted to having a problem with alcohol. Applicant has \nexperienced blackouts, most recently in April 2016. The DWI was a \u201cwake-up call,\u201d and \nhe admittedly shrugged off his alcohol issues \u201cfor far too long.\u201d He admitted that his \nmother and brother have expressed to him their concerns regarding his consumption of \nalcohol. (Tr. 14, 61-64, 66, 76) \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant obtained an alcohol and substance use evaluation in September 2019 \nupon the recommendation of an attorney. The evaluation determined that based upon \nApplicant\u2019s nine months of sobriety and responses to various tests, he was a low risk for \na substance use disorder for the previous 12 months. Additionally, his urinalysis which \nwas administered the week before the hearing was negative for alcohol. (AE A; Tr. 57-\n58) \n \n \nApplicant regularly exercises and seeks out hobby activities as coping \nmechanisms. He has never had a security issue, and he believes he has made \nnecessary positive changes in his life. Applicant informed his supervisor that he had a \nDOHA hearing related to the 2016 DWI. In his 2018 performance evaluation, Applicant \nis described as a key player, hardworking, a subject matter expert, courteous, and \nprofessional. (AE B; Tr. 14, 56, 69)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 are potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence.  \n \n \nBetween June 2001 and April 2016, Applicant was ticketed, charged, or \ninvestigated for nine alcohol-related incidents. Additionally, in February 2015 he was \ngiven a verbal warning for coming to work with alcohol on his breath. As a result of this \nincident he voluntarily attended intensive outpatient alcohol treatment. According to \nApplicant, he was diagnosed with \u201calcoholism,\u201d and he left the treatment early against \nmedical advice. He discontinued attending AA meetings, but abstained from alcohol \nuntil approximately September 2015. In April 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith DWI, he was driving to work prior to the arrest. Once again, he attended alcohol \ntreatment and attempted to abstain. Between September 2016 and April 2017, he \nviolated his probation at least twice by consuming alcohol. Again, according to \nApplicant, he was diagnosed with \u201calcoholism\u201d and was recommended to completely \nabstain from using alcohol. A few months after his probation ended in July 2017, \nApplicant became intoxicated and continued to drink alcohol a few times a year.  \n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s treatment records from the two facilities do not reflect that \nApplicant was diagnosed with an alcohol-related disorder; however, at the hearing he \nacknowledged that he was diagnosed with \u201calcoholism\u201d and both facilities \nrecommended that he abstain from the use of alcohol. Based upon all of the record \nevidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions, AG \u00b6 22(a), 22(b), and 22(c) apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. Two are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nestablished a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant had ten alcohol-related incidents between 2001 and 2016. These \nincidents reflect a pattern of maladaptive alcohol use. Although it has been over three \nyears since his last arrest, Applicant continued to consume alcohol while he was on \nprobation and against medical advice. \n \n \nAfter his alcohol treatment in 2015 and 2017, Applicant was able to maintain \nperiods of sobriety for several months. However, he eventually resumed consuming \nalcohol despite recommendations to maintain complete abstinence. In both instances \nhe stopped attending AA meetings right after he left treatment. This was against the \nrecommendations of the treatment facilities. Additionally, he failed to obtain a sponsor, \ndespite recommendations. Just before his September 2019 hearing, he attended two \nmeetings based upon the advice of an attorney. \n  \n \nApplicant has been sober since approximately January 2019, and he should be \ncommended for this accomplishment; however, given his 20-year history of consuming \nand abusing alcohol, the passage of time is insufficient to mitigate his past history of \nalcohol-related issues and the underlying concerns regarding his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s abstinence since January 2019 is not sufficient to mitigate his \nbehavior given his history of alcohol-related incidents, including two while holding a \nsecurity clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), 23(c), and 23(d) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption:  \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

However, her father and sister were in Russia at the time of her hearing, and \nshe is close to both of them. Foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 2, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On March 12, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). \n \nOn March 20, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) She requested a \nhearing. (Tr. 9-10; HE 4-5) On May 20, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed. On June 21, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On June 28, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for July 9, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant waived her right to 15 days of notice of the \ndate, time, and location of her hearing. (Tr. 12-13) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as \nscheduled on July 9, 2019.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered two exhibits; Applicant offered \nseven exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-2; Applicant Exhibit (AE) \nA-G). On July 18, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.   \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nApplicant changed employment before her hearing, and there was a question \nabout sponsorship for a security clearance. (Tr. 13-14) Her new employer sponsored \nher for a security clearance. (Tr. 13-14; HE 9)  \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Russia and \nIsrael. (Tr. 15-16; HE 6-7) Citing the DOD Personnel Security and Research Center \n(PERSEREC), The Expanding Spectrum of Espionage by Americans, 1947-2015 \n(Technical Report 17-10, August 2017) (PERSEREC Report), Applicant requested \nadministrative notice setting forth comparative data, showing the historical changes in \nthe sources of and the motivation for espionage committed by U.S. citizens. (Tr. 16; HE \n8) Applicant said, \u201cThe data clearly show the steady decline of Russia as a recipient of \ninformation, both in total numbers and in percentage over time. The data show that \ncoercion, as a motivation for espionage, has also declined significantly.\u201d (Tr. 16) The \nPERSEREC Report states the number of people indicating the primary or sole reason \nfor espionage was coercion declined from five (1947-1979) to zero (1980-2015). (HE 8 \nat 4) The most common primary or sole reason for espionage was money at 28% during \nthe most recent period studied (1990-2015), and the second most common primary or \nsole reason for espionage was divided loyalties at 22% during the same period (1990-\n2015). (HE 8 at 5)  \n \nThe PERSEREC Report states: \n \nAs discussed earlier, both the number of naturalized citizens and the \nnumber of divided loyalties as a motive almost doubled in the most recent \ncohort. Naturalized citizens, by definition, would have ties to their country \nof origin, so it is not surprising that most of them have foreign relatives, \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nforeign connections, and/or foreign cultural ties. [There are also] . . . \nnotable percentages of native born American citizens with these ties. \nThese data suggest that while there has been an increase in the number \nof naturalized citizens in the recent cohort of spies, the increase in divided \nloyalties should not be attributed only to them. \n \n(PERSEREC Report at 54-55) During the most recent period studied (1990-2015) of the \ngroup committing espionage-type offenses, \u201cSixty percent were volunteers and 40% \nwere recruited. Among recruits, 60% were recruited by a foreign intelligence service and \n40% by family or friends. Contacting a foreign embassy was the most common way to \nbegin as a volunteer.\u201d Id. at v. The PERSEREC Report only considered 209 individuals, \nand conceded they \u201cconstitute a very small number on which to apply statistical \nanalysis,\u201d and the information is limited to open sources. Id. at 6.  \n \nApplicant objected to the relevance of the information in the Government\u2019s \nrequests for administrative notice because coercion is rarely used to obtain classified \ninformation. (Tr. 29-23; HE 8) I overruled that objection because the Government\u2019s \nadministrative notice request does not indicate whether anyone was coerced into \ncompromising classified information because of family living in Russia. Notwithstanding \nthe lack of evidence of coercion based on relatives living in a foreign country, coercion \ncannot be categorically ruled out, especially in instances where countries do not comply \nwith the rule of law. Moreover, the trend against use of coercion could change in the \nfuture should an adversary of the United States deem it advantageous to apply coercion \nor other inducements to obtain classified information. Finally, it is possible that the \nPERSEREC Report is incomplete as it does not include classified information, and it \nmay not include full information about motivations for espionage. Finally, individuals \narrested for espionage might not be candid about their motivations to commit \nespionage. Thus, the PERSEREC Report has limited value in its applications to \nallegations of foreign influence from Russia. In sum, Applicant\u2019s objections go to the \nweight and not the admissibility of the Government\u2019s administrative notice request. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 \nn. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to \nfacts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE \nLAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative \nnotice). Applicant\u2019s and Department Counsel\u2019s administrative notice requests are \ngranted. Portions of the Department Counsel\u2019s requests are quoted without quotation \nmarks and footnotes. \n \nThe facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of \nwitnesses, names of other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and her \nfamily\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges: Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and sister are citizens of Russia; \nher sister is a resident of Russia and an employee of the Russian Government; and she \nmaintains contact with a friend who is a citizen and resident of Israel. (HE 2) Applicant \nadmitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) She also provided mitigating information. \n(HE 3) Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old logistics and procurement specialist.

(Tr. 53) From 2005 to 2010, she lived in \nRussia, and in 2010, she immigrated to the United States. In 2015, she became a U.S. \ncitizen. (Tr. 49, 79) She has lived at the same address in the United States for nine \nyears. (Tr. 48) She was an intern in the United States for eight months before \nimmigrating to the United States in 2010. (Tr. 49) Applicant said she is willing to \nrenounce her Russian citizenship; however, she has not taken any steps to do so. (Tr. \n53, 77) Applicant attended university in Russia; however, she does not owe any student \nloan debts to the Russian Government. (Tr. 54) She is currently enrolled in a U.S. \nuniversity. (Tr. 56)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents lived in Russia for many years before visiting the United \nStates for six months in 2017. (Tr. 59) Applicant\u2019s father was a mechanic in Russia \nbefore he retired. (Tr. 61) Applicant sponsored her parents for permanent residence in \nthe United States, and in 2018, they returned to the United States and received their \ngreen cards. (Tr. 59-80) Her parents lived with Applicant and her husband when they \nwere in the United States. Applicant speaks excellent English; however, her parents \nspeak little English. (Tr. 31-32) Her father returned to Russia in 2019 for medical \ntreatment because it was less expensive than in the United States. (Tr. 60) Applicant \npaid her father\u2019s expenses to return to Russia.

(AE \nF) Applicant does not have any assets in Russia, and her and her husband\u2019s net worth in \nthe United States is about $800,000. (Tr. 73) In 2019, she received a certificate of \ncompletion for annual insider threat refresher training. (AE G) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nA friend and neighbor, and a friend and coworker described Applicant as \nprofessional, honest, trustworthy, and patriotic. (Tr. 27-46) She is a wonderful mother \nand a loving wife. They support her access to classified information.   \n \nA company vice president and a supervisor described Applicant as an exceptional \nemployee who is diligent, honest, dependable, professional, and who \u201cperformed \nbrilliantly.\u201d (AE A; AE B) She received excellent employee evaluations. (AE C-AE E) \n \nRussia \n \nThe USSR was the principal adversary of the United States during the Cold War \n(1947-1991), after which it broke into Russia and 14 independent republics. Following \neconomic and political turmoil during President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s term (1991-1999), Russia \nshifted toward a centralized authoritarian state under the leadership of President \nVladimir Putin, in which the regime seeks to legitimize its rule through managed \nelections, populist appeals, a foreign policy focused on enhancing the country\u2019s \ngeopolitical influence, and commodity based economic growth. Russia faces a largely \nsubdued rebel movement in Chechnya and other surrounding regions, although \nviolence still occurs through the North Caucasus. \n \nOn July 26, 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center released \nits 2018 Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace Report, in which it reported that \nforeign economic and industrial espionage against the United States continues to \nrepresent a significant threat to the United States\u2019 prosperity, security, and competitive \nadvantage and identified Russia as one of the three most capable and active cyber \nactors tied to economic espionage and the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nproprietary information. It reported that Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument \nof intelligence collection to inform its decision-making and benefit its economic interests, \nand that Russian intelligence services have conducted sophisticated and large-scale \nhacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and technology information. \n \nThe report noted that, \u201c[a]n aggressive and capable collector of sensitive U.S. \ntechnologies, Russia uses cyberspace as one of many methods for obtaining the \nnecessary know-how and technology to grown and modernize its economy.\u201d Other \nmethods of collection include use of Russian commercial and academic enterprises that \ninteract with the West; recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills \nby the Russian intelligence services; and Russian intelligence penetration of public and \nprivate enterprises, which enable the Russian government to obtain sensitive technical \ninformation from industry. \n \nOn February 13, 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) \nissued its Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Statement \nfor the Record, in which it assessed that Russia will employ a variety of aggressive \ntactics to bolster its standing as a great power, weaken the United States, and \nundermine Euro-Atlantic unity; and that Russia will use a range of relatively low-cost \ntools to advance its foreign policy objectives, including influence campaigns, economic \ncoercion, cyber operations, and measured military force. The ODNI also assessed that \nPresident Putin will likely increase his use of repression and intimidation to contend with \ndomestic discontent over corruption, poor social services, and a sluggish economy; he \nwill continue to manipulate the media and is likely to expand the Russian government\u2019s \nlegal basis for repression; and during 2018, Russia will continue to modernize, develop, \nand field a wide range of advanced nuclear, conventional, and asymmetric capabilities \nto balance its perception of a strategic military inferiority vis-a-vis the United States.  \nRussia will also seek to maintain, and where possible, expand its influence through the \nformer Soviet countries that it asserts are in its self-described sphere of influence. \n \nThe ODNI has reported that areas of highest interest to foreign intelligence \ncollectors include energy/alternative energy; biotechnology; defense technology; \nenvironmental protection; high-end manufacturing; and information and communications \ntechnology. In March 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two Russian \nFederal Security Service officials and their Russian cybercriminal conspirators on \ncomputer hacking and conspiracy charges related to the collection of emails of U.S. and \nEuropean employees of transportation and financial services firms. The charges \nincluded conspiring to engage in economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. \n \nThe ODNI has also reported that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. \npresidential election represent the most recent expression of Russia\u2019s long-standing \ndesire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order and noted that \u201cthese activities \ndemonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort \ncompared to previous operations.\u201d The 2016 influence campaign reflected Russia\u2019s \nrecognition of the worldwide effects that mass disclosure of U.S. Government and other \nprivate data have achieved in recent years. The ODNI assessed that Russian \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \nintelligence services will continue to develop capabilities to provide President Putin with \noptions to use against the United States. \n \nThe U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory for Russia is Level 2 - Exercise \nIncreased Caution, due to terrorism, harassment, and the arbitrary enforcement of local \nlaws. The advisory directs U.S. citizens not to travel to the North Caucasus, including \nChechnya and Mount Elbrus, due to terrorism and civil unrest; or to Crimea due to \nRussia\u2019s occupation of the Ukrainian territory and abuses by its occupying authorities. \nTerrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Russia, and may attack with little \nor no warning. U.S. citizens have been arbitrarily interrogated or detained by Russian \nofficials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. Due to \nthe Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia, the \nU.S. Government has reduced ability to provide services to U.S. citizens. \n \nThe Department of State has assessed Moscow as being a high-threat location \nfor terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Although \nRussia continued to prioritize counterterrorism efforts in 2017, it remained a target of \ninternational terrorist groups, particularly ISIS. \n \nRussia maintains an extensive military presence in Crimea and is likely to take \nfurther military actions in Crimea as part of its occupation of this part of Ukraine. The \ninternational community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize \nRussia\u2019s purported annexation of Crimea. In response to Russia\u2019s violations of \nUkraine\u2019s sovereignty, and other acts, the United States suspended most bilateral \nengagement with the Russian government on economic issues. Anti-American and anti-\nWestern rhetoric is widespread in both official media sources and on social media. \n \nIn its 2017 Human Rights Report, the Department of State reported that Russia\u2019s \noccupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula continued to \naffect the human rights situation in Russia significantly and negatively. Credible \nobservers attributed thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as widespread \nabuses, to Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region and to Russian occupation \nauthorities in Crimea. Human rights groups asserted that numerous Ukrainian citizens \nremained in Russia as political prisoners. \n \nThe most significant human rights issues in Russia included extrajudicial killings; \nenforced disappearance; torture that was systematic and sometimes resulted in death \nand sometimes included punitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh and life-threatening \nconditions in prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of judicial independence; \npolitical prisoners; severe interference with privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of \nexpression and the media; increasingly severe restriction on freedom of association, \nincluding laws on \u201cforeign agents\u201d and \u201cundesirable foreign organizations;\u201d and \nwidespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government. The government \nfailed to take adequate steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed \nabuses, resulting in a climate of impunity. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \nCybercrime is also a significant problem across Russia. The risk of infection, \ncompromise, and theft via malware, spam email, sophisticated spear phishing, and \nsocial engineering attacks is significant. Telephone and electronic communications are \nsubject to surveillance at any time without advisory. The Russian System for \nOperational-Investigative Activities permits authorities to monitor and record all data that \ntraverses Russia\u2019s networks. \n \nDepartment Counsel provided examples of Russian intelligence operations within \nthe United States including information about indictments and convictions. There is no \nevidence that Applicant or her family are or were involved in any intelligence operations \nagainst the United States or otherwise. \n \nIsrael \n \nIsrael is a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Israel is a close ally of the United \nStates. The two countries participate in joint military planning and training and have \ncollaborated on military research and weapons development. There have been \nincidents of illegal export, actual or attempted, of dual-use technology form the U.S. to \nIsrael. The United States has disagreed with Israel about its sale of United States and \nIsraeli technologies to other countries, such as China and Russia. Israel has been \nsubjected to numerous attacks from the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. There is a \nsignificant risk of terrorism in Israel.    \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                              \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, and sister are citizens of Russia; her sister is a resident \nof Russia and an employee of the Russian Government; and she maintains contact with \na friend who is a citizen and resident of Israel. Applicant and her mother have frequent \ncontact with her sister who lives in Russia. Frequent contacts are manifestations of an \napplicant\u2019s care and concern for relatives and friends.   \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives or friends living in a \nforeign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if \nan applicant, his or her spouse, or someone living in the same residence have such a \nrelationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nDec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002). Applicant has not denied that she has affection for her immediate family \nmembers.   \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Russia with the United States, and the situation in Russia place a burden \nof persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her relationships with any family \nmember living in or visiting Russia does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not \nbe placed into a position where she might be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and a desire to assist a relative living in or visiting Russia.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with a friend living in Israel is less significant than her \nrelationship with her sister living in Russia because Israel is a democracy, generally \nfollows the rule of law, and is a close ally of the United States.  \n  \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-\n*21 n. 18 (App. Bd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power \nbased on their prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is \nwhether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members \nin a foreign country raise security concerns because those ties and \ncontacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified \ninformation that an applicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers -- has by virtue of a security clearance. A person may be \nvulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, the person\u2019s \nimmediate family members -- regardless of whether the person\u2019s family \nmembers are prominent or not. \n \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Russia seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or her family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a \npossibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Russia has a \nsignificant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in Russia \u201ccould be a \nmeans through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. \ninformation or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Russia or visiting that \ncountry create a potential conflict of interest because Russian intelligence operatives \ncould place pressure on or offer inducements to her family in Russia in an effort to \ncause Applicant to compromise classified information. These relationships create \u201ca \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 \n7. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with \nfamily in Russia and her friend in Israel in regard to the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, and further inquiry \nis necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                              \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies. Applicant has frequent contact with or a close \nrelationship with her sister, who is a citizen and resident of Russia. She also has a close \nrelationship with her father who is visiting Russia for medical treatments. Her relationship \nwith her friend in Israel is less significant because she is not a family member and Israel \nis a close ally of the United States. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant resided in the \nUnited States from 2010 to present, except for relatively brief trips outside the United \nStates. Applicant, her husband, and two children are U.S. citizens. She has one sibling \nand one nephew who live in the United States. She and her husband have assets in the \nUnited States of about $800,000 and no assets in Russia. Applicant\u2019s mother and father \nare permanent residents of the United States. \n      \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by her relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Russia or visiting Russia. Applicant has close relationships with family \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                              \nin that country, and they are at risk from intelligence operatives, criminals, terrorists, and \nhuman rights violations of Russia\u2019s government.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to her friend in Israel are relatively insignificant, \nas Israel is a democracy, complies with the rule of law, and is a close ally of the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s connections to relatives living in Russia are too significant to mitigate \nin the circumstances Applicant presented. Her connections to the United States taken \ntogether are not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns under \nGuideline B relating to her connections to Russia.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline B are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old logistics and procurement specialist. She was born and \nraised to the age of 17 years in Uzbekistan. In 2005, she moved to Russia. She \nobtained Russian citizenship to qualify for social benefits, such as medical services in \nRussia. From 2005 to 2010, she lived in Russia, and in 2010, she immigrated to the \nUnited States. In 2015, she became a U.S. citizen. Applicant said she is willing to \nrenounce her Russian citizenship; however, she has not taken any steps to do so. She \nis currently enrolled in a U.S. university.   \n \nA friend and neighbor, a friend and coworker, a company vice president, and a \nsupervisor provided character evidence on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The general sense of \ntheir evidence is that Applicant is an exceptional employee, professional, honest, \ndiligent, trustworthy, and patriotic. She is a wonderful mother and a loving wife. They \nsupport her access to classified information. She received excellent employee \nevaluations.  \n \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and two children are U.S. citizens, and they reside in the \nUnited States. Applicant\u2019s parents and sister are permanent residents of the United \nStates. She has a nephew who lives in the United States. Applicant and her spouse \nhave substantial assets in the United States and no assets in Russia.  \n \nApplicant has frequent contact with or cares for her family, who are citizens and \nresidents of or visiting Russia. Her frequent contacts with her family in Russia are a \nmanifestation her care and concern for them. Her relationships with residents of Russia \nare positive character traits; however, they raise important foreign influence security \nconcerns. Connections to foreign countries must be balanced against connections to \nthe United States.      \n \nApplicant has resided in the United States from 2010 to present, except for some \nbrief trips outside the United States, including trips to Russia in 2012 and 2016. Her \nfather returned to Russia for medical treatments. Her sister is a citizen and resident of \nRussia, and she is a low-level Russian Government employee. She has a close \nrelationship with her father and sister, and she frequently communicates with them.  \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Russia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical situation \nand suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Russia has a history of \nespionage against the United States and violence from terrorists, and the Russian \ngovernment does not respect the full spectrum of human rights.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                              \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n______________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 56-year-old senior designer, who has been employed by a defense contractor since August 1990. He was granted a confidential-level security clearance in July 1991, and he has held a secret-level clearance since September 1996. His clearance was renewed most recently in August 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 44-45.) Applicant has had several ex-wives and girlfriends. He and his fourth wife remarried in August 2019. (Tr. 79.) Applicant has an adult daughter from his first marriage and two adopted adult children from his second marriage. (GEs 2-3, 15-16, 19.) Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in June 1981 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). He had consumed 12 beers while driving around. He was fined $50 and ordered to attend a DWI school. In August 1982, he was charged with public intoxication after sharing 24 beers with a friend (SOR \u00b6 2.b). He forfeited a $35 bond for being drunk in public. (GEs 6, 20- 21.) In April 1988, Applicant and his first wife divorced after three years of marriage, partially because of his drinking. On May 15, 1988, his ex-wife complained to the police that he had assaulted her (pushed her, struck her across the face, knocked her to the ground, and threatened to kill her). The police noticed scratches on her neck and other signs that she had been assaulted. Two days later, Applicant was arrested and booked into the county jail on a peace ",

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/21/2019 \n______________\nDecision \n______________\n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s psychological conditions have negatively impacted his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. He used marijuana as recently as spring 2019 while holding \na security clearance, and he is currently on probation for felonious unlawful restraint \ncommitted in September 2016 when he was under the influence of alcohol. He raised \ndoubts about his personal conduct by falsely denying any illegal drug involvement on his \nFebruary 2015 security clearance application. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case\n \n \nOn May 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline I (psychological conditions), Guideline J (criminal conduct), \nGuideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse), Guideline G (alcohol consumption), \nand Guideline E (personal conduct). The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to \nfind it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \n\n2 \n \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 30, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nAugust 19, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed to a hearing. On August 28, \n2019, I scheduled a hearing for September 23, 2019, to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n \nAt the hearing, 23 Government exhibits (GEs 1-23) were admitted in evidence. \nApplicant and his spouse testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on October 4, \n2019. \n \nI held the record open for one month after the hearing for post-hearing submissions \nfrom Applicant. Applicant submitted character reference letters from three co-workers, \nwhich were admitted without any objections as Applicant exhibits (AEs) A-C. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the following under one or more of the AGs I (SOR \u00b6 1), J (SOR \u00b6 \n2), H (SOR \u00b6 3), G (SOR \u00b6 4), and E (SOR \u00b6 5): \n \n\uf0b7 A licensed psychologist diagnosed Applicant in May 2018 with bipolar \ndisorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and borderline \npersonality disorder, and opined that Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder and \nborderline personality disorder negatively impact his judgment, reliability, \nstability, and trustworthiness (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 5.a); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was hospitalized as an inpatient for mental health reasons in at \nleast 1989, 1995, 2005, 2014, and 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 5.a); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was charged with the following offenses: driving while intoxicated \n(DWI) in approximately 1981 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 4.a, 5.a); public intoxication in \napproximately 1982 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 4.a, 5.a); peace bond complaint -  murder \nin approximately May 1988 while under the influence of alcohol (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, \n4.a, 5.a); assault in approximately April 1989 while under the influence of \nalcohol (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 4.a, 5.a); malicious damage in approximately May 1989 \nwhile under the influence of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 2.e, 4.a, 5.a); threatening, \nbreach of peace, bigotry, and assault of police officer in approximately \nDecember 1995 (SOR \u00b6 2.f and 5.a); domestic violence and possession of a \nloaded handgun in approximately February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.g and 5.a); \nbreach of peace on April 2, 2014, for which he was sentenced to six months \nin jail, suspended, and two years of probation, which he violated (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h \nand 5.a); violation of the conditions of release on April 12, 2014,  for which \n\n3 \n \nhe was sentenced to one year in jail, suspended, and two years of probation \nwhich was terminated in 2017 for a violation (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.i and 5.a); disorderly \nconduct in approximately May 2014 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.j and 5.a); and felonious \nunlawful restraint in September 2016 while under the influence of alcohol, for \nwhich he was sentenced to  three years in jail, suspended, and three years \nof probation to November 2020 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.k, 4.a, and 5.a);  \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant used marijuana on various occasions between 2005 and \nNovember 2015 while holding a security clearance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 5.a); \ntested positive for marijuana on various occasions, including in November \n2012, January 2014, April 2014, and October 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 5.a); \nand was diagnosed with cannabis abuse or cannabis abuse disorder in \nNovember 2012 and October 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 5.a); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in July 1989 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.b \nand 5.a) and with alcohol use disorder in October 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.c and \n5.a); and \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant deliberately falsified his December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 5.b) and February \n2015 (SOR \u00b6 5.c) security clearance applications by responding negatively to \na question concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years and not \ndisclosing his marijuana use. \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted that he has mental health issues \n(bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and borderline \npersonality disorder), but he denied that his bipolar disorder affects his trustworthiness. He \nadmitted that he has been hospitalized on an inpatient basis five times since 1989 for his \nmental health issues, which \u201crequire tending to on a regular basis and have led to \nhospitalization in the past during trials (including many errors) of a variety of mediations in \nconjunction with other confounding factors.\u201d He admitted the alleged criminal charges with \nthe exception of the May 1988 charge of peace bond complaint \u2013 murder. He had no \nrecord of or recall of the offense. He attributed the criminal charges to his alcoholism, and \nto difficulties finding the proper medication balance for his mental health issues. \n \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana on various occasions between November 2012 \nand November 2015, and testing positive for marijuana on the four occasions alleged. He \ndenied that he used marijuana as early as 2005 or that he had been diagnosed with \ncannabis abuse or cannabis abuse disorder. Applicant admitted that he was diagnosed as \nalcohol dependent in July 1989, but he denied that he had been similarly diagnosed with \nalcohol abuse in October 2015. He asserted that he maintained abstinence from alcohol \nbetween May 14, 1989, and September 11, 2016. Applicant denied that he had falsified his \nsecurity clearance application in December 2005, asserting that he had not used marijuana \nin the seven years preceding that clearance application, but he admitted that he had \nfalsified his February 2015 security clearance application by not disclosing his marijuana \nuse. He attributed his cannabis use to having had serious relationship difficulties, and to \n\n4 \n \nhis prescribed medications proving ineffective. He asserted that he has been prescribed \nmedical marijuana since January 2017. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior designer, who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since August 1990. He was granted a confidential-level security clearance in \nJuly 1991, and he has held a secret-level clearance since September 1996. His clearance \nwas renewed most recently in August 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 44-45.) \n \nApplicant has had several ex-wives and girlfriends. He and his fourth wife remarried \nin August 2019. (Tr. 79.) Applicant has an adult daughter from his first marriage and two \nadopted adult children from his second marriage. (GEs 2-3, 15-16, 19.) \n \nApplicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in June 1981 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). He had consumed 12 beers while driving around. He was fined $50 and ordered to \nattend a DWI school. In August 1982, he was charged with public intoxication after sharing \n24 beers with a friend (SOR \u00b6 2.b). He forfeited a $35 bond for being drunk in public. (GEs \n6, 20- 21.) \n \nIn April 1988, Applicant and his first wife divorced after three years of marriage, \npartially because of his drinking. On May 15, 1988, his ex-wife complained to the police \nthat he had assaulted her (pushed her, struck her across the face, knocked her to the \nground, and threatened to kill her). The police noticed scratches on her neck and other \nsigns that she had been assaulted. Two days later, Applicant was arrested and booked into \nthe county jail on a peace bond complaint of intent to murder his ex-wife (SOR \u00b6 2.c). In \nthe jail, he exhibited signs of polysubstance abuse, and he admitted he had consumed 24 \nbeers before his arrest (SOR \u00b6 4.a). He posted a bond of $2,000 on May 23, 1988, and \nwas released from custody. On June 8, 1988, he pled guilty to assault by contact on his ex-\nwife and was fined $200 plus costs. (GEs 6, 21.) Applicant testified at his hearing that his \nex-wife \u201cbroke into the house.\u201d (Tr. 62.) \n \nIn September 1988, Applicant married his second wife, and one month later, he \nenlisted in the U.S. military. On April 22, 1989, he was arrested for breach of peace and \nthird degree assault after he started a fight with another person at a local motel (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d). Applicant was intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol when he was arrested. (GE \n7.) During a subject interview with a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) special agent in \nMay 1989, Applicant volunteered that he had consumed eight to ten mixed drinks \ncontaining vodka before the incident and that he was fined $35. He also reported an arrest \nin May 1989 for malicious damage (SOR \u00b6 2.e). After consuming a gallon of vodka at a \nconcert, he started an argument and dented the hood of the victim\u2019s vehicle. He was \nrequired to pay $200 in restitution and $43 in court fees. (GE 21.) \n \n\n5 \n \nAt the request of his military command, Applicant was evaluated at his base\u2019s \ncounseling and assistance center on May 22, 1989. He acknowledged responsibility for two \npre-service alcohol-related incidents for which he had a pre-service waiver. He indicated \nthat he had been drinking regularly since age 16, and that his drinking had doubled while in \nthe military. He expressed a desire to abstain from alcohol, and reported drinking more \nthan intended, loss of control, increasing tolerance, and some withdrawal symptoms. The \nscreener opined that Applicant was \u201cpsychologically dependent\u201d on alcohol and that he \nwas likely to continue to abuse alcohol unless he completed Level III inpatient treatment. It \nwas recommended that he attend a minimum of three Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings per week and be placed on a supervised Antabuse program in the interim. \nApplicant satisfactorily completed a 36-hour alcohol and drug education course on June \n23, 1989. On June 29, 1989, he was processed for disqualification from his military \nprogram because of his alcohol problem and was advised that failure to complete the Level \nIII drug and alcohol abuse program would be grounds for his separation from the military. \n(GE 5.) \n \n On his admission to the Level III program in July 1989, Applicant was diagnosed \nwith substance abuse disorder (SOR \u00b6 4.b). He reported a significant increase in tolerance \nsince January 1989. He was admitted to a structured program of group therapy, individual \ncounseling, and education with a strong AA component. He was cautious at first but was \nlater able to identify factors impacting his alcohol use and to initiate actions to address his \nproblem. He was active in developing his aftercare plan, which included meeting with his \ncommand\u2019s drug and alcohol program advisor on a weekly basis for one year; participating \nin a 12-step program; submitting to urinalysis screening at least four times per month for \none year; and attending a formal aftercare group two hours a week for 12 weeks. He was \nreturned to active duty in August 1989 with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (GE 5.) \n \nApplicant and his second wife divorced in early November 1989. (GEs 1-2.) On \nNovember 9, 1989, Applicant was evaluated by a military clinical psychologist because of \nsuicidal ideation. He reported abstinence from alcohol since August 1989 with the help of \nnightly AA meetings, but admitted that he had started thinking about suicide about two \nmonths prior. He exhibited a depressed mood with a constricted affect. He was diagnosed \nwith alcohol dependence (alcoholism) in remission, and avoidant personality traits, but \nfound fit for full duty. He was advised to obtain an AA sponsor and to receive group and \nindividual therapy through the command\u2019s psychiatry department. In December 1989, \nApplicant was dis-enrolled from his weekly aftercare group for failing to show for a \nscheduled session for the second time. (GE 5.) Applicant was discharged from his military \nservice obligation in March 1990. (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant was married to his third wife from June 1992 to October 1995. (GEs 1-2.) \nThere is no evidence that he had any legal or substance abuse problems during that time. \nIn December 1995, Applicant was arrested for threatening, breach of peace, bigotry, and \nassault on a police officer (SOR \u00b6 2.f). (GE 8.) No details are in evidence about the \noffense. \n \n\n6 \n \nApplicant and his fourth wife married in June 1997, but they separated around \nOctober 2000 or 2001 and were divorced in approximately 2006. (GEs 1, 22.) In February \n2005, he was arrested for his own safety following an incident involving a girlfriend. \nApplicant appeared to be suicidal. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital (SOR \u00b6 1.b), \nwhere he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He indicated during a June 2006 interview \nwith an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he spent four days in the \nhospital (GE 22), although he reported to a clinical provider in 2012 that he was in the \nhospitalized for two weeks in 2005. (GE 17.) Applicant was charged with possession of a \nloaded handgun and domestic violence for the incident involving his girlfriend (SOR \u00b6 2.g), \nbut the charges were nolle prossed in March 2005. (GEs 3, 22.) \n \nWhile on a temporary work assignment for his current employer in approximately \nJuly 2005, a co-worker told Applicant that he should try marijuana to relax.  Applicant took \none or two puffs from a marijuana cigarette offered him by the co-worker. From November \n2005 to 2006, Applicant used marijuana with the son of his current spouse. Applicant liked \nthe effect, but did not use any marijuana for the next three years. (GE 22.) \n \nTo renew his security clearance, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) on December 5, 2005. He indicated that he had consulted with a \nmental health professional from February 2005 to June 2005, and that he had been \narrested in February 2005 for possession of a loaded handgun and domestic violence for \nwhich he had to complete violence education classes. He responded negatively to an \ninquiry concerning whether he had illegally used any controlled substance in the last seven \nyears (SOR \u00b6 5.b). (GE 1.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant denied falsifying his SF \n86, stating that he had not used marijuana in the seven years preceding the application. \nAfter it was pointed out to Applicant at his hearing that his reported use of marijuana in July \n2005 predated his December 2005 SF 86, Applicant explained that he \u201cwas thinking it was \nbackwards,\u201d i.e., that his drug use occurred after he completed his SF 86. (Tr. 70.) \n \nFrom 2009 to the spring of 2015, Applicant used marijuana with acquaintances he \nmet while playing disc golf. Between the spring of 2015 and February 2016, he used \nmarijuana with his wife\u2019s son on four occasions. Applicant was usually provided the \nmarijuana that he used, but a few times he contributed money towards its cost. (GE 22.) \n \nIn January 2012, Applicant began taking several psychiatric medications prescribed \nfor him by his primary care physician. On October 19, 2012, Applicant sought treatment \nfrom a behavioral health service, complaining of anxiety and depression. He reported \nsobriety from alcohol for the past 23 years. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and \nreferred for treatment at a psychiatric hospital. (GE 19; Tr. 50-51.)  Applicant was formally \ndischarged from the behavioral health service on January 3, 2013, for failure to attend any \nsessions beyond the initial assessment. (GE 20.) \n \nApplicant began treatment at the psychiatric hospital on November 12, 2012, four \ndays after the death of his sister (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He reported a history of depression with \noutbursts of anger and deterioration of his condition for about a year. He denied any \ndrinking since 1989, but admitted experiencing suicidal ideation daily. Applicant was \n\n7 \n \ntreated for four days in the facility\u2019s partial hospitalization program (PHP) and twelve days \nin its intensive outpatient program (IOP). Random screens were negative for alcohol (he \nreported attending AA) but positive for marijuana (SOR \u00b6 3.b). After acknowledging that he \nneeded to stop seeing his friends who use marijuana, he reported a relapse of marijuana \nuse on December 19, 2012. At his discharge on December 21, 2012, Applicant was \ndiagnosed on Axis I with bipolar I disorder \u2013 severe without psychotic feat \u2013 depressed; \nPTSD; cannabis abuse \u2013 unspecified; ADHD not otherwise specified; and alcohol \ndependence in sustained full remission. He was diagnosed on Axis II with antisocial \npersonality disorder. At discharge, Applicant was assessed at low risk for harm to self or \nothers. Aftercare plans included follow-up with the behavioral health service and \npharmacological management. (GE 17.) There is no evidence that he engaged in aftercare \ntreatment at that time other than medication management by his primary care doctor. \n \nOn January 13, 2014, Applicant sought treatment in a hospital\u2019s emergency \ndepartment for depression and thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to follow up in the \nhospital\u2019s PHP, where he received treatment from January 16, 2014, to March 7, 2014, for \nhis diagnosed bipolar disorder I, PTSD, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). He reported \non admission to the PHP that he had been using marijuana for eight years, although not \nwithin the past ten days. His attendance in the program was sporadic, but he reported no \nuse of marijuana while in the program. On his discharge, he was given a good prognosis \nprovided he followed up with recommended counseling. (GE 15.) \n \nOn March 20, 2014, he began psychotherapy three times a week with a licensed \nclinical social worker (LCSW), who diagnosed him on Axis I with major depressive affective \ndisorder \u2013 recurrent episode, moderate degree; PTSD; and alcohol dependence in \nremission. Applicant told the LCSW he was not using any marijuana and had abstained \nfrom alcohol for the last 25 years. (GE 14.) \n \nApplicant had developed a close relationship with a girlfriend\u2019s grandson. After their \nrelationship ended, his ex-girlfriend threatened to prevent him from seeing her grandson. \nApplicant reacted by attempting suicide, overdosing on his prescription Xanax and his \ninsulin drug on April 1, 2014. (Tr. 52-53.) He was administered Narcan at the emergency \nroom of a local hospital, where he became very agitated, tried to hit emergency room staff \nand hospital security, and threatened to kill one of the security officers. (GEs 3, 10, 13, 22.) \nHe tested positive for benzodiazepine, amphetamines, cannabis, and opiates, and was \nadmitted to the intensive care unit, where he continued to express threats toward his ex-\ngirlfriend. He was diagnosed with multiple drug overdose, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, and \ntransferred on April 3, 2014, to the hospital\u2019s inpatient psychiatric unit on an involuntary \nlegal status (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He had good behavioral control on the unit and explained that he \noverdosed as a test of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s love, i.e., would she obtain medical attention for \nhim. On April 7, 2014, Applicant was discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of \nbipolar disorder \u2013 recurrent, severe, mixed with psychosis, to follow up with his outpatient \ncounseling and medication management. (GE 13.) \n \nWhile Applicant was in the hospital, his ex-girlfriend served him with a restraining \norder. After his discharge, Applicant relapsed on alcohol and marijuana for a couple of \n\n8 \n \ndays because he was depressed. He started texting and leaving voice messages on his ex-\ngirlfriend\u2019s cellular phone and drove by her house. On April 12, 2014, he was arrested for \nviolating the protective order. (GEs 9, 12, 14, 22.) On April 15, 2014, Applicant was treated \nin a hospital emergency room after state police, in responding to a welfare check, found \nApplicant in an agitated and belligerent state. He had called his supervisor and expressed \na threat of suicide. A urine screen was positive for cannabinoids.  Applicant was \ndischarged from the emergency room after declining treatment, but he continued his \noutpatient counseling with the LCSW. (GEs 14-15, 22.) \n \nOn May 2, 2014, Applicant had an argument with his current spouse (then fourth ex-\nwife) over Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend taking \u201chis grandson\u201d from him. Applicant\u2019s spouse told \nthe police Applicant had pulled her hair, but he had not assaulted her. A witness stated that \nApplicant had pinned his spouse to the ground. Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndisorderly conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.j). (GEs 11-12, 22.) On February 10, 2015, the disorderly \nconduct charge was nolle prossed. Applicant pled guilty to violating a condition of his \nrelease for violating the protective order obtained by his ex-girlfriend, and he was \nsentenced to one year in jail (execution suspended), and two years of probation. (GE 12.) \nHe was also required to attend 26 weeks of anger management classes, which he began in \nJune 2015. (GE 18.) \n \n An arrest warrant was issued for Applicant for breach of peace because of his\ncombative and threatening behavior in the hospital emergency room on April 1, 2014 (SOR\n\u00b6 2.h). Applicant turned himself in to the police when he learned of the warrant on May 8,\n2014. He was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail, execution suspended, and\nplaced on probation for two years. (GEs 10-12.) \n \n \n \n \n     \nThe incidents of April and May 2014 occurred despite counseling and medication \nmanagement. (GEs 14, 22.) On July 3, 2014, Applicant entered a PHP where he was \ntreated for bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation. He expressed on admission that he had \nsome auditory hallucinations. His anti-depressant medication was adjusted with positive \neffect, and he was \u201cstepped down\u201d to the hospital\u2019s intensive outpatient program on July \n21, 2014. He was discharged on August 6, 2014, to aftercare counseling with his therapist \nthree times per week, and medication management by his physician. Applicant was \nclinically stable, and his prognosis was assessed as good as he was able to recognize his \ntriggers and his unhealthy behaviors. (GE 15.) \n \nApplicant resumed his psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW on August 8, 2014. \nHis mood remained stable for the most part, although he was tearful over the loss of his \nrelationship with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s grandson. As of November 26, 2014, he was using \nmarijuana occasionally as a sleep aid against the clinical advice of his therapist. (GE 14.) \n \nApplicant reported his recent psychiatric treatment and his psychotherapy with the \nLCSW on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) completed on February \n13, 2015. He also indicated that he was on probation for two years for violating the \nconditions of his release and for breach of peace. He falsely responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he \n\n9 \n \nhad used any illegal drug in the last seven years. He admits that he lied on his SF 86. (GE \n1; Tr. 70.) \n \nAs of March 2015, Applicant was attending psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW \nonce a week. He had demonstrated increased insight and ability to make decisions in his \nbest interest. Inconsistent compliance with his medications and distress over being denied \na promotion at work led to an increase in his depression in July 2015, although his \ncondition improved once he took his medications as prescribed. Applicant married his fifth \nwife in September 2015, but she left him in October 2015. Applicant\u2019s mental health \ndeteriorated after the breakup, and he missed two weeks of work because of his mental \nstate. He presented for a session with his treating LCSW in a decompensated state in late \nOctober 2015. At the LCSW\u2019s recommendation, Applicant was taken by his son to a local \nhospital. (GEs 14, 22.)  \n \nApplicant received treatment the hospital from October 26 \u2013 27, 2015, for diagnosed \nbipolar disorder \u2013 most recent episode depressed; cannabis use disorder \u2013 moderate; and \nalcohol use disorder in full remission. He tested positive for amphetamines and cannabis, \nand admitted that he had used cannabis on 15 out of the last 30 days. He was transferred \nfrom the emergency room to a psychiatric unit, where he was discharged at his request, to \nobtain treatment elsewhere. He was advised to avoid alcohol and illegal drugs. (GEs 16, \n22.) \n \nOn November 4, 2015, Applicant was assessed for treatment by a behavioral health \nservice. He had experienced multiple losses over the previous two years, to include the \nsuicide of a nephew. Applicant reported no current suicidal ideation, and no alcohol use for \nthe past 25 years. He admitted that he had used marijuana on October 21, 2015, but none \notherwise in the last 30 days. Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder \u2013 current or \nmost recent episode depressed, severe; and with PTSD. On November 9, 2015, Applicant \nwas admitted to a PHP five days per week. He was reminded of the risks of using alcohol \nor illegal drugs and the risk of combining alcohol or other substances with his prescription \nmedications. He was an active participant in group therapy, and reported regular \nattendance at AA with no drinking. He was discharged in January 2016, having completed \nthe PHP and an IOP, to follow up with his therapist. (GE 18.) The last available progress \nnote of his treatment with the LCSW is dated February 23, 2016, although that progress \nnote does not reflect that he was discharged. (GE 14.) Applicant recalls having sessions \nwith the LCSW in 2017 and in 2018. (Tr. 55.) Of all his treatments, he considers his \nsessions with the LCSW to have been the most beneficial for him. (Tr. 66.) \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on February 22, 2016. He detailed his involvement with marijuana, \nincluding on four occasions since the spring of 2015. He admitted knowing that using \nmarijuana was not allowed because of his security clearance. His recent drug involvement \nhad been with his current wife\u2019s son, and he contributed funds to pay for the drug two or \nthree times. Applicant added that he would never use marijuana at work. He expressed an \nintention to continue using marijuana on his personal time because it helps him to cope. He \n\n10 \n \nclaimed his co-workers, family, and friends know about his marijuana use and denied it \ncould be a source of blackmail. (GE 22.) \n  \nOn September 11, 2016, Applicant was arrested for felony unlawful restraint in the \nfirst degree following a domestic violence incident involving an ex-girlfriend. (GE 3.) His ex-\ngirlfriend, who wanted to get drunk with him, bought a bottle of whiskey. After getting \u201cvery \nwasted\u201d with her, he tried to choke her during an argument. (GE 4; Tr. 71-72.) The offense \nwas in violation of his probation for the April 2014 protective order violation. On November \n1, 2017, he was sentenced to three years in jail, execution suspended, and placed on \nprobation for three years. (GE 9.) Applicant was also required to attend a six-month \ndomestic violence program, which he completed. (Tr. 72-73.) He testified that his ex-\ngirlfriend indicated that she would write a positive letter to the court to end his probation \nearly in 2019. (Tr. 73.) He presented no record showing that his probation has been \nterminated. \n \nAt the request of the DOD, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical \npsychologist on May 6, 2018. He reported to the psychologist that he had been attending \nanger management classes twice per week since January 2018. He explained that he had \nstopped his psychotherapy with the LCSW at the latter\u2019s request. He claimed without any \ncorroboration that the LCSW told him he was on the cusp of recovery and his coping skills \nwere good, although he then admitted that he got bored with the therapy and had no plans \nto resume it. He was taking medications prescribed by his primary care physician, and he \nexpressed an intention to continue taking them for his mental stability. Applicant described \ncurrent symptoms of low esteem, sadness, attention and concentration issues, and missing \nhis ex-girlfriend\u2019s grandson. He reported a supportive relationship with his fourth ex-wife \n(spouse as of August 2019). He denied any episodes of mania since 2014. When \ndiscussing his past treatments, Applicant generally indicated that they were beneficial. \nRegarding substance abuse, he stated that he had been abstinent from alcohol from May \n1989 to September 2016, when he relapsed for one day. He stated that he was not \ncurrently using any illegal drugs, and while he had used marijuana occasionally to help him \ncalm down from approximately 2005 through 2014, he only used it with friends at parties. \nHe acknowledged knowing that he was not supposed to use marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant also admitted that he was currently on probation after he \nchoked an ex-girlfriend. (GE 4.) \n \nDuring the evaluation, Applicant appeared guarded when discussing clinical issues; \ndemonstrated loss associations; and needed repeated, direct, and specific questions to \ndisclose information that did not portray him in a positive manner. He was not involved in \nany psychotherapy. In the opinion of the psychologist, Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability \nappeared poor, and his insight appeared fair. He diagnosed Applicant with bipolar I \ndisorder \u2013 unspecified, ADHD \u2013 combined presentation; and borderline personality \ndisorder. Applicant did not report any current PTSD symptoms or substance abuse, \nalthough the psychologist opined that Applicant likely met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis \nas well. He found it concerning that Applicant had used marijuana while holding a \nclearance and indicated that he would be very concerned if Applicant resumed drinking. He \nassessed Applicant\u2019s prognosis as guarded and opined that the bipolar I disorder and \n\n11 \n \nborderline personality disorder are conditions that negatively impact Applicant\u2019s reliability, \njudgment, stability, and trustworthiness. If Applicant became noncompliant with his \nmedications, it would have a significant negative impact on his reliability, stability, and \njudgment. The psychologist considered Applicant\u2019s disengagement from his psychotherapy \nto be ill-advised. Applicant\u2019s longtime employment since 1990, his dedication to his job, \nand the fact that Applicant felt much better than in the past, were favorable issues \nwarranting consideration in the opinion of the psychologist. (GE 4.) \n \nApplicant testified that he obtained a medical marijuana card in January 2017. (Tr. \n64.) He denies any use of marijuana since his last use sometime during the spring of 2019. \n(Tr. 67.) He explained that he had used marijuana in the past when he \u201cwas in total \nbreakdown.\u201d (Tr. 63-64, 67-68.) He admitted that he lied on his February 2015 SF 86 form \nby denying that he used any illegal drug in the last seven years. (Tr. 70.) He knew that \nmarijuana use was not allowed while he held a DOD clearance. (Tr. 67.) Applicant does not \ncurrently attend AA. He denies any current consumption of alcohol and any intention to \ndrink in the future. (Tr. 73.) He realizes that drinking any alcohol will not help him because \nhe loses control when he drinks. (Tr. 74.) \n \nApplicant is grateful to the DOD for granting him the privilege of having a clearance, \nwhich has allowed him to continue his work over the years. He does not believe that he has \nworked on any classified projects. Some of his co-workers do not have security clearances. \nApplicant believes he has done his job well. He is passionate about his work and has had \nno trouble focusing on his work. (Tr. 46-49.) He continues to struggle on a daily basis with \ncontrolling his emotions. (Tr. 54.) He is currently prescribed Lamictal (for his bipolar \ndisorder), Adderall, and a new anti-depressant. He does not always take the Adderall \nbecause it impairs his ability to sleep, and he does not think the Lamictal is helping him.  \n(Tr. 56-57.) He sought counseling for anxiety and depression through his EAP in late spring \n2019, and he was referred to a local psychiatric hospital where they wanted to admit him to \nan inpatient substance abuse treatment program. He was using marijuana at that time, \nalthough he denies he was drinking alcohol. He did not pursue treatment because he did \nnot want to take more time away from his work. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant testified that he is \n\u201cholding it together,\u201d and learning to not allow his emotions to get the better of his \njudgment. (Tr. 59-60.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current spouse has known Applicant for over 25 years. She testified that \nhe has stopped drinking; that they have no alcohol in their house; and that they do not go \nto bars or to alcohol stores. She has not seen him with any alcohol since September 2016. \n(Tr. 76-78.) She is aware that he obtained a medical marijuana card in 2017 and that he \nlast used marijuana in the spring of 2019 when \u201che was having an episode.\u201d (Tr. 81-82.) To \nher knowledge, Applicant \u201conly uses it when he has an issue.\u201d She does not know how \nApplicant obtained the marijuana that he used earlier this year. (Tr. 82.) In all the years that \nshe has known him, Applicant has not talked about his work with her. (Tr. 83-84.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from 2004 to August 2015 attests that Applicant \ndemonstrated a high level of proficiency working on very complex products. This former \nsupervisor never witnessed Applicant intoxicated or impaired at their workplace. Applicant \n\n12 \n \nalways put full effort into his duties and cared about his work. The supervisor knows of \u201cno \nprofessional reason\u201d why Applicant should lose his security clearance. (AE A.) \n \nA co-worker of Applicant\u2019s for the last 15 years, who has become a close friend, \nindicated that he understands the concerns, but he trusts Applicant with his life. In his \nexperience, Applicant has been committed to providing a quality product for the U.S. \nmilitary. As a friend, Applicant has been reliable, consistent, and trustworthy. (AE B.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor since 2014 has known Applicant since 2001. They graduated \nfrom apprenticeship school together and worked on the same crew on and off. This \nsupervisor indicated that he has not witnessed or suspected Applicant of coming to work \nunder the influence of any substance. He vouched for Applicant\u2019s integrity as a trusted \nemployee and patriot. Applicant continues to be a \u201cvaluable and necessary asset to [his] \ncrew.\u201d (AE C.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n13 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concerns about psychological conditions are articulated in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative \ninference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on \nthe basis of mental health counseling. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of mental health issues since 1989, when he was evaluated \nby a military clinical psychologist for suicidal ideation. He exhibited a depressed mood, \nalthough he was found fit for duty. In February 2005, he appeared to be suicidal following \nan incident with an ex-girlfriend, and he was psychiatrically hospitalized for four days for \ndiagnosed bipolar disorder. In January 2012, Applicant began taking psychiatric \nmedications prescribed by his primary care physician. In October 2012, Applicant \nvoluntarily sought treatment from a behavioral health service, complaining of anxiety and \ndepression. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and referred for inpatient psychiatric \ntreatment. On admission to a psychiatric hospital\u2019s PHP in November 2012, he reported \nexperiencing suicidal ideation daily. He was treated in the PHP for four days and then 12 \ndays in its IOP for bipolar I disorder \u2013 severe, PTSD, and ADHD. He used marijuana \nagainst medical advice while in the IOP. Applicant continued to take prescribed psychiatric \nmedications by his primary care physician, but did not follow through with aftercare \ncounseling at that time. \n \n \nExperiencing depression and thoughts of suicide, Applicant received treatment in a \nPHP from January 16, 2014, to March 7, 2014, for diagnosed bipolar I disorder, PTSD, and \nADD. At discharge, Applicant began a therapeutic relationship with a LCSW for diagnosed \nmajor depressive affective disorder (recurrent) and PTSD. He attempted suicide by \noverdose on April 1, 2014, and was hospitalized for six days. He used alcohol and \nmarijuana after discharge because he was depressed, and expressed threats against his \n\n14 \n \nex-girlfriend. Following legal incidents involving an ex-girlfriend and current spouse, he \nreturned to the PHP on July 3, 2014, reporting auditory hallucinations. He was discharged \nfrom the facility\u2019s IOP on August 6, 2014, to continue his counseling with the LCSW. He \nbenefitted from his psychotherapy with her, although as of November 2014, he was using \nmarijuana as a sleep aid against the LCSW\u2019s clinical advice. The break up of a short-lived \nfifth marriage led to a decompensation of his mental health in October 2015.  \n \n \nApplicant received treatment in a PHP from November 9, 2015, to January 2016. He \nreportedly continued in therapy with the LCSW to sometime in early 2018. He was no \nlonger seeing the therapist as of his evaluation by a licensed clinical psychologist for the \nDOD in May 2018. The clinical psychologist diagnosed Applicant with bipolar I disorder, \nADHD, and borderline personality disorder, and opined that Applicant\u2019s bipolar I disorder \nand his borderline personality disorder are conditions that negatively impact his reliability, \njudgment, and trustworthiness. He gave Applicant a guarded prognosis, in part because \nApplicant had discontinued the psychotherapy that had proved beneficial. \n \n \nApplicant continues to take medication prescribed by his primary care doctor for his \nmental health conditions. In the spring of 2019, he sought counseling through his EAP, and \nwas referred to a local psychiatric hospital. He declined to follow its recommendation that \nhe enter its substance abuse treatment program, although he was experiencing anxiety \nand depression and using marijuana at the time. He reportedly did not want to miss work. \n \n \nNo negative inferences are raised solely on the basis of mental health treatment. \nHowever, security concerns are raised under Guideline I when the conditions for which a \nperson has had treatment can impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness with regard to \nhandling or safeguarding classified information. Applicant\u2019s mental health issues have \nbeen a factor in several criminal incidents. The evidence establishes four disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 28: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behavior;  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary hospitalization; and \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n \n\n15 \n \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Regarding AG \u00b6 29, Applicant has not \nalways been compliant with treatment advice, as reflected by his marijuana use against his \ntherapist\u2019s advice. He also failed to follow up with aftercare recommendations on occasion. \nApplicant\u2019s May 2018 diagnosed bipolar I disorder and borderline personality disorder are \nconditions that, in the opinion of a duly-qualified licensed clinical psychologist, negatively \nimpact Applicant\u2019s reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness. That assessment is \nborne out by Applicant\u2019s history of struggles to cope with his mental health issues despite \nseveral psychiatric hospitalizations and outpatient programs. Noting that Applicant \nappeared to be adhering to his medication regimen, the clinical psychologist who evaluated \nhim for the DOD indicated that noncompliance with his medications would have a \nsignificant negative impact on his judgment, stability, and reliability. He gave Applicant a \nguarded prognosis, in part because of his \u201cill-advised\u201d decision to disengage from \npsychotherapy. Applicant claimed that the LCSW ended their therapeutic relationship \nbecause he had good coping skills and was \u201con the cusp of recovery,\u201d but when asked to \nexplain, he stated that he got bored with it. Applicant struggled with anxiety and depression \nin the spring of 2019. He sought assistance through his EAP at work and was referred to a \npsychiatric hospital, where he declined a recommendation to enter a substance abuse \ntreatment program. Applicant testified that his currently prescribed Lamictal for his bipolar \ndisorder \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to do anything,\u201d and that he was placed on a new anti-depressant \nin early summer 2019. It is unclear why his medication was changed. \n \n \nApplicant is credited with seeking treatment when he was experiencing an \nexacerbation of his mental health conditions, but his repeated hospitalizations are some \n\n16 \n \nindication of the difficulty managing his mental health issues. He has yet to demonstrate \nthat his mental health issues have a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation. The \npsychological conditions are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concerns about criminal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mental health issues and alcohol abuse have led to adverse involvement \nwith law enforcement on several occasions. Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of criminal conduct \ntriggers the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; and \n \n(d) violation of revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \n \n \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 have some applicability because three \nyears have passed since Applicant\u2019s last offense. They are as follows \n \n(a) so much times has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n \n \nBy all accounts, Applicant has a good employment record during his 29 years with a \ndefense contractor. Applicant\u2019s co-workers who authored character references for him \ninclude his current and former supervisors. They credibly attest to Applicant\u2019s commitment \nto his duties as a senior designer. Despite his mental health struggles and substance \n\n17 \n \nabuse, he managed to perform his duties with quality. Any adverse impact has been with \nregard to missing work during episodes of \u201cbreakdown\u201d or while obtaining treatment. It is \ndifficult to conclude that the criminal conduct is not likely to recur under AG \u00b6 28(a) or that \nhe is fully rehabilitated under AG \u00b6 28(d). He remains on probation until November 2020 for \nunlawful restraint of an ex-girlfriend in September 2016, and concerns persist about his \nmental health and marijuana use. The criminal conduct security concerns are not \nsufficiently mitigated. \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are articulated \nin AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \n \nApplicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance on several occasions \nbetween approximately July 2005 and the spring of 2019. He was diagnosed with cannabis \nabuse in December 2012 and cannabis abuse disorder in late October 2015. He tested \npositive for cannabinoids in several drug screens over the years, and he used marijuana \nagainst clinical advice. Although he had been reminded in November 2015 of the risk of \ncombining substances, including illegal drugs, with his psychiatric medications, Applicant \nexpressed during his February 22, 2016 subject interview that he intended to continue \nusing marijuana on his personal time because it helps him cope with his mental health \nissues. \n \n \nWhen evaluated by the clinical psychologist for the DOD in May 2018, Applicant \ndenied any current marijuana use, although he admitted that he had used marijuana \noccasionally to relieve anxiety from \u201c2005 to 2014\u201d at parties, despite knowing that it was \ncontrary to his security clearance obligations. It is unclear how many times Applicant used \nmarijuana after he obtained a medical marijuana card in January 2017. He admits that he \nused marijuana in spring 2019, and that he had used marijuana in the past when he \u201cwas \nin total breakdown.\u201d At the referral of his EAP, he was evaluated in late spring 2019 at a \npsychiatric hospital and advised to enter its substance abuse treatment program, which he \ndeclined. Applicant\u2019s drug involvement triggers four disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25, \nas follows: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n\n18 \n \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly-qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof substance use disorder; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia,\u201d Applicant admitted contributing funds to purchase some of the marijuana \nhe used on a few occasions. It is not clear how he obtained the marijuana that he used \nafter he obtained a medical marijuana card in January 2017. AG \u00b6 25(c) has some \napplicability in that he had possession of marijuana while using it, but the evidence of \npurchase is limited. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation of drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns, as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility;  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended: and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \n\n19 \n \n \nApplicant continued to use marijuana to as recently as the spring of 2019, despite \nclinical advice to abstain in part because of the risk of combining it with his psychiatric \nmedications. His involvement with marijuana is too recurrent and recent for mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 26(a). Regarding AG \u00b6 26(b), Applicant now denies any intention to use \nmarijuana in the future, and his current spouse testified that, to her knowledge, he has not \nused any marijuana since the spring of 2019. The evidence shows that Applicant \nrepeatedly turned to marijuana as a sleep aid and to alleviate anxiety and depression, \nknowing that it was contrary to his obligations as a clearance holder. As recently as \nFebruary 2016, he reported an intention to continue to use marijuana on his personal time. \nHis use of marijuana since January 2017 was legal in his state, assuming he obtained the \ndrug legally, but state laws permitting medical marijuana do not alter the federal prohibition \nor existing national security guidelines concerning marijuana use. Given his history of \nmarijuana use, a longer period of abstention is required to ensure against recurrence. The \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are not adequately mitigated. \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is articulated in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant has a record of alcohol-related criminal offenses starting in June 1981. His \ndrinking was a factor in his first divorce. His drinking doubled after he enlisted in the U.S. \nmilitary in September 1988. At the request of his command, he was evaluated in May 1989, \nfound to be alcohol dependent, and directed to attend Level III inpatient treatment, which \nhe completed in August 1989. He reportedly was abstinent from alcohol for 25 years before \nrelapsing on alcohol and marijuana in April 2014. He drank for a couple of days because \nhe was depressed over his ex-girlfriend\u2019s decision to prohibit him from seeing her \ngrandson. There is no evidence that he consumed alcohol thereafter until September 2016, \nwhen he \u201cgot very wasted\u201d on vodka with an ex-girlfriend, whom he claims wanted to get \ndrunk with him. He attempted to choke her on that occasion. Applicant\u2019s history of \nmaladaptive use of alcohol triggers the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n\n20 \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accord with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15 of the Directive, Applicant has the burden to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 23 provides for mitigation \nof his maladaptive use of alcohol under the following conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no \nprevious history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nSince completing alcohol rehabilitation treatment for diagnosed alcohol dependence \nin 1989, Applicant has had two short-lived relapses in April 2014 and September 2016. He \notherwise maintained abstinence over the last 30 years, even while struggling with serious \nmental health issues. His diagnosed alcohol use disorder was noted to be in full remission \nwhen he presented for treatment in October 2015. While being treated in a PHP in \nNovember 2015, he reported regular attendance at AA with no drinking. Regarding his \nmore recent mental health and substance abuse issues that led him to consult with the \nEAP and led to a referral to a substance abuse treatment program earlier this year, there is \nno evidence that alcohol was involved. Applicant\u2019s spouse has known Applicant for more \nthan 25 years, remaining friendly after their divorce in approximately 2006. She testified \nthat she has not observed Applicant to drink any alcohol since September 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s use of alcohol to intoxication with an ex-girlfriend on that occasion appears to \nbe an isolated incident of extremely poor judgment rather than an indication of ongoing \nstruggles with alcohol. Applicant is not currently attending AA, but he is well aware of the \ntrouble alcohol has cost him, and he does not intend to consume alcohol in the future. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) have some applicability in this case. Applicant had established a \n\n21 \n \nlengthy pattern of abstinence after his Level III alcohol treatment in 1989, and he has been \nable to abstain since September 2016. Although his serious relapse of September 2016 is \nnot condoned, he is not likely to repeat that behavior. The alcohol consumption security \nconcerns are mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \n  \nThe concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nRegarding the Government\u2019s case under Guideline E because of Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth issues, criminal conduct, drug involvement, and excessive alcohol consumption, the \nAppeal Board has held that security-related conduct can be considered under more than \none guideline, and in an appropriate case, be given independent weight under each. See \nISCR Case No. 11-06672 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012). To the extent that the security concerns \npersist or are mitigated, my findings under the respective guidelines I, J, H, and G generally \napply to the evaluation of his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness under Guideline E. \nThat being said, further comment is warranted in some aspects. \n \n \nConcerning the mental health concerns, no negative inference is drawn about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment from the fact that he has some mental health issues or has been \ntreated on an inpatient basis for his conditions. No one chooses to suffer from mental \nhealth problems, and treatment is viewed favorably. However, Applicant exhibited \nquestionable judgment with regard to coping with his psychological conditions at times, \nincluding not pursuing aftercare counseling in 2013, which could well have led to the \ndeterioration of his mental state exhibited by his suicide attempt and combative behavior in \nthe emergency room in April 2014. Applicant also exhibited extremely poor judgment by \nusing marijuana against clinical advice and knowing that it was contrary to his obligations of \nhis security clearance. He exercised poor judgment in drinking to significant impairment in \nSeptember 2016 just because his ex-girlfriend wanted to get drunk with him. The evidence \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, and with respect to his \nmarijuana use, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, as contemplated within \ndisqualifying conditions \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d), even though neither AG expressly applies \nbecause the conduct is explicitly covered under other guidelines and would be sufficient by \nitself for an adverse determination. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) provide: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \n\n22 \n \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of . . .  \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations . . . . \n \n \nThe evidence falls short of substantiating the SOR allegation (SOR \u00b6 5.b) that \nApplicant deliberately falsified his December 2005 security clearance application by falsely \nresponding \u201cNo\u201d to an inquiry concerning whether he had illegally used any drugs or \ncontrolled substances in the last seven years or since the age of 16. During his February \n22, 2016 interview, Applicant gave a date of July 2005 for his first experience with \nmarijuana. When he answered the SOR, Applicant denied that he falsified his December \n2005 SF 86, explaining that he had not used marijuana. At his hearing, he expressed \nuncertainty about the date of his first use of marijuana and explained that he thought his \nmarijuana use occurred after he completed his SF 86. Applicant could have been mistaken \nin February 2016 about when he first used marijuana. \n \n \nApplicant admits that he lied on his February 2015 SF 86 when he responded \u201cNo\u201d \nto an inquiry concerning whether he had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances \nin the last seven years. The evidence clearly shows that he used marijuana within the \nscope of the inquiry. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. It provides: \n \n(a)  deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use contrary to his obligations as a clearance \nholder could adversely affect his professional standing, if not his defense contractor \nemployment. His concealment of his drug use triggers AG \u00b6 16(e), which provides: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n\n23 \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following mitigating conditions could apply in whole or in part to \nalleviate the concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant disclosed details of his marijuana use during his February 2016 interview. \nThere is no indication that the OPM investigator knew about his drug use and had to \nconfront him about it. Applicant was candid about his marijuana use at his September 2019 \nhearing, volunteering that he had used it as recently as the spring of 2019, and moreover, \nthat he had declined to pursue recommended treatment for substance abuse at that time. \nEven so, his effort to correct the record was not sufficiently prompt for mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 17(a). Regarding AG \u00b6 17(c), the falsification of his SF 86 is not considered minor. It \ncasts doubt on the reliability of his representations and reflects an unacceptable tendency \nto put his self-interest ahead of his obligation to tell the truth. Although his SF 86 \nfalsification appears to have been isolated to that form, it cannot be viewed in isolation \nfrom other personal conduct of significant security concern. Regarding AG \u00b6 17(d), \nApplicant has acknowledged his poor judgment. His efforts to obtain treatment for his \nmental health issues and alcohol problem indicate some rehabilitation. With the exceptions \nnoted under Guideline G, he has maintained abstinence from alcohol for the past 30 years. \nYet, despite some considerable efforts toward alleviating the stressors or factors that led to \nhis inappropriate behaviors, he continues to struggle with his mental health issues, as \nevidenced by his consult with his employer\u2019s EAP in spring 2019. He turned to marijuana to \nalleviate his anxiety and depression, knowing that it was a violation of his security \nclearance requirements. He remains on probation for his September 2016 unlawful \nrestraint of an ex-girlfriend. He lacks persuasive evidence toward establishing that the \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n\n24 \n \n \nAs for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(e) of the vulnerability concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconcealment of his marijuana use, Applicant told the OPM investigator in February 2016 \nthat his co-workers, family, and friends know about his drug involvement. Applicant \npresented three statements from co-workers that are silent on the issue of Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana. It is unclear what they know about Applicant\u2019s substances abuse, including \nwhether they are aware that he used marijuana in 2019. Applicant has only partially \nmitigated concerns of vulnerability by informing the DOD about his drug involvement. The \npersonal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nMy comments under guidelines I, J, H, G, and E are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines \nbut some warrant additional comment. Applicant\u2019s work is clearly very important to him. He \nhas managed to be a productive, valuable employee for several years while dealing with \nserious mental health issues that have been a factor in his substance abuse and criminal \nconduct. Three of Applicant\u2019s co-workers, including his former and present supervisors, \nattest to Applicant\u2019s concern with ensuring quality work for their U.S. military customer. \nThey have not observed him to be impaired on the job. Applicant testified that his work is \nnot classified. Even so, I cannot ignore the security concerns in several adjudicative areas \nthat raise doubts about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. Applicant knew that \nhe is not allowed to use marijuana while holding a security clearance, and the concerns \nraised in that regard are not lessened because he used marijuana when he \u201cwas absolutely \njust losing [his] mind.\u201d \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant would intentionally jeopardize the security of the \nUnited States or his job. Applicant\u2019s longevity with his defense contractor employer is an \nimportant consideration in his favor. However, the Government need not wait until a person \nmishandles or fails to properly safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke \naccess to classified information. Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), \ncert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances \nthat indicate a particular applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of \n\n25 \n \npersons granted access to classified information. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. \n507, 511 n.6 (1980) (noting a high degree of trust must be reposed in federal employee \nwith access to classified information); Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. \nMcElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960) (noting security requirements include \nconsideration of person's honesty, judgment, and sense of obligations), aff'd, 367 U.S. 886 \n(1961). For the reasons discussed above, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility at \nthis time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 5, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 5.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 5.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 5.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on December 31, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 28, \n2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non April 12, 2019, scheduling the hearing for May 10, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. The objection to GE 5 was sustained. Department Counsel amended the \nSOR to delete SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough G, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open for \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant to submit additional information.

With \npenalties and interest, he owed the IRS about $2,450 and his state about $97 for that \ntax year. (Tr. at 19-27, 38-42; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the federal taxes owed for 2014; a vehicle loan that was $675 \npast due with a balance of $15,033; a $2,232 charged-off student loan; eight delinquent \nmedical debts totaling $2,279; and four miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling $1,730. \nExcept as addressed below, the allegations are established through credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2014 federal and state income tax returns on May 8, 2019. He \npaid the IRS $2,450 on June 19, 2019, to resolve his taxes owed for 2014. (Tr. at 19, \n25; AE E, L-N) \n \n \nApplicant is now current on what was a past-due vehicle loan. The balance of the \nloan has been reduced from $15,033 to $11,525. He paid the $100 debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e in December 2018. He paid the $452 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c in May 2019. He \npaid the $77, $71, and $60 medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j in May \n2019. (Tr. at 28-31; GE 2-4: AE B-D, G-J) \n \n \nApplicant stated that he paid the $69 cable television debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nThe debt is reported by a collection company through Experian on the July 2017 \ncombined credit report with a date of last action of June 2017. The debt is listed on a \nNovember 2018 Equifax credit report with a date of last action of August 2014. The debt \nis not listed on the March 2019 Equifax credit report nor the May 2019 Experian credit \nreport. Applicant\u2019s statement that the debt is paid is accepted. (Tr. at 31-32; GE 2-4; AE \nB-D) \n \n \nApplicant has an agreement to pay $200 per month to the company that is \ncollecting the $869 and $768 medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.n. He has an \nagreement to pay $100 per month to the creditor for the $1,109 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. (Tr. at 27, 33) \n \n \nThere are four additional debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant stated that he has \nattempted to contact the creditor for the $2,232 charged-off student loan alleged in SOR \n\n \n3 \n \n\u00b6 1.b, but the creditor has not been cooperative. That debt and the three remaining \nmedical debts totaling $434 are no longer listed on Applicant\u2019s credit report. (Tr. at 28-\n29; GE 2-4; AE B-D, L) \n \n \nApplicant stated that his finances are better since he has a stable job. He just \nreceived a raise, which he will use to address his debts. He has a greater appreciation \nof the importance of financial responsibility. He would like to buy a house within the next \ntwo years, and he knows that maintaining his finances in order is necessary to do so. \nHe has not received formal financial counseling, but he has received advice from his \nbrother and his brother\u2019s wife. He is also scheduled to take a training course from a \nrealtor on what is required to buy a house. He credibly stated that he intends to pay his \ndebts. (Tr. at 19, 27, 29, 43, 49-50; AE L) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nunpaid taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment, but his financial problems were \nprimarily self-inflicted. His failure to file his tax returns and pay his taxes when required \nwas irresponsible and raises some questions about his judgment and willingness to \nabide by rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. However, he has worked at \nhis current job since April 2017, and he has been addressing his financial issues. He \nfiled his 2014 tax returns and paid the taxes owed. He brought his car loan current. He \npaid or is paying all but four of the debts alleged in the SOR. He has a greater \nappreciation of the importance of financial responsibility. He would like to buy a house \nwithin the next two years, and he knows that maintaining his finances in order is \nnecessary to do so. He credibly stated that he intends to pay his debts.  \n \n  \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but a security clearance \nadjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to \nresolve the financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There \nis no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid \nfirst. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to address all his debts. \nThere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved and is under control. I find \nthat he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant action to \nimplement that plan. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 42 years old and was previously employed in a warehousing position from 2010 to 2016. In September 2014, the employees went on strike for approximately six months. In January 2017, she obtained word processing employment with a DOD contractor. She received a certification from a college of business in 1997. She was married in 2006, and she has two daughters, ages 6 and 11. She currently possesses a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 14-19, 35; GE 1) Financial Considerations The SOR alleges that Applicant has 21 delinquent accounts totaling about $24,000. Approximately half of the accounts are for unpaid medical expenses. She admitted that the debts developed over a long period of time, and were initially ignored by her. Her financial problems worsened after Applicant and her husband, who were working for the same employer, went on strike in September 2014. For six months, they each received $150 weekly strike pay to support their family. In March 2015, the union ended the strike, and they resumed their employment with less pay per hour. In 2016, Applicant was laid off after working for her employer for seven weeks. In January 2017, she was offered a position with her current employer. In 2017, she and her husband realized that they needed to take action and resolve their delinquent accounts. (Tr. 20- 30, 33-34) In mid-2017, ",

The \nresulting financial security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n Statement of the Case \n \nOn September 23, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). On December 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation, effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n\n2 \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 17, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. She admitted all 21 SOR allegations, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - \n1.u.), but did not attach any supporting documentation with her response. On June 5,\n2019, the case was assigned to me. On June 6, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 27, 2019.\nThe hearing was held as scheduled.\nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits; Applicant offered no \nexhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 10-13; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-6). I held the record open until July 29, \n2019. On July 11, 2019, DOHA received the hearing transcript. On July 23, 2019, \nApplicant submitted five documents; there were no objections; and I labeled Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A-E, and the documents are admitted into evidence. The record closed on \nJuly 29, 2019. \nFindings of Fact \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact:  Applicant is 42 years old and was \npreviously employed in a warehousing position from 2010 to 2016. In September 2014, \nthe employees went on strike for approximately six months. In January 2017, she \nobtained word processing employment with a DOD contractor. She received a \ncertification from a college of business in 1997. She was married in 2006, and she has \ntwo daughters, ages 6 and 11. She currently possesses a DOD security clearance. (Tr. \n14-19, 35; GE 1)\nFinancial Considerations  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 21 delinquent accounts totaling about \n$24,000. Approximately half of the accounts are for unpaid medical expenses. She \nadmitted that the debts developed over a long period of time, and were initially ignored \nby her. Her financial problems worsened after Applicant and her husband, who were \nworking for the same employer, went on strike in September 2014. For six months, they \neach received $150 weekly strike pay to support their family. In March 2015, the union \nended the strike, and they resumed their employment with less pay per hour. In 2016, \nApplicant was laid off after working for her employer for seven weeks. In January 2017, \nshe was offered a position with her current employer. In 2017, she and her husband \nrealized that they needed to take action and resolve their delinquent accounts. (Tr. 20-\n30, 33-34) \nIn mid-2017, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law offered to let the family stay at his house \nrent-free, He also paid for all of the utilities, and they were responsible for their own \ngroceries. He wanted to help them take control of their growing debt. After Applicant \nand her family moved in with her father-in-law, she began making payments on the \ndelinquent accounts; however, her father-in-law unexpectedly passed away a few \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmonths later. They assumed his mortgage payment and the utilities for the house. (Tr. \n20-30, 33-34) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.g, 1.j, 1.l-1.s, and 1.u, allege unpaid medical accounts totaling \n$13,500. Applicant underwent unexpected surgery in 2016. She had medical insurance, \nbut the remaining balance that was her responsibility was overwhelming. In addition, her \nchildren suffered with medical issues periodically, and the insurance only covered a \nsmall portion of the medical expense. At the time of the hearing, she did not have any \npayment arrangements in place with her medical creditors, but it was her intention to \npay these accounts. The medical debts remain unresolved. (Tr. 39-41) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a student loan account referred for collection with the \nDepartment of Education in the amount of $6,460. In January 2019, Applicant made \narrangements to rehabilitate this account by paying $222 a month for nine months to \ntake the student loans out of default status. The payments are automatically withdrawn \nfrom her bank account, and she has not missed any payments. This account will be in \ngood standing by October 2019. Applicant provided documentation of this account \nwhich showed that as of June 2019, she had reduced the outstanding loan balance to \n$5,195. The student loan debt is being resolved. (Tr. 37-39; AE C) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges an auto loan account charged-off in the amount of $1,607. In \n2017, Applicant was involved in a car accident, and the other driver was at fault. The \naccident totaled her van. The insurance compensation did not cover the full amount of \nher auto loan. At the time of the hearing, Applicant had not yet made arrangements with \nthe creditor to resolve this account. (Tr. 41-42) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.k allege two delinquent credit card accounts with a collection \nagency in the total amount of $839. Applicant is currently in a repayment plan with this \ncreditor, and these accounts will be fully resolved in the near future. After the hearing, \nApplicant timely provided documentation that showed one of the accounts is paid in full. \nThe remaining account is currently being paid. (Tr. 37-38; AE B; SOR response) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, 1.i and 1.t allege delinquent accounts totaling $1,549. At the \ntime of the hearing, Applicant had not yet made arrangements with the creditors to \nresolve these accounts. These debts are unresolved. \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant contacted a consumer credit counseling agency, and \nshe and her spouse received financial counseling. The credit counselor assisted her in \nsetting up a plan to prioritize her debts. Applicant has a monthly budget in place, and \nshe intends to meet with a realtor to discuss selling her father-in-law\u2019s house. Applicant \nhas asserted that once the house is sold, she will use some of the sale proceeds to pay \nher delinquent debts. She is current on her monthly financial obligations and has not \ncreated any new delinquent debt. Last year, Applicant and her spouse made collectively \n$72,000. She provided documentation of her budget, her consumer counseling \nprogram, and a notarized statement from her brother-in-law stating his intent to share all \nproceeds once the house is sold. (Tr. 43-, 52; AE A, AE D, AE E) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \n \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts totaling $24,000, with about half of these \naccounts resulting from unpaid medical services. Applicant\u2019s accumulation of debt \nresulted from underemployment, a prolonged employment strike with minimal income, \nand unexpected health problems. These are circumstances beyond her control. \nApplicant began a student loan rehabilitation program, has significantly reduced the \noutstanding balance, and is very close to having the defaulted loans placed in good \nstanding. She has also paid off and is currently repaying other debts that were referred \nfor collection. She is utilizing information gained from her credit counseling by \nprioritizing her debts. She has established a stable monthly budget, and is making \nsufficient progress with her past-due financial obligations.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant was very candid about her financial issues. Due to the \nunusual circumstances that resulted in the accumulation of delinquent debt, future \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. She has shown good faith efforts in resolving \nher delinquent debts. There are clear indications that her financial problem is being \nresolved, and her finances are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) are \nestablished, and financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant has taken positive steps to correct her outstanding financial obligations. \nShe has made consistent monthly payments to rehabilitate her delinquent student \nloans. She has paid in full a collection account, and is continuing to make monthly \npayments on another collection account. She obtained financial counseling, and is using \nthat knowledge to prioritize her financial obligations. I have carefully applied the law, as \nset forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility.

This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \n\n \n5 \n \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness, but manages to take weekend \nvacations with her family, with her boyfriend, and has a cruise planned.  The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n6 \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. She has a \nhistory of delinquencies. She has not demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant \nperforms well at her job. (AppX D.) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On June 27, 2019, the Defense Office of \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On July 10, 2019, DOHA issued \na Notice of Hearing setting the case for August 15, 2019. The case was heard as \nscheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into \nevidence, and called one witness. Applicant testified, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA through N into evidence.

He has been married since 1993 and has four children. \nHe has earned a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree. He served in the National Guard from \n1981 to 1985, and then was on active duty with the Army until 1992, when he was \nhonorably discharged. While on active duty, he was a master communications instructor. \nIn 2011, he enlisted in the Air Force as inactive reserve. (GE 1; AE A) He has held a Top \nSecret security clearance since December 2008. (Tr. 131; GE 1; AE F) \n \n \nFrom 2007 to 2016, Applicant was employed as a background investigator for \nOPM. Since 2017, he has worked at a military base, providing escort, and management \nservices. In addition, he coaches sports for high school students. (Tr. 129-130; AE A)  \n \n \nIn his June 2016 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he \nwas fired from his position with the OPM in February 2016. He stated the reason for the \ntermination involved inaccuracies in reports of investigation (ROI) that he completed in \n2013. He noted that sources could not recall being interviewed two years later in 2015. \n(GE 1) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nInvestigation of Applicant  \n \n  \nDuring October 2014, a special agent for the OPM interviewed JE, who was a \npersonal-reference source in a background investigation for another individual. During \nthat interview, JE asked the special agent why none of his personal-reference sources \nwere interviewed during his last background investigation that occurred in 2013 while he \nwas stationed overseas. JE also reported to the special agent that he had not been \ninterviewed as a subject during his security clearance investigation, but had received his \nsecurity clearance in December 2013. (AE E at 36-37)  \n \n \nAfter reviewing JE\u2019s investigative file, the special agent learned that Applicant \nhandled JE\u2019s background investigation, and stated in an ROI that he had interviewed JE \non November 1, 2013. The special agent forwarded that information to the IA of the OPM. \nAnother special agent then contacted JE\u2019s personal-reference sources, whom Applicant \nhad reported in an ROI that he had interviewed. During November 2014, the special agent \nre-interviewed one of JE\u2019s personal-reference sources, VK, and inquired about VK\u2019s \nearlier interview with Applicant. VK told the special agent that he was never interviewed \nby Applicant or any other investigator concerning JE, and that he was on temporary duty \naway from the reported location on the date that Applicant\u2019s ROI reported the interview \nhad taken place. (AE D at 20-21) VK also gave information to the special agent that was \ninconsistent with facts recorded in Applicant\u2019s ROI regarding, \u201coccupational title, dates \nand locations of association with [JE], and [VK\u2019s] knowledge of [JE\u2019s] family members.\u201d \n(AE F at 237) \n \n \nUpon receiving the above information, the IA initiated a targeted review of all cases \nApplicant completed between July 2014 and November 2014, while Applicant was \nstateside. (AE D at 21) The targeted review gathered all ROIs submitted by Applicant \nduring that period and assigned investigators to begin contacting individuals named in the \nROIs, who had given statements as subjects, personal-reference sources for subjects, or \nsources for personnel records. (AE D, AE F at 229)  \n \n \nIn an unrelated adverse personnel action imposed during December 2014, \nApplicant was issued a 30-day suspension for reporting inaccurate information on a travel \nvoucher in the amount of $3,184. This disciplinary action was for travel fraud and involved \ninternational travel claims he had submitted from January 2009 through November 2013, \nwhich included the time frame relevant in this case. (AE F at 266) Applicant testified that \nhe was not required to reimburse the Government. (Tr. 181-182)   \n \n \nDuring February 2015, the IA transferred Applicant\u2019s case to the OPM Office of \nInspector General (IG) for potential prosecution. In March 2015, the OPM IG advised the \nIA to address Applicant\u2019s misconduct administratively rather than criminally. According to \na senior advisor for the IG, their office initially misunderstood that this case involved not \nonly the travel voucher case, but also multiple allegations of ROI falsification. (AE F at \n230)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nIn March 2015, Applicant attended an administrative inquiry with the branch chief \nof the IA, to discuss the reported discrepancies between Applicant\u2019s ROIs for JE and VK, \nand their subsequent statements to other investigators. During this interview, Applicant \nclaimed that he had no recollection of the JE case. He denied falsifying his ROIs of either \nJE or VK, or any other investigative reports. He could not explain why his ROI contained \ninformation that was different from the information subsequently obtained by another \ninvestigator. He signed an affidavit denying that he had falsified any of his ROIs. (AE D \nat 23)  \n \n \nLater in March 2015, the IA initiated a recovery process to determine the scope of \npossible falsifications by Applicant. The process included a targeted review of Applicant\u2019s \ncompleted cases from August 2013 to November 2013, while he was overseas, and from \nMay 2014 to November 2014, while he was stateside, as well as pending cases. The \nrecovery process required identification of all sources listed in Applicant\u2019s ROIs during \nthose periods, including subject interviews, personal-reference source interviews, and \nrecord checks. Subsequently, all identified individuals were re-interviewed by other \ninvestigators. (AE D at 221, 224-227) The cost of the recovery process for this re-\ninvestigation was $123,066. (AE F at 265) \n \n \n \nOn September 15, 2015, the branch chief issued his Executive Summary \n(Summary) of the findings of the recovery process and review of Applicant\u2019s cases. It \nrevealed: \n \n \n \nThe number of Applicant\u2019s cases reviewed: 127 \n \n \nThe number of individuals re-interviewed as sources or subjects: 444 \n \n \nThe number of sources with confirmed falsifications: 32 \n \nThe number of sources that presented other falsification indicators \nor testimonies that could not be validated: 147 \n \nWhile testifying about his Summary, the branch chief defined a \u2018confirmed falsification\u2019 in \nthis case as one in which the evidence demonstrated with 100% confidence that a source \nwas not interviewed, did not provide a record, or did not have a specific recollection of a \nmeeting. (Tr. 35-36)  \n \n \nThe Summary states that the above statistics relate to the timeframe when \nApplicant was overseas from August 2013 to November 2013. (AE F at 280-283) No \nadditional instances of falsification were found for the time period from May 2014 to \nNovember 2014. (AE F at 230) \n \n \nOn October 14, 2015, the Department of Justice formally declined prosecution of \nthe case initiated by the IA against Applicant, based on the possible misunderstanding of \nthe scope of the falsifications and the choice of pre-interview self-incrimination warnings \nthat were given to Applicant, which were appropriate for an administrative proceeding \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ninstead of a criminal proceeding. (AE F at 238) Subsequently, Applicant was not \nprosecuted for the falsifications. (Tr. 27) \n    \n \nThe branch chief interviewed Applicant for the second time later in October 2015. \nApplicant was questioned in detail about the 35 cases listed in the Summary. (AE D at \n24-34) Thirty-two sources reported to investigators that they had never been interviewed \nby Applicant; two stated they did not provide Applicant a record as he claimed; and one \nsubject said he was never interviewed by Applicant. Applicant denied all wrongdoing and \nasserted that he interviewed all sources and subjects listed in his ROIs. He could not \nprovide an explanation for the discrepancies in information in his reports and the \ninformation in the investigators\u2019 reports. He did not offer mitigating explanations as to why \nsources would state they were not interviewed. He acknowledged that he could have \nfailed to record the date of an interview in his notes, and then guessed at the correct date \nwhen he drafted the ROI. (GE 3; AE D at 27-35)  \n \n \nApplicant testified at the hearing that, during his second interview, he recalled \ninterviewing JE on October 28, 2013, because of JE\u2019s location. (Tr. 154-156) He \nexplained the reason that this October date was different than the date on his ROI, \nNovember 1, 2013, was because he probably inserted the date he drafted the ROI as the \ndate of the interview. (Tr. 161) He had previously stated in his January 2016 written \nresponse to OPM\u2019s proposed removal of him from employment, that any of his date errors \ncould have occurred because the database software automatically inserted the date the \nreport was drafted as the interview date. (AE F at 246) \n \n \nThe branch chief testified that when Applicant was confronted during his second \ninterview about VK\u2019s statement that he was out of the country on the date Applicant \nreportedly interviewed him, Applicant attributed the date mistake to a typographical error. \n(Tr. 47) The branch chief also stated that, while being interviewed, Applicant \u201ccould only \nprovide limited information about three people, in terms of recollection. The other 32 \nApplicant categorically denied, but couldn\u2019t provide any explanation or mitigating factor.\u201d \n(Tr. 85-86) On November 23, 2015, the branch chief issued his final Report of \nInvestigation regarding the falsification allegations involving Applicant. In it, he \nsummarized the scope of the investigation; his two interviews with Applicant; a list of the \n35 sources re-interviewed; and Applicant\u2019s response to each source\u2019s or subject\u2019s claim \nthat they had not been interviewed. (AE D)   \n \n \nIn February 2016, the area chief for the OPM submitted a memorandum \nrecommending Applicant\u2019s removal from his position as an investigator based on his \nfailure to provide accurate information in 34 ROIs. (AE F at 236) Her report included a \nseparate analysis of the evidence for each of the 31 separate personal-reference sources, \n1 subject, and 2 record providers. She incorporated in each case analysis information \nfrom Applicant\u2019s ROIs; information gathered by investigators during re-interviews; and \nApplicant\u2019s statements in his October 2015 affidavit and interview, and statements in his \nJanuary 2016 written response. Applicant consistently denied allegations of falsification. \nIn each case, the area chief found no explanation or reason why any of the sources or \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nsubjects would assert they had not been interviewed, if they had been interviewed. (AE F \nat 238-265)  \n \n \nAdditional information, provided by the 34 source witnesses who stated that they \nwere not interviewed by Applicant, included: seven personal-reference sources (PC, SD, \nBR, JG, RT, JH, and EL) who said they did not know the subject of the interview; two \npersonal-reference sources (PC and MH) who said they did not know the subject well \nenough to be interviewed; three personal reference sources (TR, MC, and JH) who said \nthey would have remembered if Applicant had interviewed them about another subject \nbecause Applicant had done their background investigations; three personal-reference \nsources (MD, VK, and R J-J) who said they could not have been interviewed on the date \nlisted on the ROI because they were no longer overseas on those dates; and two record \nsources (KS and JC) who said they did not have access to the personnel files of the \nnamed subject, as noted in the ROIs. (AE F at 238-265) \n \n \nJC, a record source for a subject, executed an affidavit on August 18, 2019, in \nwhich he clarified that he did not provide Applicant a hard copy of the subject\u2019s personnel \nfile, but did allow Applicant access to the subject\u2019s electronic personnel file. (AE K) Based \non this affidavit, the branch chief reconsidered the falsification charge involving JC. (Tr. \n100) One personal-reference source, RT, executed an affidavit on August 15, 2019, in \nwhich he stated he was interviewed about subjects JP and JN, but did not recall the \ntimeframes or name of investigator who interviewed him. (AE O)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted an affidavit from JE, executed on August 18, 2019. In it, JE \nstated that his post-traumatic stress disorder could have interfered with his ability to recall \nspeaking or having contact with Applicant between October and November 2013 about \nhis personal background investigation. (AE N)  \n \n \nThe branch chief testified that he reviewed JE\u2019s affidavit and noted that JE did not \ndefinitively state that he had not been interviewed by Applicant. The branch chief pointed \nout nine discrepancies between information reported by Applicant in his ROI and \ninformation reported by the investigator during JE\u2019s re-interview. While some of the facts \nwere minor, the branch chief stated that Applicant\u2019s reported information regarding JE\u2019s \ndivorce and a collection account were vastly different from the investigator\u2019s report. Those \ndifferences appeared to be significant for reporting purposes and added to the accuracy \nof the investigator\u2019s interview. (Tr. 101-102)  \n \n \nIn April 2016, another reviewing Federal agency recommended debarment of \nApplicant, based on the falsifications in his investigative reports which he submitted to \nOPM. (AE F) OPM apparently never issued a final debarment decision. (Tr. 169)  \n   \nApplicant\u2019s Testimony \n \n \nApplicant denied that he submitted ROIs with fabricated information. (Tr. 131) \nFrom fall of 2013 to March of 2015, Applicant estimated that he had conducted over 1,500 \nsource and subject interviews. (Tr. 154) \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nIn his defense, Applicant submitted 12 pages from his schedule book covering the \nweeks of September 1, 2013, to November 4, 2013. The schedule book contains names \nof some interviewees, some locations, and some travel expenses. (AE C) Based on a \nreview of his schedule, Applicant said that he remembered the October 28, 2013 interview \nwith JE because of the listed location of the interview. He then described details of the \nlocation. (Tr. 154-156)  \n \n \nIn response to a question about VK\u2019s assertion that he could not have been \ninterviewed on the date Applicant reported in the ROI because he was out of the country, \nApplicant challenged that statement, claiming that he has an ROI documenting the \ninterview and emphasizing that he conducted the interview. (Tr. 156-157) \n \n  \nApplicant acknowledged that there were discrepancies between the dates on his \ninterview schedule and the dates listed on the ROI regarding when he conducted \ninterviews of JE and VK. Applicant said that he typed the wrong dates on his ROIs. He \npointed out another instance in which he made a similar typographical error in an ROI. \nOn September 5, 2013, he recorded a scheduled source interview with RD, however, the \ndate on the ROI is September 26, 2013, the date he drafted the report. (Tr. 176-177; AE \nC)  \n \n \nWhile testifying, Applicant was questioned about discrepancies between \ninformation in his ROI and information an investigator obtained during the re-interview of \nJG. Applicant reported that JG had daily contact with subject VJ. The investigator reported \nthat JG said he did not know VJ well enough to do a personal-reference source interview. \nApplicant attributed the interview discrepancies to the passage of time between his 2013 \ninterview and the investigator\u2019s 2015 re-interview. He also stated, \u201chow they ask the \nquestion and what questions they ask\u201d could account for reported differences. (Tr. 189; \nAE E at 115-117)  \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant was asked about a discrepancy between information in \nhis ROI of a personal-reference source interview of GL, and information in the re-interview \nreport by the investigator. Applicant stated in his ROI that GL had daily contact with the \nsubject since 2007 at a variety of events. Applicant testified that GL described the subject \nas caring, hardworking, and possessing other positive qualities, as he reported in the ROI. \nGL told the investigator that he was not interviewed by Applicant and did not know the \nsubject. Applicant did not provide a clear explanation for this inconsistency. (Tr. 189-193) \n \n \n  \nApplicant testified that he believed this ROI falsification case was initiated because \nhe filed an EEO complaint against his chain of command in 2013 relating to being \ndisciplined for submitting inaccurate travel vouchers. He believes it was initiated in \nretaliation because he did not have a history of falsification charges prior to this case. (Tr. \n195-197) This defense is not persuasive because the inquiry into the falsifications began \nbefore he was disciplined for travel fraud, and he offered no explanation why more than \n30 named sources or subjects would tell independent investigators that Applicant\u2019s \nreports were false in an effort to jeopardize his employment.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nCharacter References \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife submitted an affidavit on behalf of her husband. She served on \nactive duty in the Air Force for one enlistment and is currently a DoD civilian employee. \nShe holds a security clearance. She attested to Applicant\u2019s diligent work ethic and \nhonesty. (AE J) \n \n \nAn investigator for another Federal agency submitted an affidavit. She asserted \nthat Applicant is dedicated to public service and said that she finds it difficult to believe \nthat he would jeopardize national security. (AE L) \n \n \nA commanding officer in the Navy submitted an affidavit. He has known Applicant \nsince 2012. He worked with Applicant for three months while they were overseas. He \nnever observed Applicant engage in unethical behavior. (AE M)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n\n \n \n \n \n9\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two may potentially apply in this case:  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to establish disqualifying security concerns under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(b) and 16(e)(1). Applicant deliberately provided false and inaccurate information to \nthe Government, which was relevant to a determination of numerous applicants\u2019 national \nsecurity eligibility. Applicant\u2019s personal misconduct creates a vulnerability to exploitation \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \nor duress by other individuals, as it is the type of activity which, if known, could and would \naffect his personal and professional standing. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. They are: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant did not \nmake any effort to disclose or correct the 32 instances of falsified information that he \nsubmitted as part of his background investigations for individuals seeking security \nclearances prior to being confronted with the evidence. He then denied all allegations and \ncontinues to deny that he deliberately falsified background information that he submitted \nto the OPM as part of his employment duties.  \n \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct is not minor, but serious and egregious, in that it compromises procedures \nestablished to safeguard classified and other sensitive information. It occurred numerous \ntimes from August 2013 to November 2013, demonstrating Applicant\u2019s pattern of \ndishonesty, bad judgment, and unreliability.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n\n11\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is an intelligent and educated 55-year-old man, who served in the military \nand worked as a background investigator for the OPM from 2007 to 2016. His wife and \ntwo colleagues attest to his honesty. While testifying, he exhibited knowledge and \nenthusiasm for his job. He was obviously successful in it for several years.  \nAfter reviewing the transcript and the numerous and lengthy exhibits, six significant \nissues dominate my concerns in this case: (1) the scope of the investigation shows 32 \nconfirmed cases of falsification; (2) Applicant\u2019s consistent denial that he has not \nintentionally filed one false or inaccurate ROI; (3) his failure to provide a plausible \nexplanation for the allegations; (4) his lack of remorse for any aspect of his behavior that \ncontributed to the expensive re-investigation of his work product; (5) his previous \ndiscipline for submitting inaccurate travel vouchers; and (6) the potential serious impact \nthat his failure to conduct reliable investigations could have on national security by those \nseeking security clearances who might not have been eligible. The record evidence \nleaves me with serious doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and suitability for a security \nclearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the personal \nconduct guideline.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nHistory of Case \nOn December 12, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons \nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative Guidelines \n(SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 1, 2019, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to another judge on March 27, 2019 and reassigned to me on \nJune 27, 2019. The case was scheduled for hearing on August 27, 2019. At hearing, \nthe Government's case consisted of two exhibits (GEs 1-2). Applicant relied on one \nwitness (himself) and 15 exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 10, \n2019.  \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) told an authorized investigator for the \nDoD during his security interview that he enjoyed marijuana more than drinking alcohol \nand understood that marijuana is federally illegal; (b) used marijuana from February \n2018 to at least May 2014, after filling out his electronic questionnaire for investigations \nprocessing (e-QIP); (c) used marijuana with varying frequency from about October 2007 \nto at least May 2018; (d) purchased marijuana from about October 2007 to at least May \n2018; (e) used hallucinogenic mushrooms approximately three times from about April \n2011 to June 2012; (f) used LSD approximately four times from April 2011 to June \n2012; (g) purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms from about April 2011 to June 2012; (h) \nused ecstasy/molly approximately four times from about October 2011 to June 2012; (I) \npurchased ecstasy/molly approximately four times from about October 2011 to June \n2012; (j) used cocaine approximately five times from August 2011 to February 2012; \nand (k) purchased cocaine approximately two times from about August 2011 to \nFebruary 2012. Allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.k of Guideline H are incorporated \nunder Guideline J. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) falsified material facts in the e-QIP he \nexecuted in August 2016, in response to section 23-illegal use of drugs or drug activity, \nillegal use of drugs or controlled substances by responding \u201cno\u201d to the question \ninquiring about his intended use of drugs or controlled substances in the future; (b) \nabused illegal drugs as detailed under Guideline H; and (c) continues to associate with \nindividuals who use illegal substances. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations pertaining \nto his use and purchase of illegal drugs and association with persons who have used \nand purchased illegal drugs with explanations. He claimed that he ceased using and \npurchasing illegal drugs after June 2012, except for marijuana, which he continued to \nuse until Spring 2014 when he ceased all marijuana use and purchases, except for a \nbrief return to using the substance in February 2018 while he was going through a \ndivorce proceeding. \nApplicant further claimed that he fully intended to cease future use of any illegal \nsubstances when he completed his e-QIP, but made a poor decision to use marijuana \nagain in 2018 due to a difficult divorce. He further claimed that he answered the \nquestion in section 23 of the e-QIP truthfully, honestly, and to the best of his ability, \nnoting that he made the decision in 2014 to stop using marijuana for good.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted \nby Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in August 2016, separated in November 2017, and divorced in \nJuly 2018. (GE 1 and AE I). He has two children from this marriage (ages six and three). \n(GE 1 and AE I) Between August 2009 and May 2012, he attended a state university \nmany miles from his residence in the state. (GE 1) Between August 2012 and August \n2013, he attended other colleges without earning a degree or diploma. After transferring \nto another state university closer to his home in August 2015, he attended classes as a \nfull-time student between August 2013 and May 2016 and earned bachelor\u2019s and \nmaster\u2019s degrees in aeronautical engineering from this university. (GE 1 and AE C) \nThroughout his college career, he has earned excellent grades in his course work while \ncontributing to his local community. (AE E) Applicant reported no military service.   \nSince August 2016, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (GE 1) He \nreported periods of unemployment between August 2015 and August 2016 while a full-\ntime student. (GE 1)  \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nApplicant was introduced to marijuana in high school and smoked the drug \napproximately five to ten times (one to two grams per sitting) with friends in high school \nwith either a joint, hookah, pipe or bong. (GE 2) Applicant\u2019s friends supplied the \nmarijuana freely to Applicant. (GE 2 and Applicant\u2019s response) \nBetween August 2009 and June 2012, Applicant used multiple illegal drugs while \nin college. (GEs 1-2) He smoked marijuana on a weekly to daily basis (3.5 grams every \ntwo days) with friends (3.5 grams at a time). (GEs 1-2) Applicant purchased marijuana \nfrom several of his friends and a neighbor once to twice a week at a cost of $10 a gram \nfor his personal use.

By far, the most \ncommon illegal drug he used during this five-year period was marijuana.  (GEs 1-2) \nContemporaneously with his use of these other drugs, Applicant purchased them \nin various amounts. (GEs 1-2) Except for marijuana, Applicant ceased using and \npurchasing illegal drugs after his withdrawal from college in June 2012. (GEs 1-2; Tr. \n38-39) Altogether, Applicant estimates he used marijuana over 1,000 times while \nenrolled in college (2009-2012). (GE 1) Concerned about his use of illegal drugs, \nApplicant left school in June 2012 and moved home to better focus on his educational \ngoals. (GE 1) And, for over a year (June 2012-August 2013), Applicant abstained from \nall controlled substances. (GEs 1-2) \nIn August 2013, Applicant obtained a legalized medical marijuana license after \ncomplaining of trouble sleeping while maintaining a heavy school and work schedule. \n(GE 2) Between August 2013 and June 2014, he estimates he used marijuana over \n500 times before suspending his use out of concern for his wife and family. (GE 2) To \nmeet his marijuana needs, he purchased the substance from family members and \ncollege friends once or twice a week. (GE 2) He told the investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) who interviewed him in May 2018 that he enjoys \nmarijuana more than drinking alcohol and understands that marijuana activity is illegal \nunder federal law and not allowed while holding a security clearance. (GE 2) While he \nhas continued to associate with some of the individuals who smoked marijuana with him \nand supplied him with marijuana, he has severed ties with others. (GE 2) \nIn August 2013, Applicant obtained a medical marijuana license to buy marijuana \nfor use as a sleeping aid. (GE 2) While holding the license, he purchased marijuana \nfrom a state dispensary and used the substance twice a day to address his stress \nstemming from his son\u2019s health issues and made purchases from his known sources to \nsustain his personal marijuana needs. (GE 2; Tr. 48) Applicant held the license for a \nyear before making the decision in June 2014 to relinquish the license and cease using \nand purchasing marijuana out of concern for the adverse effects the drug was having on \nhis school work and emotional stress from his pending divorce. (GE 2; Tr. 51-52) \nApplicant is credited with abstaining from marijuana and all illegal drugs between June \n2014 and February 2018. \nUpon learning of his state\u2019s full legalization of marijuana in January 2018, \nApplicant (fully aware of his employer\u2019s \u201cno drug\u201d policy) resumed his use of the \nsubstance in February 2018. (GE 2; Tr. 48-51) When asked about his resumed \nmarijuana use and purchase in his OPM interview, he told the investigator that after \nPage 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarijuana became legalized in his state in 2018, he \u201csmoked it once every two weeks \nvia joints\u201d from February 2018 through May 2018 and smoked the substance \u201cby himself \nduring a walk or in a parking lot.\u201d (GE 2) He told the agent that he obtained his \nmarijuana through purchases: one purchase in February 2018 and another in May \n2018. (GE 2) He indicated to the agent that he obtained his marijuana through \npurchases: one purchase in February 2018 and another in May 2018. (GE 2) By \ncontrast, when asked about the extent of his resumed marijuana use between February \nand May 2018 after completing his 2016 e-QIP, he responded with his confirming more \nlimited use: once in February 2018 and another in May 2018, without exhausting his \nFebruary and May purchases. (Tr. 48-51) Applicant\u2019s contrasting estimations are \ndifficult to reconcile without further evidence. \nWhether Applicant could have reconciled his conflicting versions of his marijuana \nuse between February and May 2018 is unknown. For he was never asked to reconcile \nhis competing accounts. Without more clarifying information from Applicant, his earlier \nversion offers the most reliable and credible version. Adverse inferences are warranted, \naccordingly, that his earlier version of resumed use provided the interviewing OPM \nagent is the accepted one. \nSince he quit using marijuana in May 2018, Applicant has submitted to voluntary \ndrug testing and achieved negative test results in a series of non-randomized drug \ntests. (AEs N-P; Tr. 45-46) These reflect encouraging initiatives taken by Applicant. \nHowever, because of his lengthy history, understanding of bans on the use of illegal \ndrugs under federal law, and recency of his resumption of marijuana use and \npurchases, overall favorable inferences covering the likelihood of his returning to illegal \ndrug activity in the foreseeable future cannot be drawn at this time. \nWhile Applicant associated with many of his fraternity brothers who used illegal \ndrugs during his three years of college enrollment in 2009-2012, he ceased association \nwith most of these individuals once he transferred and completed his college education \nat other respected colleges and universities. (GEs 1-2) Except for one of his former \nfraternity brothers from his 2009-2012 college years, Applicant has not associated with \nindividuals who use marijuana and other illegal drugs since 2012. (GE 2) \nE-QiP misstatements \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in August 2016, Applicant provided full and accurate \ndisclosures of his past use and purchase of illegal drugs when answering drug-related \nquestions covered by Section 23 of the e-QIP. And, he made a commitment to abstain \nfrom future drug use in answering no to the question of whether he intended to use \nillegal drugs in the foreseeable future. (GE 1) Two years later in an interview with an \nOPM investigator, he told the investigator that he enjoys marijuana more than drinking \nalcohol; he understands that marijuana use is federally illegal; and he is able to \ncompletely function with marijuana use. (GE 2) However, he stopped short of telling the \ninvestigator that it was his intention to resume his marijuana use when he answered no \nto question 1 of Section 23 of his e-QIP. (GE 2) So, while Applicant facially breached his \nPage 5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstated commitment to abstain from future drug use, when he resumed his marijuana use \nin 2018, what is at issue is whether he misrepresented his future intentions or provided \nwhat he believed at the time to reflect his abstinence intentions when he completed his \ne-QIP. \nConsidering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s coming clean about \nhis past drug involvement in his 2016 e-QIP and unforeseen stressful circumstances \nthat he faced two years later with his pending divorce, Applicant\u2019s assurances of his \ngood-faith intentions of future drug abstinence when he completed his e-QIP are both \nplausible and credible, and, as such, warrant favorable findings. Accordingly, allegations \nof falsification are unsubstantiated. \nEndorsements and awards \nApplicant is well-regarded by his past supervisor who worked with Applicant for \nseveral years before his retirement earlier this year and expressed awareness of \nApplicant\u2019s past use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 21) He characterized Applicant as a very good \nengineer and a \u201cvery outstanding citizen.\u201d (Tr. 20-25) He made an offer of employment \nto Applicant before the latter was  asked to complete an e-QIP. (Tr. 27-28) \nIn preparing Applicant to complete an e-QIP for his security clearance, \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor stressed  the importance of being honest in answering the \nquestions put to him in the questionnaire. (Tr. 22-23) Knowing what he knows now \nabout Applicant\u2019s prior drug activity, he would still hire him. (Tr. 22) His former \nsupervisor affirmed that Applicant was made aware of his company\u2019s \u201cno drug\u201d policy \nshortly after he was offered a position with the company in August 2016. (Tr. 25-27) \nBased on his knowledge of Applicant\u2019s past use of illegal drugs, he considers \nApplicant\u2019s past involvement of illegal drugs to represent \u201can experimental phase of his \nlife, \u201calthough \u201cjust a little bigger experiment.\u201d (Tr. 24-25) \nAsked further about his impressions of Applicant\u2019s character, his former \nsupervisor credited Applicant with understanding the importance of protecting classified \nand sensitive information and offered his professional opinion that Applicant could be \ntrusted to protect classified information and honor his employer\u2019s \u201cno drug policy.\u201d (Tr. \n20, 25) He added that he considered Applicant to be honest and  trustworthy. (Tr. 20-\n22) Applicant is equally praised by his current manager of the engineering team that \nApplicant belongs to. (AE A) His manager, who has had the opportunity to work closely \nwith him since September 2016, credited Applicant with providing exceptional work as \none of his managers high performing employees. (AE A) Because of the excellent work \nhe produces, Applicant has been in demand by other organizations and has received \nspot awards and accelerated promotions. (AEs A-C)  Whether his current manager was \naware of Applicant\u2019s past drug involvement is unclear.  \nColleagues, fellow students, and faculty members who have shared close \nprofessional working relationships with Applicant credited him with being a hardworking \nand superb student and coworker while helping others around him succeed. (AE A) \nOverall they characterized him as honest and trustworthy in all of his interactions with \nPage 6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthem. It is unclear, though, whether any of Applicant\u2019s colleagues, fellow students and \nfaculty advisors were ever made aware of his drug history. \nBetween 2016 and 2017, Applicant has earned excellent performance \nevaluations from his current aerospace engineering employer. (AE H) Between \nDecember 2016 and 2017, he has received spot awards in recognition of his team and \nindividual accomplishments and contributions. (AE D) \nPolicies \nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into account \nfactors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as \nwell as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. \nThe AGs include conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns. They must be considered before deciding whether or not a \nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not \nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of \nthe guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with \nAG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is \nan acceptable security risk. The following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors are pertinent: (1) the nature, \nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication \npolicy factors are pertinent herein: \nPage 7 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDrug Involvement \nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription \ndrug \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability \nand \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations  AG \u00b6 24. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes. . . . AG \u00b6 15. \nCriminal Conduct \nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. AG \u00b6 30. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). As with all \nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a \nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot \ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the \nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a \nsecurity clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nPage 8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be \nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis \nBetween 2007 and 2009, Applicant used and purchased marijuana in varying \nfrequency while in high school. (GE 2) While a student at a state university between \n2009 and June 2012, he expanded his use and purchase of other drugs while continuing \nto use and purchase marijuana in various frequencies. Other illegal drugs used and \npurchased by Applicant during this three year period consisted of hallucinogenic \nmushrooms (three times), LSD (four times); MDMA (four times), and cocaine (five times). \nApplicant continued using and purchasing marijuana for his personal needs after he left \nhis state university in June 2012, but ceased using and purchasing the other drugs he \npursued when enrolled at his initial state university (2009-2012). \nConcerned about the affect his marijuana activity was having on his wife and \nfamily, Applicant ceased using and purchasing marijuana altogether in June 2014. \nExcept for his brief resumption of marijuana use and purchasing over a four-month \nperiod spanning February-May 2018, Applicant, with the help of counseling and concern \nabout his professional career ceased all involvement in the use and purchase of \nmarijuana and pledged to avoid marijuana and other illegal drugs. \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, three disqualifying conditions of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for drug abuse are applicable: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance \nmisuse\u201d; DC 25\u00a9, \u201cillegal possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and 25(g), \n\u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d Judgment concerns \ncontinue to be raised over Applicant\u2019s lengthy pattern of recurrent abuse of illegal drugs. \nTwice in this decade, Applicant abstained from marijuana use and purchases, \nonly to resume his use and purchases in response to changes in his state\u2019s drug laws: \nonce in August 2013 after obtaining a state-approved legalized medical marijuana \nlicense, and again in February 2018 after his state fully legalized the use and purchase \nof marijuana. Once he realized that his continued use of marijuana violated the \u201cno drug\u201d \npolicies of DoD and his employer and placed at risk his obtaining a security clearance, \nhe ceased using marijuana after May 2018 and authored a statement of intent never to \nuse or purchase marijuana or any other illegal drugs with expected revocation of any \nsecurity clearance he should he return to illegal drug usage. Applicant fully understands \nPage 9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat any resumption of drug usage, regardless of how minimal the dosage might violate \nnot only federal law but the anti-drug policies of both the DoD and his company and is \ncommitted to steering clear of all illegal drugs.  \nWhen the Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has been challenged on \nfederalism grounds, the courts have consistently extended federal preemption authority \nover competing state laws that legalize marijuana use. In Oakland Cannabis Buyers, 532 \nU.S. 483 (2001), the Supreme Court did not attempt to invalidate the enabling legislation \nadopted by the particular state in issue. This legislation was designed to implement the \nkey enabling provisions of the state\u2019s Proposition 215, under \u00b6\u00b6 11362.5 et seq. \nProposition 215 (known as the Compassionate Use Act) was passed by this state\u2019s \nvoters in 1996 to validate the right of residents of the state to possess and use marijuana \nfor medical purposes, when they have a recommendation from a licensed physician.  In \nreaffirming federal preemption of the state\u2019s competing law legalizing marijuana use for \nmedicinal purposes, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Court extended its oversight role in \nensuing that federal preemption jurisdiction over illegal drug violators without regard to \nthe state\u2019s marijuana exception. \nIn a more recent related case, the Supreme Court seized  the opportunity to refine \nand clarify the reach of its holding in Oakland Cannabis Buyers, supra. In Raich v. \nGonzales, 545 U.S. 1, 8-14 (2005), the Court addressed the claims of two state residents \nwho suffered from a variety of serious medical conditions and sought to avail themselves \nof medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the state\u2019s Compassionate Use Act. \nNotwithstanding that county investigating officials had found that one respondent\u2019s \nmedical use of marijuana was entirely lawful, federal agents seized and destroyed all six \nof her cannabis plants. \nIn Raich v. Gonzales, supra, the Supreme Court held that the regulation of \nmarijuana under the CSA was fully within Congress\u2019 commerce power (U.S. Const., art. \nI, \u00b6 8), because marijuana production intended for home production could have a \nsubstantial effect on supply and demand in the national market. The Raich Court \nreasoned that federal failure to regulate the intrastate manufacturing and possession of \nmarijuana would leave a considerable gap in the CSA. In turn, the Court vacated the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment. \nSo, even though Applicant complied with his state\u2019s 1996 law including a medical \nmarijuana exception and updated 2018 law that completely legalized marijuana use and \npurchases, neither of his state-approved marijuana permits would have foreclosed the \nFederal Government from prosecuting illegal possession charges under the CSA. \nApplicant appears to understand the reach of the CSA in its preemption of his state\u2019s \nmarijuana legalization and how it reinforces the controlling authority of the DoD\u2019s and his \nemployer\u2019s anti-drug policies that ban marijuana and other legal drugs from the \nworkforces of both DoD and DoD contractors. \nPage 10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTo his credit, Applicant has since committed himself to full compliance with the \nanti-drug policies in force by the DoD and his employer and ceased using and \npurchasing marijuana altogether after May 2018. Based on his mistaken reliance on a \n2018 state law legalizing marijuana to resume his use of marijuana in 2018, he may \nclaim partial benefit of one mitigating condition of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6 \n26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d While Applicant warrants credit for his \nproviding a signed statement of his intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, too little time has passed since his last use and purchase of \nmarijuana in May 2018 to afford him any meaningful benefit of MC \u00b6 26(b). \nAlthough Applicant is committed anew to avoiding illegal drugs in the future and \nindividuals who use them, he has made these commitments before, only to resume his \nuse and purchases of marijuana when both favorable and pressing circumstances arose. \nOver the years, he has enjoyed periods of abstinence (June 2012 through August 2013 \nand June 2014 through January 2018) only to return to recurrent use and purchase of \nmarijuana in February 2018. Whether he can hold the line against recurrent drug \ninvolvement in the foreseeable future remains uncertain based on his past history. \nPersonal conduct concerns: \nBesides incorporating allegations of drug involvement and substance abuse from \nGuideline H, the SOR alleges falsification of Applicant\u2019s 2016 e-QIP by violating the \ncommitment he made in his response to a question posed under section 23 of the e-QIP \nnot to use marijuana or any other controlled substance in the future illegal drugs in the \nfuture. Allegedly, he violated his expressed promise not to use marijuana or other \ncontrolled substances in the future by using marijuana on multiple occasions between \nFebruary 2018 and May 2018. Applicant\u2019s explanations of his expressed intent to avoid \nillegal drugs in the future, being sincere and credible at the time they were made, warrant \ninferences that these allegations are unsubstantiated. \nBecause the drug use allegations covered by Guideline H covered all of the \nmaterial issues concerning Applicant\u2019s past drug use and purchases, no additional \ndiscussion of the disqualifying and mitigating conditions covered by Guideline E are not \nnecessary to complete the analysis of the security significance of Applicant\u2019s historical \nuse and purchase of marijuana and other controlled substances. \nCriminal conduct concerns \nLike the allegations covered by Guideline H, the incorporated allegations of SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 SOR 1.a-1.k are adequately covered by the analysis of the allegations waged under \nGuideline H and do not merit separate discussion under Guideline J. No additional \ndiscussion of the disqualifying and mitigating conditions covered by Guideline J are \nnecessary to complete the analysis of the security significance of Applicant\u2019s historical \nuse and purchase of marijuana and other controlled substances. \nPage 11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has established independent \nprobative evidence of his recurrent use of marijuana under stressful circumstances \nassociated with his pending divorce. He has also established probative evidence of his \nrenewed understanding of the importance of the anti-drug policies of the DoD and his \nemployer that have been in force for all of his years of employment with his current \nemployer. Worth underscoring, too, are Applicant\u2019s important contributions to his \nemployer and DoD. He is credited with bringing strong endorsements from his current \nmanager, former supervisor, academic advisor, colleagues, and former classmates. \nWhile his endorsements are weakened some by the absence of any stated awareness in \nhis furnished written endorsements of knowledge of Applicant\u2019s prior involvement with \nillegal drugs, they are speak well of Applicant\u2019s academic and professional achievements \nand are entitled to considerable weight. \nBenefitting Applicant, too, from a whole person perspective are his documented \nsolid performance evaluations, awards, and education achievements. Taken together, \nthey serve Applicant well in his professional development with his current employer and \nwherever his interests and goals carry him in the future. His education and professional \nprogress to date entitles him to considerable credit in assessing his overall reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to abstain from using drugs proscribed by federal law and the \npolicies of DoD and his employer. \nWithout acknowledgments of awareness of Applicant\u2019s past drug use from those \nwho have provided written endorsements, though, his impressive endorsements, \neducation records and transcripts, performance evaluations, and awards are not enough \nto surmount security concerns over his long and recurrent history of illegal drug abuse. \nWhile he has signaled his willingness to be bound by th ant-drug policies of the DoD and \nhis employer, more time in demonstrated abstinence is needed to facilitate safe \npredictable judgments about his ability to avoid recurrent drug involvement when placed \nin stressful circumstances. \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy history of illegal drug involvement, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns \nrelated to his lengthy and recent history of abuse of illegal drugs. Unfavorable \nconclusions are warranted with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a-\n1.k of Guideline H and incorporated Guidelines E and J. Favorable conclusions are \nwarranted with respect to the allegations of falsification and continued association with \npersons who use illegal substances that are covered by Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nPage 12 \n\n                   \n   \n \nGUIDELINE H (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):         AGAINST APPLICANT \nSub-paras: 1.a-1.k:  \n           Against Applicant \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSub-paras. 2.a and 2.c:    \n        For Applicant \n                          \nSub-para. 2-.b:\n             Against Applicant \n     \n                            \nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):  \n AGAINST APPLICANT \nSub-para. 3.a:    \n        Against  Applicant     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n                                        \n     \n   \nConclusions \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Patrick K. Korody, Esq. \n \n10/04/2019 \nDecision \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations concerns raised by his failure to \ntimely file his 2011, 2012, and 2014 through 2016 Federal tax returns as required. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on October 17, 2017. \nOn February 8, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nThe DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June \n8, 2017.  \n  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on February 21, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nMarch 22, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on April 8, 2019. On June 7, 2019, the \n\n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 27, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called \ntwo witnesses, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through J were admitted without objection. \nI left the record open until July 11, 2019, to enable Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. He timely submitted AX K and AX L, which I have admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old project manager currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since April 2016. He received his associate\u2019s degree in 1984 and his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2011. He and his wife married in 2004 and have two children, one of whom is \nan adult. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance. (GX 1.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal \ntax returns for 2011, 2012, and 2014 through 2016. He admits this allegation and his \nadmission is incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \nBetween 1984 and 2011, Applicant timely filed his tax returns as required. In 2011, \nApplicant experienced several unusual events. He and a partner started a new company. \nThe nature of the business initially required Applicant and his partner to fund the company \nand the day-to-day operations out-of-pocket. Applicant\u2019s partner kept the books for the \ncompany. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s boat was stolen and he was required to create a loss \nstatement to file his taxes. Further, Applicant exercised stock options from a previous \nemployer. (Tr. 34-36.) Finally, Applicant moved from one state to another and rented out \nhis house. (Tr. 51.) All of these issues complicated Applicant\u2019s ability to secure the \nnecessary information and documentation for completing his tax return and he failed to \ntimely file his 2011 tax return in 2012. This failure to file in 2012, combined with increased \ntravel demands and Applicant\u2019s extensive volunteering commitments with his church and \nhis community, snowballed and Applicant failed to timely file his 2012 tax return. He timely \nfiled his 2013 tax return in 2014. (Tr. 53-54; Tr. 64-69.) \n \nApplicant began reconciling his past-due tax returns in 2015, and filed his 2011 tax \nreturn in January 2015. (GX 3; AX D.) However, this effort was short-lived and Applicant \nfailed to timely file his 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax returns. Applicant does not make any \nexcuses for his failure to timely file his tax returns for several years, but he primarily \nattributes his conduct to prioritizing his work, family, and volunteer work over organizing \nhis paperwork. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s tax return preparation was complicated by his \nexpenses and income from his consulting business. (Tr. 71-73; Tr. 80.) \n \nAfter meeting with the investigator during his background investigation, Applicant \nrealized that not only was it his obligation to timely file his tax returns, but that his failure \nto do so could have a negative impact on his ability to be granted a security clearance. \n(Tr. 80.) He filed his 2016 tax return in April 2018 and his 2014 tax return in May 2018. \nHe was entitled to refunds for these two years. Applicant filed his 2015 tax return in \n\n3 \n \nOctober 2018 and completed paying his past-due taxes and penalties on March 5, 2019. \n(GX 3; AX E.) Applicant\u2019s most complex tax return was for 2012, which he filed in January \n2019. He was initially entitled to a refund for 2012, but filed too late to receive it. (GX 3; \nAX L.) Applicant now fully understands that timely filing of his tax returns must be a \npriority. He timely filed his 2017 and 2018 tax returns. (AX E.) Applicant will timely file all \nfuture tax returns. He has significantly reduced his volunteering commitments, in part, to \ncreate more time for focusing on his personal affairs. (Tr. 72.) \n \nApplicant is a committed and valued employee who has received outstanding \nperformance evaluations. (AX A.) His coworker, in recommending Applicant for a security \nclearance, testified that Applicant is a mentor to new employees and is trustworthy, \ndedicated, and honest. (Tr. 24-26.) Applicant\u2019s neighbor of five years and fellow \nneighborhood-board member testified about Applicant\u2019s dedication to the time-consuming \nvolunteer work of serving as a board member, and stated that he has a reputation of being \nhonest and reliable. (Tr. 29-31.) His supervisor of two years highly recommends Applicant \nfor a security clearance and characterizes him as trustworthy and reliable. (AX K.) His \npastor, neighbor, and friend, who are aware of Applicant\u2019s prior tax issues, collectively \nview Applicant as honest, trustworthy, and credible and recommend him for a security \nclearance. (AX B.) Applicant was remorseful, candid, and credible while testifying. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n4 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u2026. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n5 \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, and AG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his tax returns for 2011 through 2016, with the \nexception of 2013, was due to unique circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Specifically, \nApplicant\u2019s preparation of his 2011 tax return was complicated by a number of unusual \nevents. Once his 2011 filing was late, he then failed to timely file for several years. \nApplicant acknowledges that his failure to prioritize preparing and filing his past-due tax \nreturns over his volunteering commitments does not justify his past conduct. However, \nApplicant began his effort to reconcile his past-due returns in 2015 and had filed all his \npast-due returns prior to receiving the SOR in February 2019. Applicant fully paid his past-\ndue taxes for 2015, the only year that he was not entitled to a refund, in March \n2019.  \n \n \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A trustworthiness adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.)  \n \n \nApplicant does not make any excuses for his failure to timely file his tax returns \nand now fully understands the consequences of such conduct. He has established a track \nrecord of timely filing since 2017 and will continue to do so in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(d) and 20(g) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n6 \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \nApplicant prioritized his family and his volunteering commitments in his church and \ncommunity over managing his personal affairs. He is remorseful and now fully recognizes \nthat timely filing his tax returns must be a priority and has made changes in his lifestyle \nto a lot more time for his personal affairs. He is a valued employee and is well respected \nin his community. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his past financial issues. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 63 years old. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1980 and a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 1985. He has been married to his wife since 1982, and they have an adult daughter. From 1989 until May 2016, Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force (USAF), the USAF Reserves, and the Air Force National Guard (AFNG), and he retired as a colonel. He also worked as a federal civil servant, for which he receives a pension. He has worked as a part-time flight instructor for a defense contractor since June 2016. He currently does not hold a security clearance, but previously held a security clearance from the early 1980s until 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12, 18-22) Applicant attributes his financial issues to five work-related moves between 2007 and 2014. During this period, he was geographically separated from his family and supported his wife and daughter in their primary residence. Starting in 2016, a construction project on his vacation home contributed to his financial problems. Additionally, his mother was ill in 2018 and 2019, which contributed to his financial obligations. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2 at 2; AE C; Tr. 23-27, 38) In October 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $70,701 tax lien against Applicant.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/28/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns raised by \nhis tax liens and other delinquent debts. National security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 20, 2017. On \nDecember 21, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on March 6, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge (Answer). Department Counsel sent Applicant an amendment to the SOR on May \n2, 2019, and added two allegations under Guideline F. Applicant responded to the SOR \nAmendment on June 21, 2019. The Government was ready to proceed on June 24, 2019, \nand the case was assigned to me. On June 27, 2019, I issued an order to both parties to \nproduce their evidence by July 22, 2019. On July 8, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for August 6, \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A was admitted without objection. The SOR \nAmendment and Answer were marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. I received the complete \n\n \n2 \n \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 20, 2019. I held the record open until October 8, 2019, to allow \nApplicant to submit additional documentation. On October 6, 2019, Applicant requested \nan extension for the submission of post-hearing documents. Department Counsel \nobjected to an extension, given the length of time the record was held open, and I \nsustained the objection. I marked this email exchange as HE II. Applicant timely submitted \nAE B and C, which were admitted without objection, and the record closed. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 63 years old. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1980 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in business administration in 1985. He has been married to his wife since 1982, \nand they have an adult daughter. From 1989 until May 2016, Applicant served in the U.S. \nAir Force (USAF), the USAF Reserves, and the Air Force National Guard (AFNG), and \nhe retired as a colonel. He also worked as a federal civil servant, for which he receives a \npension. He has worked as a part-time flight instructor for a defense contractor since June \n2016. He currently does not hold a security clearance, but previously held a security \nclearance from the early 1980s until 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12, 18-22) \n \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to five work-related moves between 2007 \nand 2014. During this period, he was geographically separated from his family and \nsupported his wife and daughter in their primary residence. Starting in 2016, a \nconstruction project on his vacation home contributed to his financial problems. \nAdditionally, his mother was ill in 2018 and 2019, which contributed to his financial \nobligations. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2 at 2; AE C; Tr. 23-27, 38)  \n \nIn October 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $70,701 tax lien \nagainst Applicant.  Applicant admitted at the hearing that he learned of the lien in 2017, \nwhen the IRS sent him a letter and garnished his pay. He did not disclose this debt in his \n2017 SCA.  He claimed in his May 2018 personal subject interview that he was unaware \nof the lien due his frequent moves, despite his wife residing in their primary and \npermanent residence. (GE 2 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE 7 at 4; Tr. 22-27, 31, 35-36) \n \nDuring his May 2018 interview, Applicant also told the investigator that he was \nworking with an accountant to resolve his outstanding tax liens, and he had a quarterly \npayment arrangement with the IRS. However, he admitted at the hearing that he had yet \nto meet with an accountant or tax specialist. In late 2018, after the SOR was issued, he \ndid have a couple of phone conversations with a military financial counselor to address \nhis outstanding delinquent debts, but she moved to another base. Despite claims that he \nanticipated that the lien would be resolved within thirty days of his March 2019 Answer to \nthe SOR, he had not consulted with another financial counsel. (GE 7 at 4; Tr. 27-33) \n \nAs of the hearing, Applicant had not yet contacted the IRS regarding the lien, nor \nhad he hired an accountant or tax specialist. He was unsure which tax years were \nincluded in the lien, and he believed the tax lien might be a tax obligation for a property \nhe sold in 2011. He admitted that he should have been more aware of his financial \nobligations and done more to resolve the problems. (GE 2 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE 7 at 4; Tr. \n22-23, 28-36) \n\n \n3 \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he had not yet filed his 2018 federal and \nstate income tax returns, nor had he filed for an extension. Additionally, he filed his income \ntax returns late for at least two additional tax years, but he did not remember which \nspecific years were filed late. Applicant\u2019s May 2019 credit bureau report indicated that a \ncredit card debt and his car loan were 30 to 60 days delinquent. These additional tax \nissues and debts were not alleged in the SOR, and they will not be considered as \ndisqualifying in determining Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. However, these facts can be \nconsidered in determining Applicant\u2019s mitigation, and evaluation under the whole-person \nconcept. (GE 3 at 2, 5; Tr. 34, 36-39) \n \nIn August 2019, a state income tax lien of $14,151 was filed against Applicant for \ntax year 2017. Applicant owns his principle residence, and the mortgage for this property \nis alleged in SOR allegation 1.d. He has also owned a vacation home since 1976. During \nthe summer of 2016, his vacation home was torn down, and Applicant built a new vacation \nhome. In 2017, Applicant withdrew approximately $150,000 from his Thrift Savings Plan \n(TSP) account to fund the construction project at his vacation home. He did not account \nfor the associated tax liability for the early withdrawal, and he did not have the funds to \npay the subsequent state tax liability. (GE 6; AE C; Tr. 42-47)   \n \nApplicant has claimed that in March or April 2019, he established a $2,060 monthly \npayment plan with his state to resolve the lien. At the hearing, he stated that the balance \nwas $6,000, and in his post-hearing submission he claimed that only one payment \nremained for the lien. However, he provided no supporting documentation to demonstrate \npayment or resolution. (GE 6; AE C; Tr. 42-47)   \n \nApplicant opened a revolving credit card account in June 2015, and it became \ndelinquent in July 2018. The $4,000 credit card balance was charged off by the creditor \nat an unknown date. Applicant used the credit card while he and his wife were rebuilding \ntheir vacation home, and it became delinquent due to additional construction expenses \nand elder-related expenses for his mother. Applicant testified that during the spring of \n2019, he established a $500 monthly payment plan. He provided no supporting \ndocumentation to demonstrate payment or resolution. (GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; Tr. 48-49, \n53-54) \n \nThe Amended SOR alleged that Applicant was $16,886 past due on his primary \nhome\u2019s mortgage, and the total outstanding balance was $379,838. Applicant and his \nwife purchased this home in August 2007. Applicant claimed that he fell behind on the \n$3,377 monthly payments in approximately June 2017, due to his military moves between \n2007 and 2014, and the additional expenses associated with living separately from his \nfamily. However, it appears based upon the record evidence that Applicant fell behind on \nhis mortgage payments during the remodel of his vacation home. (GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 3; \nGE 5 at 5; Tr. 49, 52-54) \n \nAfter making three timely payments between May and July 2019, Applicant entered \ninto a loan modification with the mortgage holder, effective August 1, 2019. Applicant\u2019s \nunpaid installments, interest, late charges, fees and costs, and advanced unpaid property \ntaxes and insurance totaled $28,591.48. This balance was rolled into the outstanding \n\n \n4 \n \nprinciple, with the exception of $1,702.18, which was forgiven. The new total outstanding \nbalance is $394,900, and the new monthly payments are almost $3,000. Applicant did not \nprovide proof of payments for this debt. (AE A; Tr. 16, 49-52) \n \nApplicant attributed his failure to timely resolve his tax obligations and other \ndelinquent debts in a timely manner to the pressure of his military positions during his last \nseveral years of service. He recognized that he has avoided resolving his financial issues \nand instead spent too much time doing volunteer work. He does not follow a written \nbudget and has not sought any significant credit counseling. (Tr. 39-40, 56, 59-61) \n \nApplicant\u2019s receives approximately $76,000 annually from his military pension; his \ncivil service pension is $32,000 annually; and he earns approximately $65,000 a year \nfrom his part-time defense-contractor position. Applicant\u2019s wife recently started working \npart-time as a secretary at a local school. He anticipated that this position would last \nbetween one and two months. (AE C; Tr. 11, 20-21, 56) \n \nApplicant volunteers at his church and is actively involved within his community. \nHe received numerous awards and decorations related to his military service, including, \nbut not limited to: Legion of Merit Medal; Meritorious Service Medal with six oak leaf \nclusters; Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters; Air Force Commendation Medal with one \noak leaf cluster; Air Force Achievement Medal; and Air Force Outstanding Unit Award \nwith seven oak leaf clusters. Applicant also served in several command level positions \nduring his 35 years of service in the USAF, USAF Reserves, and AFNG. (AE B; Tr. 59-\n61)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s tax liens and delinquent debts establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant experienced financial issues related to his USAF service, expenses \nassociated with the construction of his vacation home, and the care of his mother. \nAlthough his service and elder costs were conditions beyond his control, his choice to \ntear down his vacation home and rebuild it was within his control. The state tax lien, the \ncharged-off credit card, and the failure to stay current on his primary mortgage were all \n\n \n7 \n \nthe result of choices he made associated with the building project, despite evidence that \nhe had ample resources to pay his financial obligations. \n \nApplicant indicated in his Answer, post-hearing documentation, and at the hearing \nthat he was close to resolving the state lax lien and charged-off credit card and he had \nrehabilitated the mortgage for his primary home. He failed to provide documentation to \nsupport these claims; therefore, the alleged debts remain a current and ongoing issue.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit bureau report indicates he fell behind on two \nadditional debts in the months before his hearing. (GE 3) He has not filed his 2018 state \nand federal income tax returns, nor did he request an extension. These issues \ndemonstrate that there are no clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nresolved; rather, they are current and ongoing. Applicant did not establish that he sought \ncredit counseling in a consistent and meaningful manner. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) was not established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence including his \n35 years of honorable service in the USAF, USAF Reserves, and AFNG. I also considered \nhis extensive service and volunteer efforts at his church and within his community. \n \nI conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns or establish his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the SOR allegations. He is a 26-year-old recent master\u2019s graduate sponsored for a clearance by a U.S. defense contractor since March 2018. He has not previously held a clearance (Item 3). The SOR alleges, and Item 3 establishes ten delinquent debts totaling over $32,000. The debts comprise a $600 delinquent medical bill (SOR 1.a), a $200 delinquent utility bill (SOR 1.b), and eight delinquent education loans totaling over $31,000 (SOR 1.c-1.j).

He is a 26-year-old recent master\u2019s \ngraduate sponsored for a clearance by a U.S. defense contractor since March 2018. He \nhas not previously held a clearance (Item 3). \nThe SOR alleges, and Item 3 establishes ten delinquent debts totaling over \n$32,000. The debts comprise a $600 delinquent medical bill (SOR 1.a), a $200 \ndelinquent utility bill (SOR 1.b), and eight delinquent education loans totaling over \n$31,000 (SOR 1.c-1.j).

However, Item 3 also reflects what appears to be a master account held by the \nSOR creditor, with a $27,000 credit limit/high credit, being transferred to another lender \n4\nas being 120 days past due as of November 2011. In addition, Item three reflects two\naccounts, with account numbers different from both the master account and the SOR \naccounts, held by the servicing agent for the SOR creditor, each with a $10,000 credit \nlimit/high credit and current balances of $8,511 and $12,126, respectively, as of May \n2018. The accounts are reported as current, although having been 90 days past due. \nMoreover, although Item 3 reports the master account and the SOR accounts as \nApplicant\u2019s individual responsibility, the servicing agent accounts are reported as joint \naccounts. \nApplicant disclosed no financial issues on his March 2018 clearance application \n(Item 2). Applicant\u2019s Answer stated, and his Response subsequently documented, that \nApplicant had medical insurance for the SOR 1.a medical debt, and provided the claim \nnumber for his dispute of that debt. Similarly, he stated, and later documented that he \nfirst became aware of the delinquent SOR 1.b utility bill during a July 2018 interview \nwith a Government investigator, and promptly paid the bill on 12 July 2018 (Response). \nFinally, Applicant stated, and subsequently documented, that he attended college \nfull time from September 2011 through May 2015, and upon graduating entered a \nmaster\u2019s program at the same college in September 2015, graduating from that program \nin May 2016. Applicant reported his entry into the master\u2019s program to his educational \nloan creditor, which should have gotten his undergraduate loans deferred until he \nfinished that program. Instead, his loans were defaulted and referred for collection to an \nentirely different creditor than appears on Item 3. Applicant provided an 8 February \n2019 letter from that creditor referencing Applicant\u2019s 13 January 2018 (sic) request to \nrehabilitate his defaulted loans, and establishing a $7.00 monthly payment.

She also stated that \nshe and her husband were required to make payments to the collection agent to \nrehabilitate the loan while resolving the deferment issue. \nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a \nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community \ninvolvement. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, \nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n5Applicant\u2019s Answer stated that his parents first had contact with the collection agent in August 2017 and \nprovided a reference number for their contact with the creditor. \n6See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, but \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s education loans fell into default \nwhen the servicing agent failed to note Applicant\u2019s continued full-time college \nattendance. The proliferation of account holders and account numbers highlights the \ndifficulty in resolving defaulted loans once they fall into default. Nevertheless, the loans \nwere delinquent in significant amounts.7 \nHowever, Applicant meets several of the mitigating conditions for financial \nconsiderations. His failure to maintain his education loan payments is recent, but \ninfrequent, and the circumstances are not likely to recur.8 Moreover, his failure to pay or \nmake pay arrangements was initially due to circumstances beyond his control, and he \nhas utilized the available means to resolve the defaults.9 \nWhile Applicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, he has clearly \nundertaken to rehabilitate the defaulted loans.10 These efforts and his efforts to resolve \nhis delinquent medical and utility bills constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.11 \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s evidence documents that he has a reasonable basis for \nchallenging the credit bureau entries which form the basis of the SOR. 12 The major \nissue is his education loans, and he has done what he can to rehabilitate the loans \npending an opportunity to challenge the correct loan balances. I conclude Guideline F \nfor Applicant.\n Formal Findings \nParagraph 1.

Young, Esquire \n \nOctober 4, 2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant used cocaine three times between 2012 and 2014, while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant has not had any further involvement with illegal drugs, and \nhis life and career show successful mitigation. Based on a review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on May 23, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1.) On December 14, 2018, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nH (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective \nwithin the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on March 15, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on April 30, 2019. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nMay 14, 2019. It was reassigned to me on May 22, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on June 10, 2019. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on July 31, 2019. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 \nand 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits A \nthrough F, which were admitted without objection, and testified on his own behalf. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open to permit him to submit additional \nevidence. On August 19, 2019, he submitted Applicant Exhibit G, which was admitted \nwithout objection and the record closed. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non August 12, 2019. \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old single employee of a defense contractor. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, and two master\u2019s degrees. He is employed as a strategic planner, and \nis seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his \nemployment. He has worked for his employer since 2004 and received a security \nclearance in approximately 2007. (Tr. 14-16; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, \nand 17.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted the single allegation under this \nparagraph. \n \nApplicant used cocaine a total of three times in his life \u2013 once in 2012, once in \n2013, and a final time in 2014. Each use coincided with parties or concerts that Applicant \nwas attending. Applicant never purchased any of the cocaine he used. Applicant admitted \nthat he got \u201ccaught up in the scene,\u201d on the occasions when he used the drug. \u201cI justified \nthat it was okay to do and then regretted it.\u201d During the time he used cocaine Applicant \nhad a security clearance, but was not working on a classified program. (Tr. 25-30.)  \n \nApplicant has not used drugs since 2014, and has no desire to use illegal drugs in \nthe future. Applicant does not associate with anyone who uses illegal drugs. When he \nfound himself in about September 2018 at a party where other people in the group were \nusing drugs, he removed himself from that vicinity. Applicant Exhibit A is a signed \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement is grounds for immediate revocation of national security eligibility. Applicant \ntook a drug test with negative results in April 2019. (Tr. 33-34, 37-38, 40-41; Applicant \nExhibit F.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or \nunreliability. Applicant admitted subparagraph 2.a, which alleged that his drug use \ndescribed under Paragraph 1, above, was cognizable under this guideline as well. \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant submitted evidence showing that he is a highly respected and successful \nperson and employee. He has a demanding job, and does it well. He submitted \nevaluations from 2013 through 2019 showing that he is consistently recognized as a top \nperformer. Applicant\u2019s current manager delegates authority to Applicant because of his \n\u201cresponsible character.\u201d (Tr. 18-21, 49; Applicant Exhibits C, D, E, and G.)  \n \n \nLetters of recommendation were submitted for Applicant from people who know \nhim personally and professionally. Three co-workers, and a friend who has a very \nresponsible job in the financial industry, recommend him for a position of trust, and also \nindicated their understanding of the allegations in the SOR. (Tr. 21-23; Applicant Exhibit \nB.)    \n \n \nPolicies \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an \napplicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions (DCs) and \nmitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in evaluating an applicant=s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG & 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG && 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable \nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. In addition, \nthe administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common sense, as well as \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nknowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, AThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.@ Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides: AAny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.@ \n \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement is set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s very minor cocaine use was in the distant past, ending in 2014, five \nyears ago. Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent, and has freely informed co-\nworkers and friends of this drug use. He has successfully mitigated the security \nsignificance of his drug use. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty or \nunwillingness to comply with rules or regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 and especially \nconsidered the following:   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 apply to the facts of this case: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \n \nHis five years of abstinence, along with Applicant\u2019s conduct and testimony, show \na credible intent not to use cocaine, or any other illegal drugs, in the future. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct since 2014 has been exemplary. He fully appreciates and embraces the \nobligations associated with national security eligibility, and has been forthright in \ndisclosing his previous minor drug experimentation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) apply. \nParagraph 2 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant=s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated his \nminor cocaine use that ended five years ago. He is a law abiding, trustworthy, and \nresponsible person and employee. Any potential for pressure, coercion, or duress has \nbeen eliminated, and such conduct is unlikely to recur. Overall, the record evidence does \nnot create doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

National security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn February 8, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On December 21, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). On January 22, \n2019, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a hearing (Answer). The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on April 5, \n2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 26, 2019, setting the hearing for May 30, \n2019. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into \nevidence. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F into \nevidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. The Government also submitted   \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nHearing Exhibit (HE) 1 a discovery letter sent to Applicant The record closed at the \nconclusion of the hearing. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 10, 2019.  \n  \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel also submitted HE 2, a written request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Iran. Applicant did not object to the request, \nand I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are \nsupported by source documents from official U.S. Government publications attached to \nthe request. (Tr. 16) The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general \nknowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The pertinent facts are set out \nin the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the four allegations contained in the SOR. Her admissions are \nincorporated into these findings. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. She was born in Iran. She earned a bachelor\u2019s and a \nmaster\u2019s degree from an Iranian university. She arrived in the United States in 2001 on a \nstudent visa. In 2009, she finished her doctorate degree at a state university. She \nsupported herself as a graduate assistant. She received permanent U.S. residency status \nin 2011. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2017. (Tr. 20-21, 25, 27)  \n \n \nApplicant met her husband while both were attending the state university. He was \nborn in Iran. They married in 2005. He came to the United States in 2002 on a student \nvisa. He earned a doctorate degree. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2017. (Tr. \n21-26, 30) His immediate family resides in Iran. He does not have any immediate family \nmembers residing in the United States. (Tr. 53)  \n \n \nApplicant and her husband have two children, ages eight and five, who were born \nin the United States. Applicant and her husband purchased a $600,000 home in 2017, \nand have a $480,000 mortgage on the property. They have retirement accounts in the \nUnited States. She has about $60,000 in savings. They have no property or financial \ninterests in Iran. (Tr. 22-25, 31, 40)  \n \n \nApplicant returned to Iran to visit her ill father once in 2008. She visited him two to \nthree times in 2012, before his death. He was not affiliated with the government. She and \nher husband and children have visited both her husband\u2019s and her families four or five \ntimes since 2012, including in 2017. She did not go in 2018, but would like to return to \nvisit her family in Iran in the future. (Tr. 26, 45-48; GE 2) Applicant uses her Iranian \npassport to enter and exit Iran, as it is easier. She said she has never been questioned \nby the Iranian government about her activities in the United States during her trips to Iran. \n(Tr. 41; Answer) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Iran. She is 63 years old. Applicant \ngenerally speaks to her mother every day. She last saw her mother in 2017 when she \nvisited her in Iran. Her mother visited the United States in 2006 and 2010. Applicant does \nnot provide financial support to her mother. Her mother is supported through Applicant\u2019s \ndeceased father\u2019s estate. (Tr. 32-33, 39) Applicant is sponsoring her mother for U.S. \ncitizenship. She said her family members know that she works in research in the United \nStates, but they do not know the name of her employer. However, Applicant recently told \nher mother the name because she needed that information for an interview that is part of \nthe U.S. citizenship process. (Tr. 29)  \n \n \nApplicant has three sisters. All of them are citizens and residents of Iran. The oldest \nsister is 41 years old. She is married and has two children. She and her husband are both \nmedical doctors. Applicant speaks to this sister either every day or at least once a month. \n(Tr. 33-35) The second sister is 29 years old. She and her husband have advanced \ndegrees. Applicant speaks to this sister monthly or every three months. The third sister is \n23 years old and unmarried. She lives with Applicant\u2019s mother. She is pursuing a master\u2019s \ndegree at an Iranian university. Applicant speaks to this sister once or twice a month. (Tr. \n33-38; Answer) Applicant is sponsoring all three sisters and their families for U.S. \ncitizenship and has filed initial immigration applications on their behalf. (Tr. 51) None of \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family lives in the United States. (Tr. 53)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s elderly mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nIran. Neither of them is associated with the Iranian government or military. Her father-in-\nlaw worked as an accountant and taught at a university. Applicant has little contact with \nher in-laws, but does visit them when she is in Iran. She thinks her husband \ncommunicates with them about every two weeks. (Tr. 42-45)  \n \n \nApplicant began working for her employer in 2014. She has an extensive and \nimpressive background in research. (AE B, AE E) Two of her supervisors strongly support \nher request for a security clearance. They attest to her accomplishments, leadership, and \nintegrity. (AE C, AE D) She is active in several professional organizations. (Tr. 24, 28) \n \n \nApplicant said that the United States is her home. She intends to live here with her \nfamily the rest of her life. She is happy in the United States. (Tr. 42) \n \n \nIran \n \n \nThe following facts are based on the source documents in HE 2:  \n \nIran has been designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since 1984. It remains \nthe most prominent state sponsor of terrorism, providing financial aid, advanced weapons \nand tactics, and direction to militant and terrorist groups across the Middle East. It \ncultivates operatives across the globe as a contingency to enable potential terrorist \nattacks.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nIran uses terrorist groups to implement foreign policy goals, provide cover for \nintelligence operations, and create instability in the Middle East. It remains an enduring \nthreat to the U.S. national interests. Iran and its primary terrorism partners pose a \npersistent threat to the United States and its partners worldwide. The U.S. Government \ndoes not have diplomatic ties or consular relations with Iran. The Department of State \nwarns U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran due to the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention. \n \n \nIran continued to leverage cyber espionage, propaganda, and attacks to support \nits security priorities, influence events and foreign perceptions, and counter threats \nincluding against U.S. allies in the region. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nhas identified several countries, including Iran, as posing a significant cyber threat against \nthe United States. The DNI specifically noted that Iran will continue to penetrate U.S. and \nallied networks for espionage and to position itself for potential cyber-attacks. There is \nalso concern that Iran will expand its influence in the region and will develop military \ncapabilities that threaten U.S. forces.  \n \n \nIn 2015, the Visa Waiver Program was amended. Under the amendment, citizens \nof Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States. \nThe exclusion of these countries from waiver eligibility reflects that the presence of an \nindividual in that country increases the likelihood that the individual is a credible threat to \nthe national security of the United States, that a foreign terrorist organization has a \nsignificant presence in the country; or that the country is a safe haven for terrorists. \n \n \nIran has a poor human rights record. There are severe restrictions on civil liberties, \nincluding freedom of assembly, association, speech, religion, and the press. Other \nproblems include abuse of due process combined with the use of capital punishment for \ncrimes that do not meet requirements for due process, as well as cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment and punishment; and disregard for the physical integrity of persons, \nwhom authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully detained, tortured, or killed. There are \nnumerous other human rights problems in Iran.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nIran is hostile toward the United States and engages in extensive anti-western \nterrorism activities that operate openly and contrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, \nApplicant\u2019s close connections and visits to her family and her husband\u2019s family there \ngenerate significant heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a).  \n \nApplicant has ongoing contacts with her mother, three sisters, and parents-in-law, \nwho are citizens and residents of Iran. She visited her family once in 2008, two or three \ntimes in 2012, and five or six times after that through 2017. These relationships create a \nheightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because powerful \ngovernment agencies and terrorist sponsors in Iran seek intelligence and engage in \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nbehaviors that are hostile to the United States\u2019 interests. Applicant\u2019s relationship with \nfamily members creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and her desire to help family members living \nin Iran. The evidence is sufficient to raise disqualifying security concerns under AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband maintains regular contact with his parents in Iran. Applicant \nvisits them when she is in Iran. This creates additional heightened risk. AG \u00b6 7(e) applies.  \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nConsidered in light of the substantial anti-western military, espionage, and \nterrorism threats from Iran, Applicant did not sufficiently demonstrate that it is unlikely she \ncould be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual or government and those of the United States due to her Iranian family ties. \nApplicant has legitimate and appropriately close relationships with family members living \nin Iran, and a strong interest in protecting those people. The potential for conflict of interest \nsituations created by those family circumstances is not sufficiently mitigated. Her ongoing \ncommunication and contact with them are neither casual nor infrequent. Accordingly, she \nfailed to establish the mitigating conditions set out in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c).  \n \nThe evidence fails to establish sufficient mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). A key factor \nin the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the United States.\u201d Applicant has developed some connections to the United States: \nshe arrived in the United States in 2001; she earned a doctorate degree in 2009; her \nhusband and children are U.S. citizens and residents; and she became a citizen in 2017, \nless than two years ago. While these facts are in Applicant\u2019s favor, they do not outweigh \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nher long history and important familial relationships within Iran. There is insufficient \nevidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s U.S. ties are so deep and longstanding that she \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interests, involving her family members in Iran, \nin favor of the U.S. interests. Accordingly, she did not sufficiently mitigate the foreign \ninfluence security concerns under this condition. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B and in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe foreign influence security concerns do not arise from any questionable \nconduct by Applicant, but rather from circumstances that are normal results of her family \nsituation. There is no evidence that she has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States. However, after weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all pertinent facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole-person, including her impressive professional accomplishments in the United \nStates and developing ties here, Applicant did not sufficiently mitigate the substantial \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence. The significant potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress remains unmitigated. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 3, 2016. \nOn December 10, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F and Guideline E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely  answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on March 26, 2019.  Applicant received the FORM on April \n\n2 \n \n29, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM,  and identified as Items 1 \nthrough 6, is admitted without objection. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM.  The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2019. Based on my review of the \ndocumentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the financial or personal \nconduct concerns. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2011. He reported no military service. He has never married.

He  noted that 1.b would be paid off when he receives his tax refund. He \nprovided no explanation for the denial in 1.c. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant provided no explanation for any of the delinquent debts that were \ncharged-off or in collection. He admitted that he was fired in 2012, but provided no frame \nof time for which he was unemployed or how the termination affected his financial status. \n(Item 1)  \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose on his 2016 SCA that he had any delinquent debts. (Item \n2) During his 2018 investigative interview, Applicant responded to a question concerning \nany debts that have been turned over to a collection agency, and stated ,yes, and \ndisclosed the past-due collection account in the amount of $3,871. (1.b) He stated that it \nwas a 2014 credit card that he obtained to make a down payment on a 2013 car. He \nadmitted that he never made any payments on the car.  He stated that he forgot about \nthis debt when answering the security clearance questionnaire. Applicant answered no \nas to any other delinquent bills. He was confronted with the charged-off account in 1.a for \n$23,663. He was in a car accident and it was determined that he was at fault. His \ninsurance did not pay. He received a settlement offer for $11,000 in 2018. He has not \nsettled the account, but plans to do so. He did not list the account in the security clearance \napplication because he felt he should not be responsible for the debt because he believes \nhe was not at fault.  He gave no other information. (Item 3) As to the debt in 1.c for $281, \nhe had no recollection of the account, but he did not dispute it.  \n \n \nApplicant lives with his parents and stated that he is saving to pay his debts. \nHowever, he presented no documentation of any payment plans or receipts for payments. \nHe disputed the one debt in 1.c, but provided no documentation to support the claim. \nFinally, he stated that it is not on his credit report. (Item 3) He added that he would attempt \nto obtain his credit reports. There is no information in the record as to his earnings or \nfinancial counseling. \n\n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under the Personal Conduct Guideline at 2.a. that he falsified \nmaterial facts on his 2016 security clearance application when answering Section 26 in \ntotality, Applicant did not list any delinquent debts, defaults, charged-off accounts or \ncollection accounts. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to each subsection in the Section. Applicant \nadmitted this allegation of falsification in his SOR response. \n \n \nIn his 2018 investigative interview, Applicant acknowledged one of the debts and \nstated that he forgot about it. He gave no valid reason for not listing the other debts that \nwere on his credit reports. Applicant\u2019s three credit reports, including the 2019 report reflect \nthe delinquent accounts. (Items 4-6) \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n\n4 \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n\n5 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, and failure to provide \nany documentation, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant provided no evidence of payment arrangements or receipts for any of \nthe debts. He did not present any information and that he promises to pay and set up \nplans. However, he provided no documentation to confirm his assertions. There is no \ninformation in the record as to his current salary. It is impossible to know if he is financially \nstable. Applicant has furnished insufficient information to meet his burden. There is no \nrecord of financial counseling. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n\n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant admitted to allegation 2.a that he deliberately falsified his security \nclearance application by not disclosing any delinquent debts or colletion \naccounts in response to Section 26. He did note during his 2018 \ninvestigative interview that he forgot to put one collection account on the \napplication. However, when confronted with the others he had no valid \nreason as to why he did not list the other accounts. He knew about these \naccounts becaue he then provided explanations about each of them and \nwhy they were not paid.  He deliberately did not report them. Therefore, AG \n16(a) applies. \n \n17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n\n7 \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \nHere, Applicant intentionally failed to report material information about his debts \non his 2016 security clearance application in Section 26 of his SCA. Applicant\u2019s actions \nreveal untrustworthy or unreliable behavior and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. He has not met his burden to mitigate the personal conduct concern. None \nof the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant has never held a security clearance. He has worked for a number of \nyears as a contractor. He did not respond to the FORM, thus there is no other information \nabout his background.   \n \n \nThe record does not provide sufficient information as to why Applicant accrued his \ndelinquent debts. He was unemployed for a  time in 2012, but it is not known for how long. \nHe wants to pay his debts and promises to set up plans. He has not done anything to \nresolve any of the accounts. He has not received financial counseling. There is no \nevidence of payments or payment plans. There is no information concerning his present \nearnings. \n \n\n8 \n \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his security clearance application in section 26. He \nhas not has mitigated the financial or personal conduct security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

In 2011, a tax lien was filed against his residence. \nApplicant knew that he needed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2009 through 2016, and he did not file them until October 2018 to August 2019. He \ncurrently owes about $71,000 to the IRS (not including interest and penalties), and this \ndebt is not in an established payment plan. He did not prove that he was unable to make \ngreater progress resolving his delinquent tax debt. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.        \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 13, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn February 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial considerations). (HE \n2) On March 22, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3) \nOn April 18, 2019, Department Counsel amended the SOR, and on May 31, 2019, \nApplicant responded to the amended SOR. (HE 4, 5) In the amended SOR, SOR \u00b6 1.f \nwas withdrawn, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g were replaced. (HE 4)   \n \nOn June 3, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On June 27, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to an administrative judge. On July 8, 2019, the case was \ntransferred to me for administrative reasons. On June 10, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing, setting the hearing for September 5, 2019. (HE 1)  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits; Applicant offered nine \nexhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Tr. 14-17; GE 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE I) On September 13, 2019, DOHA received \na transcript of the hearing.  \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. All tax-related amounts are rounded to the \nnearest thousand if over $1,000.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR responses, he partially admitted and partially denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i. (HE 5) He also provided \nextenuating and mitigating information. (HE 6) His admissions are accepted as findings of \nfact. Applicant\u2019s SOR responses and attached documentation are admitted into evidence. \n(Tr. 16)  \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old senior account executive for a defense contractor. (GE \n1; SOR response) His resum\u00e9 provides a detailed description of his professional \naccomplishments over from 1987 to present. (Tr. 18-20; SOR response, Tab C) He has \nnever served in the military. (GE 1) His daughter suffered from a long-term medical \ncondition which required multiple expensive hospitalizations. (Tr. 21-22; SOR response) \nIn 1984, he married. (GE 1) In 2013, he separated from his spouse, and in 2016, he was \ndivorced. (Tr. 22-23, 58, 112; SOR response) Applicant accepted responsibility for all of \nthe debts from their marriage including his mortgage. (Tr. 40; SOR response) His children \nwere born in 1987 and 1992. (Tr. 21; GE 1) He has held a security clearance for many \nyears. There is no evidence of a security violation. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nWhen Applicant completed his April 13, 2017 SCA, he disclosed that he failed to \ntimely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and \n2015. (GE 1) He said he timely filed his 2017 and 2018 tax returns. (Tr. 23, 94) By the time \nhis hearing was held, all required tax returns were filed. (Tr. 24, 35) He promised to timely \nfile his future tax returns. (Tr. 37) \n \nApplicant attributed his failure to timely file his federal income tax returns to \nunemployment, medical expenses, separation from his spouse, excess family spending, \nand divorce. (Tr. 97; GE 1) His spouse spent money frivolously, and this character flaw \ncontributed to their marital problems. (Tr. 97-98) He was unemployed from May to October \n2009, and from March to June 2013. (Tr. 44, 56, 59) In 2009, he was paid for three months \nof the unemployment period, and he received a severance check for about $60,000. (Tr. \n44-45)  \n \nOn his April 13, 2017 SCA, Applicant estimated that he owed $25,000 for tax year \n2009, $25,000 for tax year 2011, and $0 for the other tax years. (GE 1) He also disclosed \nthat his $475,000 mortgage was delinquent, and he was attempting to resolve the debt \nwith a short sale. (GE 1) He was working with an attorney and intended to file his tax \nreturns. (GE 1) He expected that the short sale would change the amount of taxes due. \n(GE 1) He disclosed that he had significant tax problems and a large delinquent mortgage \ndebt. (Tr. 60; GE 1) He carelessly failed to disclose that he had not filed his 2010 federal \ntax return, the magnitude of his federal tax debt, his 2011 federal tax lien, and his failure \nto file state tax returns for tax years 2009 to 2015. (Tr. 60) Nevertheless, his disclosures \nwere sufficient to place security officials on notice of financial considerations security \nconcerns, and I do not conclude that he intended to deceive security officials of the scope \nor magnitude of his financial problems. (Tr. 62-63)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s budget indicates he has a gross monthly salary of $14,129. (Tr. 81, 111; \nGE 2 at 31) He owns stocks and bonds valued at $125,000. (GE 2 at 31) He had a monthly \nremainder of $1,683 available to address his tax debt. (GE 2 at 31) He worked with \nattorneys and an accountant on his tax issues. (Tr. 98-99)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2009 through 2013 as required. SOR \u00b6 1.b, as amended, alleges Applicant failed \nto timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016 as required. \nApplicant\u2019s March 2018 Office of Personnel Management personal subject interview (OPM \nPSI) indicates Applicant did not file or pay his federal income taxes from 2009 to present. \n(GE 2 at 44) He said the reason for not filing the tax returns was marital stress and \nunemployment. (GE 2 at 44) The dates of his federal income tax filings are depicted in the \ntables below. He acknowledged that the IRS may dispute some of the tax returns he filed, \nand he may have to refile some tax returns. (Tr. 80)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant in February 2011 \nfor $106,000. According to LexisNexis, the federal tax lien for $106,000 was filed in \nFebruary 2011 in a county court. (GE 4) The LexisNexis document does not show the tax \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nyears that were the basis of the lien. (GE 4) The lien is also indicated on his 2017 credit \nreport. (GE 5 at 2-3) Applicant said he may not have learned about the lien in 2011 \nbecause he was not opening the letters he received from the IRS because his entire \nfinancial life was a \u201cdisaster\u201d at that time. (Tr. 89) Applicant\u2019s March 2018 OPM PSI \nindicates the source of the $106,000 tax lien may be unpaid taxes for tax years 2006 and \n2007. (Tr. 46-48, 52-53; GE 2 at 48) He was unable to locate documents showing he filed \nhis 2006 and 2007 tax returns. (Tr. 31-32, 49-51) He was unsure about the tax years \nrepresented in the 2011 tax lien. (Tr. 100) In August 2019, the IRS issued a Certificate of \nDischarge of Property from Federal Tax Lien. (AE I) The IRS discharge states: \n \nThe United States\u2019 interest in the above described property under the \nreferenced lien is now valueless. Therefore, under Section 6325(b)(2)(B) of \nthe Internal Revenue Code, the Internal Revenue Service discharges the \nabove described property from the lien. However, the lien remains in effect \nfor all other property, or rights to property, to which the lien is attached.  \n \n(AE I) On April 25, 2019, an IRS representative wrote Applicant and advised him that he \nwould issue the Certificate of Discharge once it was established that Applicant had been \ndivested of all rights in the property. (SOR response) Applicant said his accountant told \nhim that the lien was discharged because the IRS was pleased about Applicant\u2019s progress \nresolving his tax issues. (Tr. 32-33) Applicant made a $30,000 payment to the IRS in \nOctober 2017. (Tr. 53, 64)  \n \nThe IRS generally has 10 years to collect a debt. After that time has passed, the \nIRS can no longer legally enforce collection of the debt. The 10-year period is measured \nfrom the date that the tax was assessed, not when it was originally due. The 10-year clock \ndoes not start running until the tax return is filed. If the IRS files a tax return then the \nstatute of limitations began running whenever that assessment was processed by the \nIRS. Before the statute of limitations is applied, tolling must also be assessed. Applicant \nhas not established that the statute of limitations applies to the $106,000 tax debt, which \nis the source of the 2011 tax lien. The lien on Applicant\u2019s residence is resolved otherwise \nhe would not have been able to transfer it back to the mortgage holder. See SOR \u00b6 1.j, \ninfra.  However, based on the IRS\u2019 statement on the lien certificate itself, Applicant has \nnot proven that the underlying tax debt is resolved. (Tr. 72-73, 100, 107-111) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, as amended, alleges Applicant is indebted to the federal government \nfor $40,000 for tax year 2015. The IRS assessed a $40,000 debt when the IRS generated \na substitute tax return. When Applicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year \n2015, he paid the tax of less than $500. The IRS lost his tax return but cashed the check \nhe sent in with his tax return. (Tr. 104) He refiled his tax return for tax year 2015. (Tr. 104) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is mitigated. SOR \u00b6 1.e, as amended, alleges Applicant is indebted to the \nfederal government for $47,000 for tax year 2016. When Applicant filed his federal income \ntax return for tax year 2016, he concluded he owed $32,000 for that tax year. SOR \u00b6 1.e \nis not resolved. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nThe IRS represented in March 25, 2019 tax transcripts that Applicant owed the \nfollowing federal income tax debts based on the IRS\u2019 generation of a substitute tax return: \n \nTax \nYear \nDate of Tax Return \n(month & year) \nAdjusted Gross \nIncome  \n(to nearest $1,000) \nIRS Claim of \nTaxes Owed \n(to nearest $1,000) \nExhibit \n2010 \nSept. 2012 \n$259,000 \n$28,000 \nGE 3 at 1 \n2011 \nOct. 2013 \n$454,000 \n$60,000 \nGE 3 at 2 \n2012 \nNov. 2014 \n$222,000 \n$13,000 \nGE 3 at 3 \n2013 \nSept. 2017 \n$247,000 \n$43,000 \nGE 3 at 4 \n2014 \nSept. 2017 \n$0 \n$0 \nGE 3 at 5 \n2015 \nAug. 2017 \n$189,000 \n$37,000 \nGE 3 at 6 \n2016 \nDec. 2018 \n$365,000 \n$45,000 \nGE 3 at 7 \n2017 \nOct. 2018 (filed by \nApplicant) \n$364,000  \n$0 \nGE 3 at 8 \nTotal \n \n \n$226,000 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, as amended, alleges Applicant failed to timely file his state B income \ntax returns for tax years 2009 through 2013 as required.

On December 4, 2018, Applicant paid the state tax debt, and it is resolved. \n(SOR response, Tab J) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges Applicant has a mortgage account past due in the amount of \n$107,000 with a total loan balance of $474,000. In 2013, Applicant and his spouse \nseparated. (Tr. 55) Applicant and his spouse were unemployed. (Tr. 28) In 2005, \nApplicant purchased a residence for $635,000. (Tr. 81) His primary mortgage was for \n$500,000, and his secondary mortgage was for $125,000. (Tr. 82) In May 2013, Applicant \nmoved out of his residence, and in December 2013, Applicant stopped paying his \nmortgage. (Tr. 56-57, 112) His spouse was unemployed outside her home. (Tr. 112) He \npaid spousal support of about $5,000 monthly, and he expected her to pay the mortgage \nout of her $5,000 monthly payment. (Tr. 112-113) In early 2015, she moved out, and the \nresidence was unoccupied for the next four years. (Tr. 113) Applicant attempted to obtain \na short sale; however, he was unsuccessful either because the mortgage company was \nunwilling to accept the resolution or the IRS was unwilling to release the lien without \npayment, or both. (Tr. 114-118) Applicant also attempted to renegotiate the mortgage \npayment through a mortgage modification. (Tr. 28-29) Applicant sued the mortgage \ncompany alleging the mortgage company violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act when the \nmortgage company reported the foreclosure to credit reporting companies. (Tr. 29, 113-\n114) The mortgage company paid the real estate taxes on the property from December \n2013 to July 2019. (Tr. 115) In July 2019, the mortgage account holder agreed to accept \na deed in lieu of foreclosure. (Tr. 29, 85; AE E; AE F) The mortgage holder paid $5,000 \ntowards Applicant\u2019s attorney fees in settlement of the dispute. (Tr. 29; AE G) In July 2019, \nthe mortgage debt was resolved. (Tr. 29-30, 106) \n \nIn sum, Applicant filed and paid all of his state income taxes. (Tr. 105-106) He \nestimates his federal tax debt is $71,000 after filing his tax returns, not including penalties \nand interest. (Tr. 24-26, 76, 91-92) Applicant believes the IRS will waive the penalties. \n(Tr. 91) He was unable to afford the payment plan the IRS suggested because they \nassumed he owed $200,000 or $300,000, as indicated on the table on page 5, and the \nIRS wanted an initial payment of $100,000. (Tr. 104-105) Based on his accountant\u2019s \nrecommendation, he decided to wait for the IRS to assess his new tax debt after he filed \nhis tax returns. (Tr. 105) Applicant assured that he intends to pay a substantial amount to \naddress his federal tax debt after the IRS confirms the amount of his tax debt. (Tr. 27, \n101) After making the substantial initial payment to the IRS, he intends to make $1,000 \nmonthly payments until his federal income tax debt is paid. (Tr. 27) He hopes to have an \nestablished payment plan with the IRS by the end of 2019.

(Tr. 119) He promised to be financially responsible in the future. \n(Tr. 119-120) He emphasized his history of support to the Department of Defense and his \nconscientious compliance with security requirements. \n \nA close friend of 10 years described Applicant as reliable, conscientious, and \ntrustworthy. (SOR response, Tab D) A former coworker and friend of 15 years lauded \nApplicant\u2019s integrity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. (SOR response, Tab D) \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 performance review detailed his contributions to his employer and \noutstanding performance. (SOR response, Tab E) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was financially irresponsible, and his marriage to her ended in \ndivorce. Applicant\u2019s daughter had medical problems requiring multiple hospitalizations. \nApplicant was unemployed for several months in 2009 and 2013. These are \ncircumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. However, these \ncircumstances are insufficiently detailed to prove he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He received financial advice from accountants and attorneys, and he \ngenerated a budget. He made financial progress paying several debts, resolving his \nmortgage debt, and filing all required tax returns. However, in light of his long history of \nnot timely filing his tax returns and his current delinquent tax debts, there are not clear \nindications his financial problems are under control.  \n \nApplicant is credited with mitigating SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d (paid taxes for tax year 2015), 1.h \n(honestly believed he did not need to file tax returns in state M), 1.i (paid tax debt for state \nM for tax year 2017), and 1.j (resolved mortgage debt).  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and \nstate tax returns and pay his federal income tax debt is more persuasive. He did not \nestablish that he was unable to better address his delinquent taxes. He did not provide \nproof that he diligently attempted to establish payment plans to address his federal \nincome tax that he learned were delinquent several years ago. He did not establish a \ntrack record of payment of his delinquent federal income taxes.  \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege he did not timely file his federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years 2006 and 2007. The record is not clear about when or if those tax \nreturns were filed. I did not consider the failure to timely file his 2006 and 2007 federal \nand state tax returns for any purpose.  \n \nApplicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. \nFrom October 2018 to August 2019, he filed his federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2009 through 2016; however, his filings of those tax returns were not timely.   \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \n  \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, \n317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States \nv. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. \n1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts:  \n \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \n \nEven if no taxes are owed when tax returns are filed, the Appeal Board provided the \nfollowing principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: \n \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules \nand regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  \n \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies in part because he filed his tax returns and paid some of his required taxes; \nhowever, the timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect of the analysis. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the \ngrant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nIn sum, Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years \n2009 to 2016. He estimated he owed the IRS $71,000 not including penalties and interest. \nHe believes all of his tax returns are filed, and his state income taxes are paid. There is \ninsufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to timely file his tax returns for tax \nyears 2009 to 2016. He did not establish he was unable to make greater progress \nresolving his delinquent tax debts. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns for the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g.  \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old senior account executive for a defense contractor. In \n2013, he separated from his spouse, and in 2016, he was divorced, ending a 29-year \nmarriage. Applicant accepted responsibility for all of the debts from their marriage \nincluding his mortgage.  \n \nA close friend of 10 years and a former coworker and friend of 15 years described \nApplicant as reliable, conscientious, professional, honest, and trustworthy. His 2019 \nperformance review detailed his outstanding performance. He held a security clearance \nfor many years. There are no allegations of security violations. \n \nApplicant owes about $71,000 to the IRS for tax years 2009 ($25,000), 2011 \n($9,000), 2013 ($5,000), and 2016 ($32,000), excluding penalties and interest. Applicant \nassured that he intends to pay a substantial amount to address his federal tax debt after \nthe IRS confirms the amount of his tax debt. After making the substantial payment, he \nintends to make $1,000 monthly payments until his federal income tax debt is paid. \nApplicant does not have an established payment plan agreeable to the IRS to address \nhis federal income tax debt. He filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2009 to 2016 from October 2018 to August 2019.   \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and \npaid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The \nAppeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-\ntax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted)). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe primary problem here relates to Applicant\u2019s handling of his federal and state \nincome taxes. Applicant knew that he needed to file his federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2009 through 2016, and he did not file them until October 2018 to August 2019.  \nApplicant assured that he intends to pay a substantial amount to address his federal tax \ndebt after the IRS confirms the amount of his tax debt. He evidently has the financial \nresources available now to make a substantial down payment on his tax debt without \nwaiting to negotiate a settlement with the IRS. He promised to timely file his tax returns \nin the future. However, he owes a federal income tax debt that is not in an established \npayment plan. He had a legal requirement to timely file his tax returns and pay his taxes. \nHe may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of these requirements. \nHe procrastinated. He did not establish he was unable to make greater progress resolving \nhis delinquent taxes. His actions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too \nlate to fully mitigate security concerns. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about [his] reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Apostol, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/21/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an application for a public trust position (PTA) on March 7, \n2018. On December 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 22, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. On March 15, 2019, the Government sent a complete copy \nof its written case to Applicant, consisting of a file of relevant material (FORM) including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 5. She was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on March 20, 2019, \nand timely submitted her response, to which the Government did not object. Items 1 and \n2 are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 5 are admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \nFORM response included a copy of the FORM, Item 2, and Item 5, which was already \npart of the record. She also submitted three new documents, which are admitted into \nevidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. The case was assigned to me on May \n31, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted the below findings of fact from Applicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 2) and her PTA \n(Item 3). \n \nApplicant, age 39, has one adult child and one minor child. She has never married. \nShe earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2008. She has been employed by a federal \ncontractor as an accounting clerk since March 2018. She has not had any periods of \nunemployment during the last ten years. This is her first application for a position of trust.  \n \n \nApplicant admits each of the nine debts alleged in the SOR, including $4,967 for \nfederal taxes; $3,180 for state taxes; $20,834 for federal student loans; and $11,764 for \nsix credit card accounts.  \n \nApplicant established installment agreements to repay her federal taxes in 2017 \nand 2018. Her balance as of October 2018 was $4,731. She has made timely payments \npursuant to those agreements through March 2019. (AE A; Item 5 at 2-3, 19, 23, 24, 25, \n27, and 28).   \n \nApplicant established a payment plan to repay her state taxes in July 2018, at \nwhich time a 2014 overpayment of $307 was applied to her balance. She renewed her \npayment plan in April 2019 with monthly payments of $50 to begin May 2019. Her balance \nas of April 2019 was $3,424. The record does not establish that any payments have been \nmade pursuant to either agreement. (AE C; Item 5 at 31, 51-52).  \n \nApplicant initiated action to repay her student loans beginning with $50 monthly \npayments in March 2018, which she timely paid through October 2018. In October 2018, \nshe formalized a $50 monthly payment plan. The record does not establish that any \npayments have been made since October 2018. (Item 5 at 54 and 56).  \n \nApplicant engaged the services of a debt-relief company and established a plan to \nrepay her credit-card debt in March 2018. She has timely paid $252 per month pursuant \nto that plan through April 2019. As of November 2018, two of the alleged debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g and 1.h) had been resolved. The record does not establish the status of the remaining \ndebts. (AE B; Item 5 at 57-62, and 67-68). \n \nApplicant attributed her financial indebtedness to a period between approximately \n2012 and 2018 when her expenses exceeded her income due primarily to increased \ncommuting expenses, and to credit-card debt that she incurred to aid a friend in need, \nwho reneged on a promise to help her repay that debt. Between 2012 and 2014, after a \nrelocation, Applicant experienced increased expenses associated with an extraordinarily \n\n \n3 \n \nlong commute for routine visits with her children. Between 2014 and 2015, after she \nmoved to the same town as her children, she continued to experience expenses \nassociated with an extraordinarily long commute to work. In 2015, she became employed \nin the same town in which she and her children lived, but her income did not suffice to \nmeet her monthly expenses. After becoming gainfully employed in March 2018, she had \nsufficient funds to address her delinquent debts. (Item 5 at 8; Item 3 at 37). \n \nApplicant\u2019s income is now sufficient to meet her monthly expenses, including the \npayment arrangements that she established to repay her delinquent debts. She believes \nthat it is important to repay her debts and intends to continue making the payments that \nshe promised to her creditors. (Item 5 at 18-19). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \n(Directive, \u00a7 3.2). \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust to support a DOD \ncontract, an administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nin the AG. (Directive, Enclosure 2). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthe guidelines in a  commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable \ninformation, in arriving at a fair and impartial decision.  \n \nIn addition to the guidelines, the Directive sets forth procedures that must be \nfollowed in trustworthiness adjudications. The Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to establish their eligibility for a public trust position. (Directive, Enclosure 3, \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14, E3.1.15). The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely pay federal and state income taxes, federal student \nloans, and credit-card debts establish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired\u201d). \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns raised in the SOR have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant initiated action to resolve her delinquent debts before issuance of the \nSOR. She has established a meaningful track record of regular and timely payments, and \n\n \n5 \n \nher actions demonstrate that she will follow through with her agreements to repay her \nremaining delinquent debts. Given the facts and circumstances underlying the debts \nalleged in the SOR, and in light of the responsible manner in which she has addressed \nthem, I conclude that they are not likely to recur. Applicant is otherwise managing her \nfinances responsibly. While she is not currently debt-free, I do not find that her finances \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. ISCR Case No. \n15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (An applicant does not have to be debt-free in \norder to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act \nresponsibly given [her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to \neffectuate the plan). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher failure to timely pay federal and state income taxes, federal student loans, and credit- \ncard debts. Accordingly, Applicant has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant her eligibility for a public trust \nposition. \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a public trust position.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. In a \nresponse transmitted on January 30, 2019, he admitted the eight allegations raised and \nrequested a determination based on the written record.  \nOn February 21, 2019, the Government issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) with four attachments (\u201cItems\u201d). The case was assigned to me on May 10, \n2019. Based on my review of the case file and submissions, I find Applicant failed to \nmitigate drug involvement security concerns. \n     Findings of Fact \nApplicant is a 23-year-old man who, as last documented, was anticipating \ngraduation from undergraduate school in May 2018. (Form, Item 4) At the time he was \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \ninterviewed as part of this process, he was a part-time intramural sports supervisor. He \nhas also held other part-time jobs typical of a university student. He has been extended \nan offer for a position by a defense contractor.  \n \nIn about November 2010, during his freshman year in high school, Applicant first \ntried marijuana after a friend brought it to his home. The marijuana plant \u201cbud\u201d provided \nwas sufficient to make one \u201cblunt\u201d suitable for smoking. (FORM, Item 4) Applicant knew \nusing the substance was illegal, but he had a \u201cdesire to try it.\u201d (FORM, Item 4)  After an \nunrecalled number of inhalations, he felt the drug\u2019s effects. Applicant continued to use \nthe drug because he \u201cenjoyed it.\u201d (FORM, Item 4) He used the drug, on average, one or \ntwo times a week until at least December 2018. (FORM, Item 4) No information \nregarding his drug use after that date was offered. \n \nBefore his December 2018 usage, Applicant first purchased about 3.5 ounces of \nmarijuana. While he knew the purchase was illegal, he did so because \u201che wanted to.\u201d \n(FORM, Item 4) Initially, Applicant noted that he intended to use marijuana into the \nfuture if it was legalized, he then later stated he intended to quit using it in the future -- \n\u201cafter 5/2018 and college\u201d -- to focus on work. (FORM, Item 4) At that point, he planned \nto \u201ckick his habit\u201d of marijuana use. (FORM, Item 4) He noted that he had been unaware \nthat federal law specifically prohibits the use of illegal drugs by employees of defense \ncontractors. Applicant concedes he was immature when he began using the drug, but \nrepresents himself now as mature. (FORM, Item 4) He considers his drug use to be \nvoluntary and not very serious because he believes he can cease his \u201chabit\u201d whenever \nhe needs to do so.  \n \nIn his teens and early 20s, Applicant also tried illegal hallucinogenic mushrooms \nin June 2017. He used Adderall that had been prescribed to another individual from \nabout February 2015 to about May 2017. He similarly used someone else\u2019s prescription \nHydrocodone on multiple occasions in about November 2015. About twice, he \nrecreationally used another person\u2019s Xanax, from about February 2012 to about \nOctober 2015. Throughout this time, he was aware it was illegal to use someone else\u2019s \nprescription medication. (FORM, Item 4) Applicant socially tried the hallucinogenic \ncompound known as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), in August 2015. Before going out \nto socialize and party over alcoholic beverages once in February 2015, he also used \ncocaine.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under the \nAG, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national interest. In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. Under the Directive, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Such use also raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Here, Applicant admitted that he used multiple \nillegal drugs or illegally used prescription drugs between November 2010 and at least \nDecember 2018. During that time frame, he also purchased illegal substances. These \nadmitted facts are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25: \n \n(a) any substance misuse . . , and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,  \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as confirmed by Applicant\u2019s own admissions, \nraises security concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns.  \n \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of \nabstinence, including but not limited to: (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 26(a), Applicant\u2019s marijuana \u201chabit\u201d continued from his early \nteenage years into his 20s. It is unclear whether he actually ceased socially using illegal \ndrugs after college graduation or thereafter. It is shown, however, that any decision to \nquit marijuana use would be based, at least in part, on whether the drug continued to be \nclassified as illegal, whether its cessation was needed to help him focus on his career, \nor both. His current relationship with marijuana and other drugs is unclear and left \nundefined, as is his relationship with both peers who use and purchase drugs and \nvenues in which illegal drug use is accepted. What is clear is that his knowing use of \nillegal substances continued up to at least the time he was offered professional \nemployment with a defense contractor. However, with scant supplemental information \nor argument justifying or mitigating such drug use, AG \u00b6 26(a)-(b) do not apply under \nthese facts.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nanalysis based on the record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s drug use, I considered available \nfacts related to his age, reasons for using illegal drugs or illegally using prescription \nmedications, maturation, professional status, educational attainments, lifestyle, and \nfuture intentions regarding illegal substances.  \n \nThis is not a situation involving youthful indiscretion. During his period of \nmarijuana abuse, Applicant has matured from a young teen to a man in his mid-20s \npursuing a professional position with a defense contractor. While it may be unclear \nwhether he knew all along that marijuana use was antithetical to working for a defense \ncontractor, it was shown he has admitted knowing some, if not all, of his drug use was \npatently illegal. Cases under this guideline can be reviewed with consideration of a \nnumber of factors that might prove to be mitigating or may show circumstances that \nwere extenuating. Here, however, Applicant has simply admitted the SOR allegations \nwith no rebuttal. Without more, drug involvement security concerns remain unmitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

He did not list that \ndelinquency on his September 2017 security clearance application. Some extenuating \ncircumstances led to him to default on the loan, but no payments have been made on the \ndebt. His explanation for not listing the debt on his clearance application is implausible. \nFinancial considerations and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn December 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n\n2 \n \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn January 14, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record without a hearing by an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On May 22, 2019, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of four exhibits (Items 1-4). \nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant through his employer on May 23, 2019, \nand instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on \nJune 17, 2019. No response to the FORM was received by the July 17, 2019 deadline. On \nAugust 16, 2019, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nI received the case file on August 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the December 31, 2018 SOR, \nApplicant owed a $70,000 collection debt to a foreign bank (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline \nE, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his September 25, 2017 security \nclearance application by not disclosing the delinquent loan in response to a foreign \nfinancial interest inquiry (SOR \u00b6 2.a) or to inquiries concerning delinquencies involving \nroutine accounts in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.b). (Item 1.) When Applicant responded \nto the SOR allegations, he admitted the debt, which he indicated was \u201ca one-off, highly \nunusual situation.\u201d He explained that he obtained the loan to consolidate debts and pay \nrent, but his employer then reneged on a $15,000 promised bonus, which placed him in a \nfinancial bind. He then made a \u201chasty, ill-advised decision\u201d while on annual leave not to \nreturn to his job. Applicant denied that he intentionally failed to disclose his loan with a \nforeign bank, stating in part, \u201cI did not give the account a second thought while filling out \nthe form, as I considered it closed in my mind.\u201d (Item 2.) After considering the FORM, \nwhich includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old U.S. defense-contractor employee married to a foreign \nnational. He has three adult stepchildren. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. \nmilitary from May 1987 until he retired at the rank of master sergeant in April 2010. At the \ntime of his retirement, he held a Top Secret clearance. (Items 3-4.) \n \nFrom April 2010 to September 2012, Applicant worked as a weapons technician for \na defense contractor on a military installation in the United States. He owned his home, \nwhich he had purchased in October 2004. (Item 3.) \n \n \nIn September 2012, Applicant accepted a position as a weapons technician in a \ncountry in West Asia (foreign country X). He was promised a $15,000 bonus in his \nemployment contract. His spouse moved to Europe, and Applicant rented out his home in \nthe United States. Applicant\u2019s rent in foreign country X was $1,000 per month, with the rent \ndue in six-month installments. His new employer fronted his rent for the first six months \n\n3 \n \nwhile withdrawing the funds paid on his behalf from his paychecks starting immediately. \nApplicant indicated in response to the SOR that he lost his tenants in his U.S. home and \nwas not able to save sufficient money to cover his rent due in April 2013 for the next six \nmonths. (Item 2.) The file does not contain any information about Applicant\u2019s employment \nincome, his military retirement pay, his rental income from the home in the United States, \nor his mortgage payments for that home. \n \n \nWith rumors swirling on the job that his employer would not be paying the $15,000 \nbonus to its employees, Applicant obtained a loan of $68,064 from a bank in foreign \ncountry X to cover his rent and other bills and expenses. He borrowed additional funds \nfrom the bank to bring his loan balance to $70,000. When his employer reneged on the \nbonus, Applicant was placed in a financial bind. He made only six or seven payments on \nthe bank loan. Facing pressure from his spouse to stay with her in Europe, Applicant \nresigned from his job in foreign country X in October 2013. (Items 2-4.) \n \n \nFrom October 2013 to September 2017, Applicant lived off his military pension while \nearning his bachelor\u2019s degree online. He made no payments toward his loan with the \nforeign bank after he left foreign country X. In September 2017, Applicant began his \ncurrent employment as an aircraft servicer with a U.S. defense contractor in Europe. (Item \n3.) Applicant indicates that he now has his master\u2019s degree (Item 2), although he presented \nno details about how or when he earned that degree. \n \n \nOn September 25, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). Applicant listed his previous \nemployment in foreign country X on his SF 86, and gave as his reason for leaving \n\u201cContract dispute. The company failed to pay our bonus.\u201d  He did not list the defaulted loan \nwith the foreign bank on his SF 86. He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning \nwhether he, his spouse, or any dependent children have ever had any foreign financial \ninterests in which he or they had direct control or direct ownership, such as \u201cstocks, \nproperty, investments, bank accounts, ownership of corporate entities, corporate interests \nor exchange traded funds (ETFs) held in specific geographical or economic sectors,\u201d and \ndisclosed his interests in the European country where he and his spouse reside. He \nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to a question concerning whether he, his spouse, or any dependent \nchildren, had any additional foreign financial interests. He also responded negatively to \ninquiries into any financial delinquency involving routine accounts in the last seven years, \nincluding whether he had defaulted on any type of loan in the past seven years; whether he \nhad any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency in the past seven years; whether \nhe had any account suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed in the \nlast seven years; and whether he was currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt. \n(Item 3.) \n \n \nOn April 9, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). About foreign financial interests, he indicated that \nhe and his spouse had closed their previous bank account in their locale and opened a \nnew checking account with another bank in March 2018 because it did not charge fees, \nApplicant was then confronted with developed information about the loan with the bank in \n\n4 \n \nforeign country X. He indicated that he had acquired the loan in 2012 to pay rent, bills, and \nextra expenses and to pay off a home that he owns in the United States; that he defaulted \non the loan after only six to seven payments; and that he currently owes a collection \nbalance of $70,000. He explained that he could not afford to repay the loan because he \nwas not paid a bonus promised by his then employer. He admitted that he has been \nreceiving notices about the debt from the foreign bank and that he had told the bank of his \nintention to repay the loan when he sells his home in the United States. Applicant asserted \nthat his omission of the collection debt from his SF 86 was unintentional. He stated that he \ndid not think of this collection account when completing his SF 86. In December 2018, \nApplicant adopted as accurate the summary report of his April 2019 interview containing \nthese statements. (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant maintains that his default on the loan with the foreign bank was \u201ca one off, \nhighly unusual situation\u201d for him when considering the whole-person concept. He stated \nthat he had a spotless credit rating before 2013, and that there were extenuating \ncircumstances, including the loss of tenants in his U.S. property, which compromised his \nability to pay his rent in foreign country X. As for his former employer\u2019s failure to pay him \nhis $15,000 bonus, Applicant asserted without any corroboration that he had been \ncontractually promised the bonus, but also that he had no recourse against his former \nemployer. Under \u201cimmense family pressure\u201d to return to Europe, he made \u201ca hasty, ill-\nadvised decision\u201d to leave his job in foreign country X. He asserted that he has stabilized \nhis situation over the past five years by earning both his undergraduate and master\u2019s \ndegrees and obtaining his current job. He added that he has \u201ctaken a lessons learned \napproach so that nothing like that can affect [him] again.\u201d (Item 2.) He did not elaborate \nabout the lessons learned. \n \n \nRegarding the alleged deliberate omission of his defaulted loan from his SF 86, in \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant stated, in part: \n \nThe [foreign bank] incident occurred over four years earlier and I did not give \nthe account a second thought while filling out the form, as I considered it \nclosed in my mind. While this certainly seems implausible, I can only offer to \nthe Judge that when asked about the [foreign bank] account by the agent in \nmy second interview, I immediately apologized to the officer and detailed in \ngood-faith not only the account, but the circumstances surrounding the entire \nsituation; the fact that it was a loan, what the loan was for, and that it was in \narrears. In the same manner, I updated the officer on another [European] \nbank account that had been opened subsequent to the original interview. I \ngave this information willingly and promptly; there was never any refusal to \ndisclose any information. (Item 2.) \n \n \nApplicant also asserted in his response to the SOR that he has exceeded his \nsupervisors\u2019 expectations in his current position and that he has performed his duties \nwithout incident, showing that he is still trustworthy and reliable. He expressed regret for \nthe loan default (\u201cthis singular incident\u201d) which he submitted \u201cwas an anomaly in an \notherwise long history of honorable service to America.\u201d (Item 2.) \n\n5 \n \n \nThe record contains a report of only one subject interview of Applicant, which was \nconducted on April 9, 2018, as summarized in Item 4. Applicant presented no \ndocumentation from his employer or co-workers attesting to the quality of his work \nperformance. As of the close of the record in July 2019, he has made no payments since \nOctober 2013 on the defaulted $70,000 loan owed to the foreign bank. There is no \nevidence that Applicant has sold his property in the United States. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant defaulted on a $70,000 loan with a bank in foreign country X in 2013. He \nhas made no payments on that loan since October 2013, and his account is in collection \nstatus. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b), \n\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. The \nfollowing conditions under AG \u00b6 20 have some applicability: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n7 \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability in that his default of the loan does not appear to \nbe characteristic of his handling of his finances generally. Even so, the debt is considered \nrecent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. \n15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant has made no efforts since October \n2013 to address this sizeable loan delinquency, for which he is legally liable. He admitted \nduring his April 2018 subject interview that the bank was sending him notices about the \ndebt, which was in collection status. His ongoing disregard of that debt continues to cast \ndoubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant knowingly took the position in foreign country X. \nHis then employer fronted his rent for the first six months. It was not established that the \nemployer violated the terms of Applicant\u2019s employment contract by immediately \ncommencing recoupment of those funds from his pay. The loss of rental income from his \nU.S. property was an unexpected circumstance that led Applicant to acquire the loan from \nthe foreign bank so that he could pay some bills. Applicant also had no control over his \nemployer\u2019s decision to renege on his promised $15,000 bonus, which he planned to put \ntoward his loan. \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant remained in \ncontact with his creditor and attempted to make repayment arrangements. Applicant made \nfinancial decisions in his self-interest. While on leave in 2013, he made a self-described \n\u201chasty, ill-advised decision\u201d to remain in Europe with his spouse rather than return to his \njob in foreign country X. He is not faulted for putting his family first, but over the next four \nyears, he lived off his military retirement income with no showing of any credible effort to \nobtain employment income that could have gone towards resolving his defaulted loan. He \nused some of the money borrowed from the foreign bank to pay off the mortgage on his \nhome in the United States, and he has told the bank that he would repay his loan when he \nsold the house. There is no evidence that he has made any attempt to sell his U.S. \nproperty. The Appeal Board recently reiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. \n19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d \nHis failure to make any progress toward resolving his $70,000 collection debt raises \nconsiderable doubt about his willingness to pay it. The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \n \n\n8 \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nApplicant certified to the accuracy of a September 2017 SF 86 on which he \nresponded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning any foreign financial interests, and he \nlisted only his interests in Europe. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to an inquiry into any other foreign \nfinancial interests and to all of the inquiries involving any delinquency involving routine \naccounts in the last seven years, including questions specifically pertaining to loan defaults \nand debts turned over to a collection agency. Applicant denies any deliberate \nmisrepresentation, explaining that, however \u201cimplausible\u201d it may seem, he did not think \nabout his defaulted loan with the bank in West Asia when he was completing the form, \u201cas \n[he] considered it closed in [his] mind.\u201d He gave a similar explanation when he was asked \nabout the omission during his April 2018 interview \u2014 that he did not think of the account \nwhen he was completing his security questionnaire \u2014 although he did not then explain why \nthe debt did not occur to him at the time. \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish a falsification, it is not \nenough merely to demonstrate that an applicant\u2019s answers were not true. To raise security \nconcerns under Guideline E, the answers must be deliberately false. In analyzing an \napplicant\u2019s intent, the administrative judge must consider an applicant\u2019s answers in light of \nthe record evidence as a whole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05005 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, \n2017): ISCR Case No. 10-04821 (App. Bd. May 21, 2012). The foreign financial interest \ninquiries may not have triggered Applicant\u2019s recall of his defaulted loan, given that the \nlanguage focuses on foreign financial interests in which he, his spouse, or dependent \nchildren have had direct control or ownership, such as \u201cstocks, property, investments, bank \naccounts, ownership of corporate entities, corporate interests or exchange traded funds \n(ETFs) held in specific geographical or economic sectors.\u201d A loan is an obligation, not an \nasset that one controls. However, no reasonable ambiguity exists as to whether Applicant \nwas required to list the loan in response to the financial delinquency inquiries. The SF 86 \nfinancial inquiries concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts include the \nfollowing questions: \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, [have] you defaulted on any type of loan?\u201d \nand \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency.\u201d He listed his employment in foreign country X on his SF 86, and he gave as his \nreason for leaving \u201cContract dispute. The company failed to pay our bonus.\u201d His experience \nin foreign country X was clearly on his mind when he completed his SF 86. Moreover, the \nevidence shows that Applicant disclosed the loan during his subject interview only after he \nwas confronted about the loan. He admitted that he had received delinquent account \nnotices from the foreign bank and that he knew the loan is in collections. Based on those \n\n9 \n \nfacts, it is disingenuous of Applicant to claim that he gave no thought to the debt because \nhe considered it closed in his mind. His denial of deliberate falsification or omission is not \npersuasive. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applies because of his false responses to \nthe relevant financial delinquency inquiries on his SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) provides: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nRegarding possible mitigation under AG \u00b6 17, Applicant stated in January 2019 that \nwhen asked about the account during his second interview, he immediately apologized and \ndetailed the circumstances surrounding the loan. The FORM does not include any report of \nany interview other than the interview held on April 9, 2018. At that interview, Applicant had \nto be confronted about the defaulted loan before he was forthcoming with the details. AG \u00b6 \n17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, \nor falsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d therefore does not apply. There is no \nevidence that Applicant omitted the information about his defaulted loan based on \nimproper advice, so AG \u00b6 17(b) also is not established. That mitigating condition states: \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a personal with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully. \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 2017 deliberate omission of a $70,000 delinquent debt owed \nto a foreign bank is not considered so minor or so distant in the past. His apparent lack of \ninitial candor about the debt during his subject interview brings the concerns about his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness even more recent. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. It \nprovides: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s present denials of intentional falsification or omission do \nnot show the reform needed for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d), which states: \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n\n10 \n \n \nApplicant has largely mitigated issues of potential vulnerability under AG \u00b6 17(e),\u201dthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress,\u201d by providing details about the debt during his background \ninvestigation, albeit after he was confronted. Yet it is unclear whether his current employer \nknows that he owes a substantial delinquency to a foreign bank that he continues to ignore. \nFor the reasons noted, the personal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline F and \nGuideline E, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant accepted a job in West Asia \nonly to leave the job one year later saddled with a $70,000 loan debt. He acquired the debt \nvoluntarily, and he benefitted from the credit extended to him in that he paid off some bills \nand apparently the mortgage on his property in the United States. He asserts that he has \ntaken \u201ca lessons learned approach so that nothing like that can affect [him] again. By \nviewing his situation from the perspective of a victim of bad circumstances rather than \ntaking responsibility for his own actions, Applicant has yet to demonstrate that he \npossesses the sound judgment and reliability that must be expected of persons entrusted \nwith classified information. His years of military service are viewed favorably, but it is not \nenough to mitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns.   \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended as punishment for past specific \nconduct. The security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an \napplicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, self-control, and \nother characteristics essential to protecting national security information. Applicant \npresented little information to overcome the security concerns. It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \n\n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial \nhistory. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86 format) on February 26, 2018. This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. On December 13, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), \nexplaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.1  It detailed the factual reasons for \n                                                          \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \n\n2 \n \nthe action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 24, 2019, and requested a decision based on \nthe written record without a hearing.   \n \nOn February 22, 2019, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  \n(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on February 25, 2019. He was given 30 \ndays to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on March 6, 2019. Applicant did \nnot respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 10, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nIncluded in the FORM were eight items of evidence, which are marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Exhibits 1 through 3 and 5 through 8 are admitted \ninto evidence without objection. Exhibit 4 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing \nApplicant\u2019s interview that took place during the July 2018 background investigation. The \nROI is not authenticated, as required under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive.3 Department \nCounsel\u2019s written brief includes a prominent paragraph advising Applicant that the \nsummary was not authenticated and that failure to object may constitute a waiver of the \nauthentication requirement. I am not, however, persuaded that a pro se applicant\u2019s failure \nto respond to the FORM, which response is optional, equates to a knowing and voluntary \nwaiver of the authentication requirement. The record does not demonstrate that Applicant \nunderstood the concepts of authentication, waiver, and admissibility. It also does not \ndemonstrate that he understood the implications of waiving an objection to the \nadmissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, GE 4 is inadmissible, and I have not considered the \ninformation in the ROI.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 63 years old, married, previously divorced with three children. \nApplicant had four children, but he lost a child in 2006. He served in the U. S. Army from \n1972 to 1987 and was honorably discharged. Applicant then earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 2000 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. Since February 2017, he has been \nemployed by a defense contractor. Before his current employment, Applicant was \nunemployed since November 2014.4  \n                                                          \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 7, 2017 apply here.  \n \n2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting documentation \nwhich are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  \n \n3 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra\u2019anan \nnotes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present \na heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra\u2019anan raises a number \nof pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.). \n \n4 GE 2 and GE 3.  \n \n\n3 \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin April 2011 that was dismissed at his request in December 2011. The SOR also alleges \nthat Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2012 that was discharged in March \n2013.5 The SOR also alleges six delinquent debts totaling $16,712, of which $4,076 are \nmedical debts.6 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations.7 \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant explained that he filed the first bankruptcy (Chapter 13) in \nan effort to reduce his indebtedness. He requested a dismissal when he recognized that \nhe could not keep up with the plan payments. Applicant filed the second bankruptcy \n(Chapter 7) following his inability to pay for his home and a new vehicle. He described a \nseries of events that stressed his family\u2019s finances during this period, including the loss \nof a child and the loss of his wife\u2019s income when she moved to another state to care for \nher father.8 As noted, Applicant also was unemployed from November 2014 to February \n2017.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g.9 Applicant did not respond \nto SOR \u00b6 1.h, which is a collection account supported by the evidence.10 Applicant did \nnot provide any documentation to support the claims made in his Answer.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.11 As noted \nby the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d12 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about \nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved \nin favor of protecting national security.  \n \n                                                          \n5 GE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \n6 GE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.h.  \n \n7 GE 2.  \n \n8 GE 2 \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \n9 GE 2 \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.g. Applicant claims that SOR \u00b6 1.c now has a balance of $800, SOR \u00b6 1.d is a \nduplicate, and SOR \u00b6 1.f is being paid off (balance now $218 or less). Applicant correctly pointed out that \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged three medical debts in identical amounts with the same dates of last activity. The date \nof the report, date assigned, and date of balance are also identical. GE 5.  \n \n10 GE 5, p. 4.  \n \n11 Department of Navy v.

Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10TH Cir. 2002) (no right to a \nsecurity clearance).  \n \n12 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n4 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.13 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.14 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.15 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.16 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.17 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.18 \n \n \nIn Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a \npreponderance of evidence.19 The Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and \na judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20 \n \nDiscussion  \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations  \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,21 the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness, financial problems, or difficulties. The overall concern is: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.22 \n                                                          \n13 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n14 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n15 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n16 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n17 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n18 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n19 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n20 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n21 AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n \n22 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n5 \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might \nknowingly compromise classified information to obtain money or something \nelse of value. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other important qualities. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in \nhandling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial \nhistory sufficient to raise a security concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). Applicant has \nproduced no documentation to support his answers to the SOR debts. In fact, the \nevidence is contrary to his answers. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that \napplicants must present documentation to support their claims that debts have been \nresolved.23 I conclude that except for one SOR debt, none of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions apply.24 \n                                                          \n23 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008) (it is reasonable for a judge to expect \nan applicant to present documentation about the satisfaction or other resolution of individual debts); ISCR \nCase No. 06-17520 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2007). \n \n24 I find that GE 5 supports Applicant\u2019s claim that SOR \u00b6 1. d alleges duplicate debts. The correct debt \nshould be $1,108, not thrice that amount. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies.  \n \n\n6 \n \n \nThe record creates doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.25 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n   Against Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h:                 Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Conclusion \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information.  \n \n \n \nPhilip J.

Applicant began experiencing serious financial difficulties in 2011, which \nwere aggravated by her separation from her husband in 2012 and divorce in 2014. She \ntestified and submitted a number of exhibits. Based upon the record as a whole, her \nevidence in mitigation was insufficient in light of her significant, long-standing debts. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 28, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) setting forth numerous \nallegations under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960); DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), \nas amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \n\n2 \n \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), \nfor all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nOn May 16, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting most of the SOR \nallegations with additional comments in mitigation. She requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On August \n2, 2019, the case was assigned to me, and DOHA issued a notice of hearing on the same \nday, scheduling the hearing on August 19, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented eight \nproposed exhibits, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel offered ten proposed exhibits and sets of exhibits, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through J. All exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. I \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 30, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted 13 of the 14 SOR allegations with \nexplanations. She denied one allegation because it alleges a duplicate debt. I have \nincorporated her admissions in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is \nextracted from GE 1, her security clearance application, dated September 11, 2017, \n(SCA) unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and \nthe documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 49, has worked as a software engineer for a defense contractor since \n2017. She was born in a foreign country, entered the United States with her family as a \nchild, and became a U.S. citizen at the age of 19. She earned a bachelor\u2019s of science \ndegree in 1992. She has worked as a technical engineer or support analyst since then. \nShe submitted her SCA in connection with her current employment. She is a first-time \napplicant.  \n \n \nIn 1995, Applicant married, and she and her husband had two children, ages 16 \nand 9. In 2011, her financial situation became unstable. In March of that year, her \nhusband lost his job, and in June, she was unemployed for about five months. Their home \nhad a nearly $800,000 mortgage with a monthly payment of $3,798. Their ability to pay \ntheir mortgage and their significant amount of credit-card debt became a serious problem. \nHer husband withdrew significant amounts from his 401K retirement accounts and \nincurred a substantial tax liability. Applicant claims that much of her credit-card debt was \nincurred during the medical treatment of her oldest child, who was diagnosed with serious \nillnesses as an infant and then again a few years later. She also attributes the financial \nhardships she and her husband have experienced to his loss of a business he started in \n2007 and closed in 2009 due to the economic recession at that time and to his ongoing \nperiods of unemployment until sometime after 2014. In April of 2012, they were able to \nsell their residence in a short sale for $680,000, and the mortgage lender forgave the \nremaining debt. (App. Ex B at 3-5, 7-8, 10, Ex. E; Tr. 34-35, 80.) \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant separated from her husband in December 2012, and they divorced in \nJune 2014. Their separation was due, at least in part, to the financial problems they were \nexperiencing. She and her ex-husband agreed to share joint custody of the children. \nUnder their marital settlement agreement (the 2014 Agreement), which was incorporated \ninto their court-approved judgment of dissolution, Applicant was required to pay her \nhusband $1,000 per month of child support and provide health-care insurance for their \nchildren. She was also obligated to pay all of the uninsured healthcare expenses of the \nchildren. Both parties agreed to waive any spousal support payments and any interest in \nthe other\u2019s retirement accounts. (AE B at 2, 7-8, 13.) \n \n \nAt the time of their divorce, the couple had significant outstanding tax and \nconsumer-credit debts from 2011. They divided their tax debt for 2011 evenly between \nthem, and they split the other debts. Several of the debts Applicant assumed are the \nsubjects of the allegations in the SOR. Two of the debts assumed by her ex-husband are \nalso alleged in the SOR. In the 2014 Agreement, the parties acknowledged that if one of \nthem does not pay a debt assign to him or her, the creditor can collect the entire debt \nfrom the other party. The only remedy for the party who pays the debt of the other is to \npetition the court for reimbursement. (AE B at 2, 7-8, 13, 26; Tr. 15-17, 22-24, 26, 69.) \n \n \nIn a letter dated April 2, 2019, about 12 days after Applicant received the SOR, \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband wrote that he had agreed to assume full responsibility for eight of \nApplicant\u2019s consumer debts and one-half of their joint federal tax liability for 2011. He was \nunemployed at the time he wrote this letter. She obtained this letter from her ex-husband \nat the suggestion of her attorney. The eight debts are all of Applicant\u2019s unpaid consumer \ndebts alleged in the SOR, taking into account a duplicate alleged debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and \n1.n.), specifically SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n. Applicant believed that \nthe 2014 Agreement was unfair because she waived her right to alimony. She believes \nthat this subsequent agreement (the Modification) made their divorce fairer. She testified \nthat at the same time the parties entered into the Modification, her ex-husband also \nagreed that she no longer needed to pay him child support, though the letter confirming \nthe prior oral Modification makes no mention of child support. She further testified that the \nModification was made a year or two after the 2014 divorce. It has never been formally \napproved by a court. (AE C; Tr. 56, 58-60.) \n \n \nThe record contains no evidence that Applicant\u2019s ex-husband has made any \npayments to any creditor, including the IRS, under the Modification. Applicant is unaware \nif her ex-husband is employed at this time. He had been working in State 1 until July 2018 \nand then he returned to live with Applicant in State 2. That did not work out, and he moved \nto an unknown location near her residence so that he can jointly share custody of their \nchildren with Applicant. Moreover, she testified that she has not asked him if he was \nactually paying her debts and his share of their 2011 federal taxes pursuant to the \nModification. Also, she provided no documentation evidencing any payments of the debts. \nShe acknowledges that his commitment to pay these debts does not absolve her of \nresponsibility for the debts. She is aware that her ex-husband is trying to clean up his \ncredit, which raises the possibility that he is only taking care of his personal debts. The \nage of the debts are such that they may no longer be enforceable by the creditors under \n\n4 \n \nthe applicable state statutes of limitations. This raises a concern as to whether Applicant\u2019s \nex-husband undertook responsibility for the debts with any intent to pay them. (Tr. 29-31, \n37, 55-57, 63-65; AE C.) \n \n \nNotwithstanding the Modification, Applicant listed most of the SOR debts in her \nSeptember 2017 SCA as her debts. Specifically, the tax debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d \nand eight of the consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n. \nShe did not list the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, a judgment obtained by a bank on a credit-\ncard account, which was listed in both the 2014 Agreement and the Modification as a debt \nfor which her ex-husband was responsible. She also stated in her November 2017 \nbackground interview that a number of the SOR debts belonged to her and that she \nintended to pay them. (GE 1 at 51-62; GE 3 at 7-13.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d \u2013 IRS tax debts and lien for 2011 and 2012 totaling $62,098. \nApplicant and her then-husband jointly filed their 2011 federal tax return in a timely \nmanner. Their combined income was almost $200,000. Their total withholding for that \nyear was only $698, which resulted in a tax liability of $52,318, plus penalties and interest. \nApplicant testified that the tax debt for 2011 was due to distributions from her husband\u2019s \n401K retirement account. In March 2014, the IRS filed a tax lien against both Applicant \nand her ex-husband for 2011 in the amount of $53,852. At one point, the IRS froze her \nbank account, apparently as a garnishment to collect her delinquent taxes. Applicant was \nunable to pay this tax debt for years because she had insufficient income. In 2017, the \nIRS determined that this tax debt was uncollectible and agreed to review the couple\u2019s \nfinancial situation annually. Applicant contacted the IRS in 2018 and again in January and \nMarch 2019 about her tax debt. They advised her to begin making monthly payments in \nMarch 2019 and that the IRS would review her situation further. On May 25, 2019, the \nIRS documented an installment agreement under which she will pay it $200 per month. \nShe also provided copies of check payments for the months of March, April, and May \n2019. Since then, the monthly payments have been automatically withdrawn from her \naccount. She acknowledges that if her husband pays no taxes under the Modification, \nshe will be liable for the entire amount. She has not discussed with her ex-husband \nwhether he is paying the IRS anything on their joint tax debt. (GE 6, 7; AE A, J; Tr. 35-\n36, 38, 70-71, 76-78.) \n \n \nDue to their separation in late 2011, Applicant filed her 2012 federal return as head \nof household. She had income of about $73,000 and withholding of only $2,834, resulting \nin a tax liability of $8,214, plus penalties and interest. In their 2014 Agreement, the couple \nagreed to divide their federal tax liability equally. Presumably, this 2012 tax debt was \nincluded in that arrangement. The Modification makes no mention of Applicant\u2019s 2012 tax \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s tax transcripts in the record reflect that she over withheld about $2,000 \nper year for the years 2013 through 2017, and that the IRS applied these excess \npayments to her 2011 joint tax liability with her ex-husband. (GE 2 at 18-21; Tr. 26.)  \n \n \nApplicant and her ex-husband also owed about $10,000 in state taxes for 2011. \nDuring a period in 2018 when her ex-husband was working in State 1, they jointly paid off \n\n5 \n \ntheir delinquent tax obligations to State 2. The SOR contains no allegation regarding \ndelinquent state taxes. (Tr. 66, 83.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 Judgment in the amount of $4,406 obtained by a collection \nagency on a bank credit-card account. Applicant defaulted on this credit card in or \nabout January 2011. She entered into a payment plan to pay this judgment in July 2017. \nShe paid off the debt in 2018. This debt is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. (GE 1 at 52, GE \n2 at 12, 16.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \u2013 Judgment obtained in July 2014 by a bank on a credit card \naccount. Applicant and her ex-husband had two credit card accounts with this card \nissuer. In 2011, she defaulted on the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f with a debt of about \n$5,000. In her SCA, she reported the debt on the judgment to be about $17,000. Under \nthe 2014 Agreement, each party assumed responsibility for one of these debts, but the \ndollar amounts of each debt is not stated. Applicant now denies responsibility for this debt \nbecause she believes her husband agreed to pay it in the Modification. (Tr. 39-42; GE 1 \nat 55.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g \u2013 Judgment obtained in January 2013 by a bank on a credit card \naccount. Applicant defaulted on this account in about 2011 with a debt of about $5,000. \nUnder the 2014 Agreement, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband assumed responsibility for this \njudgment. Applicant denies responsibility for this debt because she believes her husband \nagreed to pay it, both in the 2014 Agreement and in the Modification. This debt is resolved \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. (Tr. 41.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h \u2013 Credit-card account owed to a credit union that was charged off \nin the amount of $7,638. According to her notation in her SCA, Applicant defaulted on \nthis credit card in 2015. She testified that she defaulted on the debt in 2011. This debt is \nlisted as an obligation of her ex-husband in the 2014 Agreement. This debt is also listed \nin the Modification as an obligation of Applicant\u2019s ex-husband. This debt is resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. (Tr. 43; GE 1 at 61-62; GE 2 at 13, 17; GE 3 at 5; AE B, C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i \u2013 Defaulted bank loan owed in the amount of $1,427. Applicant \ndefaulted on this loan about the time of the 2014 Agreement. The debt is not allocated to \neither party in the 2014 Agreement. Applicant listed the debt as her obligation in her 2017 \nSCA. In her background interview, she described the debt as an overdraft on her bank \naccount. She now claims that her ex-husband has assumed responsibility for this debt, \nas reflected in the Modification. She has no knowledge as to whether he has paid or is \npaying this debt. (GE 1 at 61-62; GE 2 at 13; Tr. 44-45.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k \u2013 Credit-card accounts placed for collection in the amount \nof $33,336 and $2,377, respectively. In 2005, Applicant and her husband opened these \naccounts with the issuer. She testified that most of the expenses incurred on these \naccounts were related to their expenses in 2004 and 2007 caring for their seriously ill \nchild. She defaulted on the accounts in 2011. The 2014 Agreement provides for these \ndebts to be obligations of Applicant. She now claims that her husband has assumed these \n\n6 \n \nliabilities under the Modification. She has no knowledge as to whether he has paid or is \npaying this debt. (Tr. 46-47; GE 1 at 57; GE 2 at 13, 16; GE 3 at 4, 5; AE B, C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l \u2013 Credit-card account placed for collection in the amount of $785. \nThis account was jointly opened in 1999 by Applicant and her then-husband. Applicant \ndefaulted on it in 2011. The debt is not listed in the 2014 Agreement. It is listed as a debt \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband assumed in the Modification. (AE B, C; GE 1 at 56; GE 2 at 13, \n16; GE 3 at 5. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m \u2013 Credit-card account placed for collection in the amount of \n$8,034. Applicant and her then-husband jointly opened this account. They defaulted on it \nin 2011. In the 2014 Agreement, the debt is listed as an obligation of Applicant, however, \nApplicant claims that under the Modification, her ex-husband assumed responsibility for \nthe debt. She has no knowledge as to whether he has paid or is paying this debt. (Tr. 47-\n48; GE 1 at 54-55; GE 2 at 12, 16; AE B, C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n \u2013 Defaulted bank loan owed in the amount of $998. Applicant \npresented evidence that this debt is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. The \ncreditors alleged in the two SOR subparagraphs merged in February 2018. This allegation \nis resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. (AE E; Tr. 45-46, 64-65.) \n \n \nApplicant current finances are sound. She earns a significant income and spends \nresponsibly. She has three retirement accounts worth about $100,000. Since 2017, she \nhas accrued about $25,000 in the retirement account held by her current employer. She \nhas created and uses a budget and testified that she has received credit counseling. She \ndoes not presently have any credit-card accounts and has no new debts. (AE F at 13-14, \n17; Tr. 85.)  \n \n \nApplicant presented a number of character reference letters. They describe her as \na dedicated, hard-working, and respected co-worker. She is also described as an ethical \nperson with high moral character. Her references recommend her for a security clearance \nbecause of her reliability and integrity. She also submitted her employer\u2019s performance \nevaluations for 2017 and 2018 in which she was praised for her strong performance and \nwork ethic. She has received multiple awards and considers herself to be an exemplary \nemployee. (AE G, H; Tr. 19-20.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \n\n7 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s admissions in her SOR response and testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required.\u201d)  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; [and]  \n\n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s tax and defaulted consumer debts \narose in 2011 and 2012, without any recurrence since then. For that reason, it can be \nconcluded that her financial problems were infrequent and that they occurred under \nunusual circumstances. The fact that most of her debts remain outstanding precludes a \nconclusion that her financial behavior occurred long ago. The fact that the debts remain \nlargely unpaid about eight years later casts doubts about her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. The record clearly establishes that the \nconditions Applicant faced in 2011 and 2012 were circumstances beyond her control. \nThose circumstances started years earlier when her child was seriously ill on two \noccasions and she and the child\u2019s father incurred significant debts to take care of their \nchild. Her circumstances were compounded with her ex-husband\u2019s business failure in \n2009 and the lengthy period he was unemployed thereafter. Applicant was also \nunemployed for a period in 2011. After her divorce, she was left with a significant amount \nof debts and her ex-husband continued to be unemployed and unable to help support \ntheir children. It was not until February 2017, when Applicant obtained employment and \nstarted earning a significantly improved salary that she began to regain her financial \nstability. This mitigating condition is only partially applicable, though, because she did not \nundertake to begin repaying her debts, particularly her tax federal debts, until two years \nlater. Even with respect to her tax debt, she is only paying a very small fraction of her net \nmonthly income. It is important to note that she and her ex-husband have paid a state tax \ndebt, and she has paid the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In the context of the large \namount of federal taxes she owes and the significant amount of consumer debt that \nremains unpaid eight years later, it cannot be concluded that she has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant states that she has received credit \ncounseling. The only documentary evidence of that is her budget, which indicates a \nsubstantial net monthly remainder every month. While this evidence is praiseworthy, it \nraises a serious question as to why Applicant has not begun to pay more of her debts. If \nshe is relying upon her husband\u2019s promise in the Modification that he will pay them, then \nshe had an obligation to confirm that he was in fact paying the debts listed in the \nModification, which closely tracks the debts alleged in the SOR. She failed to do so. \nAbsent such confirmation or payments by Applicant of her considerable indebtedness, it \ncannot be concluded that there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant is \nengaged in a good-faith effort to repay her consumer debts. She acknowledges if her \nhusband does not pay them, then she is still responsible for the debts, with the exceptions \nof the debts assumed by her ex-husband in the court-approved Agreement. Moreover, to \n\n10 \n \nthe extent that she has made any efforts to pay her debts, those efforts post-date her \nsubmission of her SCA seeking a clearance, which undercuts the good-faith nature of \nsuch efforts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established with respect to Applicant\u2019s tax debts. She has entered \ninto an installment agreement with the IRS to pay $200 per month and has satisfied the \nterms of that agreement since March 2019. It might have been of greater mitigation value \nif she had undertaken this arrangement shortly after she joined her current employer, but \nthe fact remains that she has taken action consistent with the requirements of the IRS. It \nis also noteworthy that she has paid off her 2011 state tax liability with her ex-husband\u2019s \ncooperation. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment. I have given special \nconsideration to the very sympathetic circumstances that gave rise to Applicant\u2019s financial \nand tax problems. I have also weighed her responsible behavior with her current finances. \nI have considered the fact that two of the SOR debts are listed in the court-approved \nAgreement to be the responsibility of Applicant\u2019s ex-husband, which relieves Applicant of \nany legal responsibility for those debts. I have further considered her highly favorable \ncharacter references and employment evaluations. \n \n \nI have given some weight to Applicant\u2019s recent actions to begin paying her \nsubstantial federal tax debt and her payoff of her state tax debt. With respect to her \nconsumer debts, she continues to bear responsibility for tens of thousands of dollars of \nconsumer debt in the event her ex-husband fails to pay the debt pursuant to the terms of \nthe Modification. Specifically, she remains liable on six of the debts set forth in the SOR \nand has not undertaken any steps to repay them. The record contains little evidence that \nit is likely that her ex-husband will honor his obligations under the Modification. Applicant \nhas been unwilling to press him for details about his compliance with the terms of the \n\n11 \n \nModification, and she lacks any knowledge about her ex-husband\u2019s present ability to even \nmake payments on these debts. The record contains no basis on which I can conclude \nthat he is paying these very old debts or intends to pay them in the future. Also, the age \nof the debts suggests the possibility that the debts are or will become unenforceable due \nto state statute of limitations, which gives Applicant\u2019s ex-husband even less incentive to \npay these debts on her behalf. The failure to resolve debts due to their legal \nunenforceability does not mitigate security concerns under Guideline F.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. He is 53 years old. He is married and he has two adult children. He has owned his home since 2006. (Items 3-4). Applicant graduated from high school in 1984. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990. He was unemployed from January to March 2012 and January to June 2016, and self-employed from approximately November 2005 to December 2012. As of his March 2017 security clearance application (SCA), he worked as an engineer for a DOD contractor since June 2016. He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Items 4-5). The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 and 2011, as required. He listed and discussed his failure to file his 2010 and 2011 federal and state income tax returns on his 2017 SCA, during his April and June 2018 interviews with a background investigator, and in his January 2019 response to interrogatories. (Items 1, 3-6). Applicant attributed his failure to file his relevant income tax returns to the sale of his failing business in December 2011. He was overwhelmed with the associated record keeping and he was unable to provide his certified public accountant (CPA) with the information necessary to timely file his relevant tax returns. IRS account transcripts reflect that he was granted until October 2011 and October 2012, respectively, to file his 2010 and 2011 federal income tax returns, but he failed to do so.

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 18, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 11, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government submitted its written \ncase on April 26, 2019. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was \n\n \n2 \n \n \nprovided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM on May 2, 2019. He responded with documentation I have marked \ncollectively as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. The case was assigned to me on June 14, \n2019. The Government\u2019s documents identified as Items 1 through 6 and AE A are \nadmitted in evidence without objection.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. He is 53 years old. He is married \nand he has two adult children. He has owned his home since 2006. (Items 3-4). \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1984. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1990. He was unemployed from January to March 2012 and January to June 2016, and \nself-employed from approximately November 2005 to December 2012. As of his March \n2017 security clearance application (SCA), he worked as an engineer for a DOD \ncontractor since June 2016. He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Items 4-5). \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2010 and 2011, as required. He listed and discussed his failure to \nfile his 2010 and 2011 federal and state income tax returns on his 2017 SCA, during his \nApril and June 2018 interviews with a background investigator, and in his January 2019 \nresponse to interrogatories. (Items 1, 3-6). \n \n \nApplicant attributed his failure to file his relevant income tax returns to the sale of \nhis failing business in December 2011. He was overwhelmed with the associated record \nkeeping and he was unable to provide his certified public accountant (CPA) with the \ninformation necessary to timely file his relevant tax returns. IRS account transcripts \nreflect that he was granted until October 2011 and October 2012, respectively, to file his \n2010 and 2011 federal income tax returns, but he failed to do so. He indicated that he \npaid his income taxes quarterly then so he did not believe he owed any taxes, but \nacknowledged that he potentially faced penalties for failing to timely file. He also \nindicated that he was working with his CPA to resolve his unfiled tax returns. (Items 4-6; \nAE A).  \n \n \nIn his January 2019 response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that he timely \nfiled his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2017. He stated \nthat he did not owe any federal taxes for tax years 2012 through 2016 and he paid \n$4,266 in federal taxes that he owed for tax year 2017. He provided copies of IRS \naccount transcripts for tax periods 2012 through 2017 to corroborate his claim. He \nstated that he did not owe any state taxes for tax years 2012 to 2013, and he paid $351, \n$242, $1,280, and $1,975 in state taxes that he owed for tax years 2014 through 2017, \nrespectively. He stated that he understood the importance of filing his unfiled tax \nreturns, and he hoped his \u201cdemonstrated tax conformance since 2012\u201d and his \n\u201cwillingness to correct\u201d his unfiled returns would be considered. (Item 6). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2010 and 2011 federal and state income tax returns in May \n2019. His 2010 and 2011 federal and state income tax returns reflect that he is due \nfederal refunds of $3,374 and $621, and state refunds of $607 and $76, respectively. \nHe acknowledged that it was irresponsible of him to fail to timely file these relevant tax \nreturns and he should have corrected his failure sooner. He cited to his timely filing of \nhis federal and state tax returns for tax years prior to 2010 and subsequent to 2011 as \nevidence of his tax compliance. (AE A).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \n \nAG 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2010 and 2011 federal and state income tax \nreturns, as required. AG 19(c) and 19(f) apply.  \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG 20 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant filed his outstanding federal and state income tax returns for 2010 and \n2011 in May 2019. An applicant\u2019s eventual compliance with his tax obligations does \nnot end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax enforcement \nprocedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The fact that an applicant has filed his past-due tax returns does not \npreclude careful consideration of his security worthiness based on longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility. ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, \n2014). In addition, a person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, \nsuch as filing tax returns when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns was \nconfined to the two year period, in 2010 and 2011, when he was dealing with his failing \nbusiness. He acknowledged his error in failing to timely file these tax returns, and in \nfailing to file them sooner than he did. He does not have any other unfiled tax returns, \nand he does not have any outstanding tax obligation. He has complied with all of his tax \nresponsibilities since then. I find that AG 20(a) and 20(g) are established.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit 2.)  On December 19, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse.  The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on February 5, 2019. (Government \nExhibit 1.) She requested that her case be decided by an administrative judge on the \nwritten record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on \nFebruary 14, 2019.   A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining three Items, was received by Applicant on February 28, 2019.  She was \n\n \n2 \n \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not submit anything in \nresponse to the FORM within the 30-day period.  DOHA assigned the case to me on \nMay 28, 2019.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old.  She is unmarried and has no children.  She has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree.  She is employed by a defense contractor as an Administrative \nProfessional II.  She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n \nApplicant began working for a defense contractor in October 2017.  She has \nnever held a security clearance before.  From May 2005 to November 2017, Applicant \nused marijuana on a daily basis.  She states that she uses marijuana to treat her \nanxiety and mental disorders.  She also states that she no longer smokes marijuana on \na daily basis. She further states that she intends to continue using it to treat her anxiety \nand mental disorders if she is unable to get a prescribed medication that does not have \nnegative side effects.  She indicates that she will speak to her therapist about seeking \nother solutions than marijuana.  (Government Exhibit 3.) \n \n \nTo provide some background, Applicant suffers from manic depression, bipolar \nmood disorder, and panic disorder.  She self-treats her mental health disorders with \nmarijuana one time to two times weekly at present.  At some point, she was prescribed \nmedication by her therapist but that made her feel bad, so she stopped using her \nprescribed medication and went back to using marijuana.  Applicant indicates that she \nsmokes alone on the weekends when she does not have to drive.  She states that she \nwill only stop using marijuana if she is prescribed a medication that does not make her \nfeel bad.  Applicant has never incurred any financial difficulties as a result of her \nmarijuana use.  (Government Exhibit 3.)     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding sensitive position; and \n \n \n(g) continued drug involvement. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Applicant is new to the \ndefense industry and has never held a security clearance before.  She has a long \nhistory of marijuana use.  She has been self-treating her anxiety and mental health \ndisorders with marijuana for the past fourteen years.  Until two years ago, she used it on \na daily basis.  Now she uses it once or twice a week.  Marijuana is illegal under Federal \nlaw and is prohibited while holding a security clearance.  Applicant has chosen to \ncontinue using marijuana to treat her conditions instead of using a prescribed drug that \nmight have negative side effects.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s extended and frequent use of marijuana calls into question her \njudgment.  Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, reliability, and the \nability to abide by rules and regulations.  To be entrusted with the privilege of holding a \nsecurity clearance, one is expected to know and understand the rules and regulations \nthat apply to them, and to always abide by those rules.  Under the particular facts of this \ncase, Applicant plans to continue to use marijuana, knowing it is against Federal law to \ndo so.  Applicant is clearly is not eligible for access to classified information.        \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant has failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to demonstrate that she meets the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:, and 1.b. \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective \nJune 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2019, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. I was assigned the case on May 15, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 28, 2019, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 24, 2019. The Government offered \nexhibits (GE) 1-7, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, but offered no exhibits at the hearing. The record remained open until \nSeptember 27, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He offered \nexhibits (AE) A-D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 5, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations, except SOR \u00b6 1.j, with some explanation. \nThe admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings \nand evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since June \n2016. From December 2014 to May 2016, he worked as a DOD civilian employee. He \nworked for federal contractors from 2012 to 2014. He experienced unemployment from \nAugust to December 2011. He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force for 21 years, \nretiring in August 2011 in the grade of master sergeant (E-7). He is a college graduate. \nHe is divorced (married from 1991 to 2007) and has three adult children. (Tr. 6, 18-20; \nGE 1)  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in \nthe amount of approximately $1,625 for tax year 2017 and approximately $771 for \nunnamed tax years. It also alleged he owed on eight collection, charged off, and past-\ndue accounts totaling approximately $20,201. Applicant admitted in his October 2017 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), in his January 2019 statement to a defense \ninvestigator, and in his answer to the SOR that he failed to pay his 2015 and 2017 \nfederal income taxes. Credit reports from December 2017, June 2018, and May 2019 \nsupport the remaining delinquent debts. (GE 1, 3, 5-7) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to 2007. He claimed \nthose past situations were caused by his divorce in 2007. Concerning the financial \nproblems outlined in the SOR, Applicant attributes his difficulties to making a poor \nfinancial decision in 2014 when he bought an expensive car requiring monthly payments \nof approximately $1,100. He also admitted spending money on his girlfriend, which \nwould have been better served paying his debts. He noted that he paid back a debt to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) of approximately $7,000 when he failed two \ncourses for which his GI Bill paid. He also claimed that his income was reduced during \nthis time, and that he assumed the expenses associated with his mother\u2019s death and \nfuneral. No documentation supports these assertions. He provided no proof of seeking \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 22, 24, 33-34, 42) \n \n \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b (federal tax debt)-$1,625 and $771. Applicant owes these \namounts for the tax years 2015 and 2017. He claims he contacted the IRS to set up a \n\n \n3 \n \n \npayment plan online, but because his account has a freeze code, he was unable to \ncomplete the transaction. He documented his IRS online history showing his logins from \nApril 18, 2016, two on July 16, 2019, and two from September 20, 2019. He also \ndocumented that on September 20, 2019, he was unable to complete an online \npayment transaction. Applicant was given in excess of 60 days after the hearing to \nshow his actions to resolve these debts. He failed to document any payment \nagreements with the IRS or proof of payments toward the debts. These debts are \nunresolved. (Tr. 23-26; GE 3; AE D) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (utility debt)-$297. Applicant claimed this debt was for a utility at a \nformer residence. He claimed he called them. He failed to document any payment \nagreements or payments made. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 27; GE 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d (auto debt)-$1,638 (balance of $36,632). This is the car debt from \n2014. Applicant is behind on his payments. He failed to document any payment \nagreements or payments made. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 29; AE 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e (consumer debt)-$5,779. Applicant admitted this debt and claimed \nthat the creditors wished to settle with him, but he did not have the funds to do so. This \ndebt is unresolved. (Tr. 28; GE 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f (consumer debt)-$3,275. Applicant admitted this debt and claimed \nthat the creditors wished to settle with him, but he did not have the funds to do so. This \ndebt is unresolved. (Tr. 28; GE 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g (mortgage payment)-$4,817 (balance of $255,850). Applicant \nadmitted that he was behind on his home-mortgage payments. He claimed his credit \nunion is working with him and he adds extra funds when he can to his regular monthly \npayments. He failed to provide any supporting documentation. This debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. 30; GE 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h (consumer debt)-$432. Applicant admitted this debt. He failed to \nproduce evidence of payments or a payment plan. This debt is unresolved. (SOR \nAnswer; GE 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i (medical debt)-$219. Applicant admitted this was a medical debt for \nhis daughter that his ex-wife was to pay. He failed to produce evidence of payments or \na payment plan or anything documenting his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility for the debt. This \ndebt is unresolved. (Tr. 27-28; GE 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j (student loans)-$3,744 Applicant did not recognize this debt. He \ncontacted the school where he received his bachelor\u2019s degree and it provided a letter \nstating that Applicant had no outstanding financial aid accounts, including student loans. \nThis debt is resolved. (Tr. 32; AE B) \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant produced two character letters from his supervisor and a Navy officer. \nBoth describe Applicant as trustworthy and reliable. They recommend that he receive a \nsecurity clearance. (AEC). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has delinquent consumer debts and federal tax debt that remain unpaid \nor unresolved. I find all the disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. His reduced income and costs associated with his mother\u2019s death are \ncircumstances beyond his control. But he readily admitted that buying an expensive car \nin 2014 and spending large amounts of money on his girlfriend were not wise decisions. \nHe failed to take responsible actions to address his debts or timely pay his federal \ntaxes. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide documentation showing \nefforts to pay or settle any of the debts, except for the student loan debt (AG \u00b6 20(e) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 1.j). There is no evidence of financial counseling. There is no \ndocumentary evidence showing he made arrangements with the IRS to resolve his tax \nissues or pay his delinquent consumer debt. He failed to document his dispute of his \ndaughter\u2019s medical debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d), and 20(g) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his military service and \nhis civilian employment, but I also considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts \nand paying his federal taxes. Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nstability.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance because of his financial \nstatus. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

DOD CAF took this action under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective \nJune 8, 2017.  \n\n  \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 18, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nThe case was assigned to me on June 14, 2019. On July 19, 2019, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for September 11, 2019. \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel \noffered Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A.

After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He and his wife have been married for almost 30 years. \nThey have three grown children. Applicant graduated from high school in 1985. He has \ntaken some college courses, but has not earned a degree. He served on active duty in \nthe United States Air Force for 24 years, from September 1986 to October 2010, and \nwas honorably discharged as a master sergeant (E-7). He worked briefly in the defense \nindustry before entering federal civil service in March 2011. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31)  \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant began his current job as a technician with a defense \ncontractor and clearance sponsor. He works on an air force base as a technician. He \nhas held a security clearance for over 30 years, and is seeking to renew it. (Tr. 24, 37) \n \n \nDuring the 2010 tax year, Applicant was deployed overseas. His son was in \ncollege. Applicant initially did not list his son as a dependent on his federal tax return \nbecause his son initially intended to file his own tax return. His son later determined that \nhe did not make enough income to do that. Applicant did not file his 2010 tax return. \n(SCA; Tr. 20-22, 31-32) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed on his October 2016 SCA that his 2010 federal income tax \nreturn remained unfiled. In his September 2017 background interview, he voluntarily \ndisclosed that his 2016 federal income tax return was also unfiled. Applicant explained \nthat he used a nationally known tax preparation software program to prepare and file his \n2016 federal return. He thought he had done so in a timely way, but he was notified by \nthe software program that the return had not been accepted by the IRS. (GE 2) The \nreturns were also unfiled at the time Applicant responded to a November 2017 tax \ninterrogatory from DOD CAF. (GE 3)  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant documented that he filed his 2016 federal return in \nJanuary 2019, and received a small refund. He documented that he filed his 2010 \nfederal return in April 2019. He apparently would have received an $800 refund if the \n\n  \n3 \n \n \nreturn had not been so untimely. He does not owe any money to the IRS in past-due \ntaxes. (AE A) \n \n \nApplicant testified that by the time he revised his 2010 federal return after his son \ndecided not to file his own return, the filing deadline had passed. He initially intended to \nsend it in the next year (April 2012) but did not do so because by then he could not find \nall the relevant paperwork. He acknowledged that he did not do so out of laziness, and \ndid not file, figuring that he would just forgo any refund he was due. (Tr. 20-22) \n \n \nAs to his 2016 return, Applicant testified that after he moved to his new state, he \nhad difficulty preparing his return when he and his wife were living in different states. He \nprepared his return through the tax preparation software system, put in certain data \nfrom his prior year\u2019s tax return, but \u201cit got kicked back saying it was the wrong number.\u201d \n(Tr. 24) He said the same thing happened even after he contacted the IRS for proper \ninformation. He said he intended to file his 2016 return along with his 2017 return but \ndid not do so, again because of laziness. (Tr. 24-25) \n \n \nAE A includes account transcripts for several tax years, including 2010 (alleged), \n2012-2015 and 2018 (all filed on time), and 2016 (alleged). The account transcript for \n2017 is also included. It shows that Applicant also filed his 2017 federal tax return late, \nin April 2019. (AE A) This additional late-filed tax return is not alleged in the SOR, but \nmay be considered in weighing mitigation.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that receiving the SOR was what spurred him to \naddress his unfiled returns. He testified that he was not more prompt in doing so, in \npart, because \u201cI just put it off and I put it off.\u201d (Tr. 23) In 2016, he moved to his current \nhome state for his current job, and all his important papers were at his home, in another \nstate on the other side of the country, which impacted his ability to prepare his return. \n(Tr. 23-24)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his errors in judgment in not filing his tax returns more \npromptly. He accepted full responsibility and said the only reason he did not file his tax \nreturns is because he did not owe any taxes, and expected to get a refund. His view \nwas, \u201cif I don\u2019t get the money from them, then no harm done.\u201d (Tr. 26) He said if the tax \npreparation software had indicated that he owed taxes, he would have filed them. (Tr. \n35)  \n \nApplicant now has a greater understanding of the importance of filing a tax return \non time as required, particularly for those who seek eligibility for access to classified \ninformation by the federal government. He testified that he was remorseful and said it \nwill never let this happen again. (Tr. 26, 29, 37-38) All subsequent federal tax returns \nhave been filed. (AE A; Tr. 29). He lives in a state that has no state income tax, so filing \na state income tax return is not required. (Tr. 38)  \n \n\n  \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant loves his job, which is working on aircraft on an air force base. He \nsays, \u201cIt\u2019s all I know how to do and it\u2019s all I want to do, and I would love to do it another \n10, 15 years.\u201d (Tr. 26) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n  \n5 \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \n \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. Applicant had a duty to file his annual \nstate and Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, and the fact that he did not do \nso on two occasions is a security concern. As the Appeal Board has long held:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. As we have noted in the past, a \nclearance adjudication is not directed at collecting debts. By the same \ntoken, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information.  \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n  \n6 \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nFor two tax years, for two separate reasons, Applicant failed to file his federal tax \nreturns as required. For tax year 2010, Applicant waited to see if his son, then in \ncollege, would be filing his own return, or if Applicant should claim his son as a \ndependent. For tax year 2016, Applicant thought he had filed his returns through a tax \nself-preparation software program but was notified that his tax return was not accepted.  \n \n \nWhile the origins of these two late-filed returns are different, Applicant in both \ninstances failed to act responsibly in failing to file his federal returns on time and in \nfailing to cure the unfiled returns until several years later. By his own admission, he was \nspurred to act by the SOR.  \n \n \nIn weighing Applicant\u2019s good-faith efforts I must consider the timing of his \nactions. The Appeal Board has consistently held that timing of an applicant\u2019s resolution \nof his tax filing problems is relevant in evaluating mitigation. An applicant who resolves \nfinancial or tax problems only when his clearance might be imperiled raises questions \nabout his willingness to follow the sometimes complex rules governing classified \ninformation when his personal interests are not at stake. ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017).  \n \n \nIn addition, there is the matter of his 2017 federal income tax return, which \nApplicant also did not file until April 2019, contemporaneous with his efforts to cure the \ntwo late-filed returns alleged in the SOR. The 2017 return is not alleged, so I cannot \nconsider it as disqualifying conduct. However, the fact that Applicant failed to act \nresponsibly in addressing a third federal tax return, knowing that two returns were \nalready late and were already security concerns that he disclosed on his SCA and \ndiscussed in his interview, is a factor that significantly undercuts mitigation and \nrehabilitation efforts in this case. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax returns are now resolved, and he did not owe any \npast-due taxes, nor does he owe any now. AG \u00b6 20(g) therefore applies. But the case \ndoes not hinge on applicability of a single mitigating condition. In addition, the Appeal \n\n  \n7 \n \n \nBoard has held that an applicant cannot simply adopt a position of \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d or \n\u201call\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nWhile they are resolved, Applicant\u2019s tax issues are also recent and not isolated. \nThey evidence a continuing course of conduct that establishes a pattern of \nirresponsibility, failure to act, and, by Applicant\u2019s own admission, laziness, in addressing \nhis duties as a taxpayer that are particularly troubling given his profession. Given the \nnumber of tax years involved, and the fact that he waited until the SOR to take steps to \ncure the problem, Applicant did not establish that his issues with late-filed tax returns \nare unlikely to recur, and no longer cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I credit Applicant\u2019s long employment record in \nthe Air Force and in the defense industry, including over 30 years with a clearance. \nHowever, he has a pattern of financial irresponsibility with respect to filing his federal \nincome tax returns on time, as required. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the resulting financial security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nA Formal finding for or against Applicant on the sole allegation set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \n\n  \n8 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied \n            \n                             \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

He did not meet his burden to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 18, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Adjudicative Guideline F \n(financial considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 10, 2019, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 12, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 24, 2019, scheduling the hearing for \nOctober 1. 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter and exhibit list as Hearing Exhibits \n(HE) I and II. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, but submitted no exhibits.

He generally denied that he is financially \nirresponsible or lives beyond his means.  He is 51 years old. While he served in the \nUnited States Air Force Reserve from 1988 until 2012, he held a security clearance. He \nreceived an honorable discharge. In 1991, he obtained his undergraduate degree and in \n2015, he received his master\u2019s degree. He is married and has three children. Two of his \nchildren are young adults and the youngest lives with him. Applicant completed his \nlatest security clearance application in September 2017. He obtained a public trust \nposition in 2016. (GE 1) He has worked for his current employer as a teacher for about \none month earning $48,480. (Tr.16, 27) He is sponsored by his former employer for a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 16) \n \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d alleged failure to timely file Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2014, 2015, and 2017; delinquent federal tax debt in the amount of $19,776 \nfor tax year 2014; delinquent federal tax debt in the amount of $53,379 for tax year \n2015; and delinquent federal tax debt in the amount of $6,821 for tax year 2017. SOR \u00b6 \n1.e alleged an indebtedness for a state tax lien entered in January 2019 in the amount \nof $3,157; and the remaining allegations include five collection accounts for an \napproximate total of $109,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.i) Applicant admitted that there are \nfinancial issues of immediate concern and he and his wife are working diligently to get \nthings on track. (Answer)  \n \n \nApplicant explained that he was unemployed from January 2019 until August \n2019. (Tr. 19) At his last job, he was earning $38 an hour. (Tr. 19) He received \nunemployment benefits in the amount of $357 a week. (Tr. 33) He paid some household \nbills with this money and his wife paid the core of the bills. (Tr. 33) His wife earns an \nannual salary of $79,900. (Tr. 34) He was also unemployed in April 2015 to September \n2016. (GE 1) \n \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.d, Applicant attributed his failure to file the federal income tax \nreturns for 2014, 2015, and 2017 timely, in part due to his prior use of alcohol and a \nPTSD problem, which added strain to his marriage. He was candid in that his wife was \nreluctant to help him financially. (Tr. 37) He acknowledged that he paid some bills and \nlet the taxes be paid later. (Tr. 37) He has been dealing with his problem and is acting \n\n \n3 \n \nresponsibly. He understands that he has to work through his financial problems. His \nwife usually handled the money issues, as he was never that great with them. His \npaycheck is deposited to her account. She gives him certain amounts of money. He \nadmits that he owes about $80,000 to the Federal government for delinquent taxes. \n(Answer) \n \n \nApplicant explained that his wife usually filed the income tax returns as filing \njointly. However, for 2014, the income tax was filed in September 2015, and there was \nan account balance of $19,776 as of March 11, 2019. (GE 4) His wife filed jointly \nwithout telling Applicant that she claimed three exemptions and he filed jointly as well. \nNo taxes were paid to the IRS. He established an installment agreement in November \n2017 with the IRS, which ended March 2018 because new tax debt arose. That \nagreement or plan stops and a new one must begin with the IRS according to a tax \nconsultant. (Tr. 44) \n \n \nFor tax year 2015, the Federal income tax return was not filed until July 2, 2018 \nand a delinquent tax balance of $53,379 was owed as of March 11, 2019. (GE 4) \nApplicant thought his wife filed the income tax jointly as she usually does, but she only \nfiled for herself. (Tr. 48) He did not realize this until he contacted the IRS later in 2017. \nHis wife reportedly told Applicant that she filed separately for herself so that she could \nget a refund. He candidly stated that was an indication of the stress in the marriage \u2013no \ncommunication. (Tr. 49)  \n \n \nFor tax year 2017, delinquent taxes are $6,821. However, Applicant submitted a \nchart that shows the current amount is $7,482. (AE A) He explained that at the time he \nexperienced a reduction in force and lost his regular salary, which was about $138,000. \nHe was given a severance package of about $60,000, which was not taxed. (Tr. 52) He \nused the money to pay bills, but the money was gone by February 2016. (Tr. 52) He \nbelieved he would find another job soon but that did not occur. (Tr. 53) He filed the tax \nreturn in November 2018. (Tr. 54) Applicant again attributes this vexing situation to the \nwife\u2019s handling of the income tax filing separately instead of jointly, but he does not \nblame his wife for the situation. \n \n \nApplicant recently started a second payment plan (in process) with the IRS for \nthe delinquent tax debts for the years in question. He started the process with the IRS in \nJune 2018, but the payment plan was not approved, as he could not make the minimum \namount. (GE 5) He believes the minimum amount was $1,000. At this time, he \nsubmitted a chart showing his payment history from 2017 through 2019 for a total of \n$1,343 in payments. (AE B) At this time, Applicant has filed all his Federal income tax \nreturns for the years alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nSOR 1.e is the amount of a January 2019 state tax lien in the amount of $3,157. \n(GE 6) Applicant admits the lien and stated that he has contacted the appropriate state \noffice to enter a repayment plan. However, he believes that he owes the state $11,000 \nfor the year 2015. (Tr.63) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.f, Applicant admits that this is a delinquent debt to his \nundergraduate school, which he learned about from a collection agency. He made 18 \nmonthly payments of $125 on the account, but the payments ceased in October 2018. \nThe original amount was $52,070 and is now $48,395 according to the SOR. He \ncontacted the agency and learned that there is no record of the debt or why the \nautomatic payments stopped. (Attachment 1 with answer in file.) However, he filed for a \nscholastic academic transcript and that showed an amount of $23,000. (Tr. 67) He \ncould not receive an official transcript due to the amount that showed. (Tr. 68) \n \n \nSOR 1.g is a collection account in the amount of $10,500. This is related to a \ncredit card debt. He states that he is making monthly payments of $150.00. (Tr. 84, GE \n2, GE 4) \n  \n \nSOR 1.h is a student-loan debt-collection-account from the Department of \nEducation in the amount of $42,413. He stated at the hearing that he has not made any \npayments to date because he has no proof of this debt and he has been victimized in \nthe past. (GE 2) In addition, the student loan was being paid by his employer at that \ntime and the employer initially stated that they would pay the tuition. However, when the \ncontract ended and Applicant had no work, the employer stopped paying the tuition. \nApplicant stated that he never heard from anyone to collect any money. He contacted \nthe department in 2016 to initiate a payment arrangement but he never heard from \nthem. (GE 3) \n \n \nSOR 1.i is a collection account in the amount of $4,521. Applicant stated that this \ndebt was paid in full in 2016, in a sworn affidavit. (GE 2, 3) \n \n \nSOR 1.j is a debt in collection for the amount of $3,314. Applicant has made \nmonthly payments of $106.36. Applicant presented documentation that the current \nbalance is now $711.56. (AE D)  \n \n \nApplicant had a 2018 budget in the file when he was gainfully employed. He has \ntwo car notes and a mortgage loan for $1,265. He listed his payments to creditors \nincluding one on the SOR allegation. (GE 5) At this time, he and his wife share the \nhousehold expenses. (Tr.87) \n \n \nApplicant explained in his investigative interview in 2018 that he is seeking \nassistance from a credit counselor. (Tr. 83) His wife prepared the income taxes each \nyear and did not want to employ a professional tax preparer. (Tr. 65) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he has not been consistent with his financial affairs \nin the past. He did not file the taxes because he assumed his wife did but he did not \ncheck. He also thought that he would owe money and with the periods of \nunemployment, he did not have any money. He explained that if there was a tax liability, \nhis wife would not pay it.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his testimony and his credit reports, \nestablish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d), 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and 19(f) (\u201cfailure \nto file of fraudulently file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d) \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \n\n \n7 \n \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant admitted and his credit reports confirm that he has been indebted to \nthe Federal government for income taxes for an approximate total of $80,000. He failed \nto timely file his Federal income tax returns for 2014, 2015, and 2017.  He is in debt to \nthe state government for about $3,157 and owed on five collection accounts in the \namount of $109,000. The 2014, 2015, and 2017 Federal income tax returns have been \nfiled. AG 20(a) is not fully applicable because he does not have his finances under \ncontrol. \n \nApplicant had two long periods of unemployment and underemployment. He \ncandidly revealed that he had some personal issues that he has now addressed. Also, \nthere was a situation with his marriage in which his wife did not communicate whether \nshe filed the federal income tax return jointly or not. Applicant did not check on this \nsituation and was not aware until recently. These unforeseen events were all beyond his \ncontrol. To his credit, he did not blame his wife and accepted responsibility. AG\u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies, but he did not act responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n Applicant has filed his income taxes and had started a payment arrangement \nwith the IRS, but when he lost his jobs, he could no longer pay. He incurred new tax \ndebt. At this point he has started a new arrangement. He incurred other delinquent \ndebts by using credit cards to pay expenses and student debt. He recently filed his \nFederal income tax returns but still owes a significant sum of money in taxes. He began \nmaking some payments for the Federal debt in late 2018, but he still does not have a \npayment plan in place.  He has paid one or two small debts and he intends to pay all his \ndelinquent debts.  He experienced financial problems due to circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, but he did not establish that he acted responsibly in the wake of those \nunforeseen circumstances. Applicant\u2019s inaction regarding his taxes and his other debts \nprecludes a conclusion that his finances are mitigated. He did not receive credit \ncounseling. AG\u00b6 20 (c) does not apply. He submitted some receipts for payments or \nsettlement of some debts. Applicant has yet to address the state lien issue. AG\u00b6 20(d) \npartially applies. Due to the lack of evidence submitted by Applicant, it is impossible to \nconclude he made sufficient good-faith effort to resolve his debts or that his financial \nsituation is under control. AG \u00b6  20 (g) partially applies in this case. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant credibly testified at the hearing. He disclosed all his tax and financial \nissues on his security clearance application. He goes to work each day as a teacher \nmaking a much lower salary than he did as a contractor. He acknowledged his personal \nissues that probably affected good judgment. He and his wife did not communicate \nabout filing of income taxes. He accepts responsibility. He obtained two degrees and \nhad been paying or had his employer paying but that ended. When he lost his jobs, he \nhad to stop the IRS payment arrangements that he had for the income tax payments. \nHe has learned from his mistakes. He was passionate about the fact that he wanted to \nachieve something for himself. However, his judgment with respect to the filing and \npaying taxes provides doubts despite his intention and commitment to pay all his \ndelinquent debts. He has paid smaller debts. He is steadfast that he wants to pay his \ndebts, and showed that he is in earnest. He has paid or is paying on several and is in \nplace to pay his taxes. On balance, Applicant did not produce information sufficient to \nmitigate the security concerns about his finances.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with some questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance at this time. Because protection of the \ninterests of national security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining \ndoubts must be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.f and 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g,i. and 1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The record in this case \nclosed 16 April 2019, when Department Counsel stated no objection to Applicant\u2019s \nResponse.

He is a 37-year-old canine \nhandler employed by a U.S. defense contractor since July 2016 (Item 4). He served \nhonorably in the U.S. military from March 2001 to July 2014, when he was discharged in \npaygrade E-6. He seeks to retain the clearance which was most recently renewed in \nJuly 2014 (Item 3). \nApplicant married his first wife in May 2003. Their first child was born in \nSeptember 2003; their second child was born in June 2005. They divorced in May 2011. \nHe remarried in November 2011. He and his second wife have two children, born in \nNovember 2012 and March 2015. Applicant\u2019s second wife also remarried, although the \ndate of that marriage does not appear in the record. \nAs part of Applicant\u2019s May 2011 divorce, the court issued an Income Deduction \nOrder that required Applicant\u2019s present or subsequent employers to withhold $1,281.38 \nmonthly from Applicant\u2019s pay until Applicant\u2019s oldest child reached age 18 in 2021, and \na lesser amount until his second child reached age 18 (Answer). The military withheld \nthe require child support until Applicant\u2019s July 2014 discharge. \nSometime before April 2012. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and her new husband proposed \nto Applicant\u2014for a variety of reasons not relevant to this decision\u2014that the new \nhusband adopt Applicant\u2019s two children with his first wife. One expected consequence \nof the adoption would be to end Applicant\u2019s child support obligation. Applicant agreed to \nthe adoptions, signed the adoption papers (but did not keep copies of them), and as of \nJanuary 2013, had not received copies of the final adoption orders. The military \nwithholding of the child support ended with Applicant\u2019s July 2014 discharge. After his \ndischarge, Applicant had difficulty finding new employment, and experienced periods of \nunemployment. However, when he did have employment, he did not provide the child \nsupport order to the new employer, erroneously thinking that the adoptions had been \ncompleted (Item 4). \nApplicant asserts that he was unaware of his child support arrears until he was \nconfronted with them by a Government investigator during an August 2018 interview \n(Item 4). Nevertheless, he told the investigator that he would act to address the arrears. \nHowever, while Applicant\u2019s 5 March 2019 Answer claims that he immediately worked \nout a new budget, began making payments on the arrears, and had made all the \nrequired monthly payments to date, his Response shows that he made payments on 21 \nFebruary, 1 March, 19 March, 29 March, 12 April, and had submitted the payment for 26 \n3\nApril 2019 (Item 4). Applicant did not submit any court records to show the status of his\nchild support account. \n3The three banking documents appear to be from two different banking institutions, onlyone of which is clearly \nconnected to the child support order case number. The submitted records document six-seven payments of \n$650. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits (Items 1-4) substantiate, and Applicant \nadmits $61,565.06 in child support arrears. After he received the SOR, he made \n$3,900-4,500 in payments to the creditor. However, he documented no financial or \ncredit counseling, presented no budget, and he provided no work or character \nreferences, or any evidence of community involvement. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, \nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant stopped making his child \nsupport payments when he was discharged from the military in July 2014. His purported \nbelief that he was no longer responsible for child support because his ex-wife\u2019s new \nhusband had adopted the children is unreasonable, as Applicant failed to exercise due \ndiligence to ensure that the adoptions had been completed. Moreover, even if I \nconcluded that he reasonably believed that he no longer had a child support obligation \n4See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand first became aware of the arrears during a subject interview in August 2018, he took \nno action to address the arrears until after he received the SOR.5 \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. \nHis financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, although his financial situation may \nbe considered unlikely to recur. 6 Applicant\u2019s financial problems were not due to \ncircumstances beyond his control, but were due to Applicant deliberately ignoring his \nfinancial obligation and not ensuring that the adoption orders had been issued, and his \nchild support obligation ended. Moreover, Applicant did not deal responsibly with his \n7\ndelinquent debt when he allegedly first became aware of it. Applicant documented no\nefforts to contact the creditor until after he received the SOR, even though he became \naware of the arrears in August 2018. \nApplicant documented no financial or credit counseling, and his few payments \nmade after receiving the SOR are insufficient to demonstrate that the debt was being \n8\nresolved or under control. Similarly, the payments do not establish that he has made a\ngood-faith effort to address this debt. 9 Moreover, he provided no \u201cwhole person\u201d \nevidence upon which I might base a favorable result. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline F \nagainst Applicant.\n Formal Findings \nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 42, has never been married. She has three adult children. She received her GED in 1999. She took some college courses, without earning a degree, between August 2015 and August 2016. This is her first application for a security clearance. Applicant was employed in exclusively part-time positions from at least 2006 through June 2017. The record does not specify whether she was either unable or unwilling to work full time during that period. She had one period of unemployment, after being fired, from October 2016 through February 2017. She has been employed in a janitorial services position by a defense contractor since February 2017. She began working for them full time in June 2017. Applicant has 28 unresolved delinquent debts totaling $48,171, including three federal student loan accounts totaling $15,140 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.e), and 16 medical accounts totaling $13,050 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \u2013 1.o and 1.t \u2013 1.y). Without providing any corroborating documents, she disputed a $7,347 automobile loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.z) on the basis that it was not her account. That account is listed as an individual account on her credit report. (Item 5 at 11) Applicant engaged the services of a credit management company (Company A) in approximately October 2017 to assist her in resolving the debts alleged in the SOR. Company A advised her not to pay her creditors directly. In addition to debt settlement assistance, Company A offers budgeting information and credit educat",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 21, 2017. \nOn January 7, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 6, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On June 26, 2019, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6. She was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on July 1, 2019, \nand did not respond. Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3, 5, and 6 \n\n \n2 \n \nare admitted into evidence. Item 4 was admitted into evidence for the limited purpose \ndescribed in the procedural matter section below. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included a \ndocument that was marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The \ncase was assigned to me on October 3, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nThe Government included a summary of Applicant\u2019s security clearance interview \n(Item 4) among the evidentiary items in the FORM. It also included a prominent notice \nadvising Applicant of her right to object to the admissibility of Item 4 on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. The Government did not, \nhowever, advise Applicant of the consequences of her failure to raise an objection to \nItem 4 in her responses to the FORM: specifically, that she could be considered to have \nwaived any such objection; and that Item 4 could be considered as evidence in her \ncase. Applicant did not raise an objection to Item 4 in a FORM response or otherwise. \nHowever, because she was not advised that Item 4 could be considered as evidence \nabsent her objection, Item 4 is admitted only for the limited purpose of considering any \nmitigating or exculpatory information therein. I will not consider any disqualifying or \nderogatory information contained in Item 4 that is not corroborated by admissible \nevidence. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 42, has never been married. She has three adult children. She \nreceived her GED in 1999. She took some college courses, without earning a degree, \nbetween August 2015 and August 2016. This is her first application for a security \nclearance.  \n \nApplicant was employed in exclusively part-time positions from at least 2006 \nthrough June 2017. The record does not specify whether she was either unable or \nunwilling to work full time during that period. She had one period of unemployment, after \nbeing fired, from October 2016 through February 2017. She has been employed in a \njanitorial services position by a defense contractor since February 2017. She began \nworking for them full time in June 2017. \n \nApplicant has 28 unresolved delinquent debts totaling $48,171, including three \nfederal student loan accounts totaling $15,140 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.e), and 16 \nmedical accounts totaling $13,050 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \u2013 1.o and 1.t \u2013 1.y). Without providing \nany corroborating documents, she disputed a $7,347 automobile loan account (SOR \u00b6 \n1.z) on the basis that it was not her account. That account is listed as an individual \naccount on her credit report. (Item 5 at 11) \n \nApplicant engaged the services of a credit management company (Company A) \nin approximately October 2017 to assist her in resolving the debts alleged in the SOR. \nCompany A advised her not to pay her creditors directly. In addition to debt settlement \nassistance, Company A offers budgeting information and credit education services. \nHowever, the record did not specify whether Applicant availed herself of those \n\n \n3 \n \nadditional services. As of November 2017, her debt resolution plan also included going \nback to school to increase her earning potential and securing additional part-time work. \nHowever, the record did not specify whether she followed through with either option. \n(AE A; Item 4 at 5 and 9) \n \nApplicant \nattributed \nher \nfinancial \nindebtedness \nto \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment. She incurred some of her medical debt from a surgery she had at a \ntime when she was uninsured. As of November 2017, she was willing and able to pay \nher debts and had been living within her means. As of February 2019, without providing \nany corroborating documentation, Applicant proffered that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.x, 1.aa, and 1.bb were in various stages of Company A\u2019s settlement \nnegotiations process, and that she had a \u201cfinancial agreement\u201d in place for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y. (Item 2 at 5-7) \n \nThe Government identified in the FORM the areas in which Applicant failed to \nprovide documentary evidence to support her mitigation case. She was also advised of \nthe opportunity to submit that evidence in her FORM response. She did not respond to \nthe FORM. (FORM at 2-3) \n \n       Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n\n \n4 \n \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s significant unresolved delinquent debts, corroborated by the credit \nreports, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability \nto satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to establish the full application any \nof the following potentially applicable mitigating factors: AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment); AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances); AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts); \nand AG \u00b6 20 (e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue). Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her financial indebtedness.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried \nher burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.bb:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Henderson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n07/24/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn December 28, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nOn March 25, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on \nthe record. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 9, \n2019. Applicant received the FORM on June 10, 2019. Applicant had 30 days to submit \na response to the FORM. He timely submitted a response on June 24, 2019. The \nGovernment did not object to the information Applicant provided in his response to the \nFORM. On July 15, 2019, the FORM was forwarded to the Hearing Office and assigned \nto me on July 31, 2019. Based upon a review of the pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a DOD contractor since March 2016. He \nserved on active duty in the United States Air Force from July 2003 to June 2014. He \nreceived an honorable discharge. He was previously granted a security clearance in \nApril 2005. He has a high school diploma with some college credit. He is single and has \nno children. (Item 3) \n \nOn November 24, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing. (Item 2) A subsequent background investigation revealed \nApplicant had three delinquent debts. The debts include a past-due mortgage in the \namount of $59,035 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 1); a charged-off credit \ncard account in the amount of $9,959 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2); and a \ndelinquent utility account in the amount of $344 that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c: Item 4 at 4; Item 5 at 2). \n \nBetween June 2014 and August 2016, Applicant encountered several periods of \nunemployment or underemployment. After he separated from the U.S. Air Force, he \nwas unemployed from June 2014 to October 2014. He found employment in October \n2014, but was laid off in October 2015. He was unemployed until March 2016 when he \nwas hired by his current employer, however, he worked on a part-time status from \nMarch 2016 to August 2016.  Applicant relied on his savings to supplement his periods \nof unemployment or under-employment. He got behind on his mortgage payments and \nrelied on his credit card to pay expenses during this period. (Item 3)  \n \nApplicant applied for and ultimately received a mortgage loan modification, which \nwas approved on May 31, 2019. He successfully completed a Trial Period Plan from \nJanuary 2019 to March 2019. He timely paid monthly payments of $1,717.01 during the \ntrial period. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 1: Answer to SOR; Response to FORM).  He entered into \na repayment agreement with the collection agency for the credit card debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. He gave the collection agency signed checks for the amount of $373 each \nmonth starting in April 2019 to February 2020 in order to resolve the debt for $4,108. \nApplicant is making payments towards this debt. (Item 1)   \n \nThe $344 utility account was for the residence Applicant lived in at a previous \nduty station. He was not aware of this debt. He indicated that he paid the debt off in his \nAnswer to the SOR. He provided a confirmation number.  The debt is no longer listed on \nhis most recent credit report. SOR \u00b6 1.c is found for Applicant. (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 1; Item \n6). \n  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n\n \n4 \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAll of the above disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant incurred several \ndelinquent accounts after separating from the Air Force including a delinquent mortgage \non the brink of foreclosure, a delinquent credit card account, and a delinquent utility \naccount.  \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nThe concern under Financial Considerations is broader than the possibility that a \nperson might knowingly compromise classified information to obtain money or \nsomething else of value. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other important qualities.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raised \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \n\n \n5 \n \n \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were a result of his inability to find stable \nemployment for several years after he separated from active duty. He endured several \nperiods of unemployment or underemployment. Now that he is employed full-time, he \nhas been able to begin resolving his delinquent debts. He was able to have his \nmortgage loan modified and he is making payments towards his delinquent credit \naccount. There is sufficient proof that he paid the $344 delinquent utility account. \nApplicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts. The mitigating \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(c) apply. The security concerns raised about \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation are mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s employment history. I considered his 14 years of \nhonorable service in the U.S. Air Force.  Periods of unemployment and under-\nemployment had an adverse impact on his finances. Applicant has been employed full-\ntime since August 2016. He has worked to resolve his financial situation. The security \nconcerns raised under financial considerations are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a certified nursing assistant with her current employer since August 2013. A high school graduate in 1986 or 1987, Applicant received technical and professional certifications as a certified nursing assistant at various levels, as well as a phlebotomist from several community colleges during the 1990s. She has never served with the U.S. military. She was granted a secret clearance in 2011. Applicant was married in 1991. She has one son, born in 1986.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 25, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories. Applicant responded to those \ninterrogatories on November 13, 2018. On February 15, 2019, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto her, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n08/22/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated May 3, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on June 7, 2019, and she was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on June 14, 2019. \nApplicant responded to the FORM by timely submitting a statement and associated \ndocuments, all of which were accepted without objection. The case was assigned to me \non August 7, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly all, or \nparts thereof, of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., and 1.e. through 1.j.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a certified nursing assistant with her current employer since August 2013. A high \nschool graduate in 1986 or 1987, Applicant received technical and professional \ncertifications as a certified nursing assistant at various levels, as well as a phlebotomist \nfrom several community colleges during the 1990s. She has never served with the U.S. \nmilitary.  She was granted a secret clearance in 2011. Applicant was married in 1991.  \nShe has one son, born in 1986.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit \nReport, dated July 2, 2011); Item 7 (Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit Report, \ndated June 14, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 20, 2018); Item 9 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated November 7, 2017); Item 4 (Applicant\u2019s Response to \nthe Interrogatories, dated November 13, 2018; Item 1 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated \nMay 3, 2019); and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, dated July 11, 2019. \nApplicant was unemployed from June 2010 until March 2011, during which she \nreceived unemployment benefits. Her listed activities during that period were staying \nhome, eating lunch with friends, and window shopping. She did not indicate that she spent \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nany time searching for a job. (Item 9, at 4) Applicant attributed her financial problems to \nher husband\u2019s seasonal construction work for which there is not much work in the winter; \nher father-in-law\u2019s unspecified illness; her mother-in-law\u2019s Alzheimer's disease; and \nApplicant\u2019s own unspecified illness. She did not specify how those issues impacted her \nfinances. A review of her 2011 credit report reveals a significant number of past-due \naccounts from as far back as 2005; a state tax lien from 2010; and a federal tax lien from \n2011. (Item 8) Her more recent 2017 and 2018 credit reports reveal additional delinquent \naccounts. (Item 6; Item 7) Despite the plethora of delinquent accounts existing in 2017, \nwhen Applicant completed her May 2017 e-QIP, she denied having any delinquent \naccounts during the past seven years, essentially claiming that she was unaware of them. \n(Item 3, at 30-31; Item 9, at 8)  \nIn November 2017, during her interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant discussed her delinquent home mortgage; \nher state and federal tax liens; a judgment which she associated with a property tax issue; \nand some delinquent medical bills. Only after she was confronted with additional \ndelinquent accounts did she share the facts associated with those accounts. Applicant \nwas given five days by the OPM investigator to furnish documentation associated with \nher financial delinquencies, but the record is silent as to whether she complied with that \nrequest. (Item 9, at 8) She claimed that she is not unwilling or unable to satisfy her debts, \nand she contended that she had already made payments toward some accounts. She \ndisputed only one account discussed. She claimed to be meeting all of her current \nfinancial obligations. Applicant acknowledged that she had never sought financial \ncounseling. (Item 9) \nThe SOR alleged ten delinquent accounts totaling $48,364, with the largest such \ndebt \u2013 a federal tax lien \u2013 in the amount of $43,926. Six of the remaining accounts have \nunpaid balances of under $500. In her answers to the interrogatories, Applicant stated \nthat she had contacted several creditors and had started making payments. In her Answer \nto the SOR, Applicant repeatedly claimed that she either will start making payments soon, \nor this month, referring to May 2019. In her Response to the FORM, she repeated some \nof those promises, and she contended that she had already made some payments, paid \noff some of the creditors, or entered into repayment agreements with other creditors.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.:  With respect to the federal income tax lien that was filed in May 2011, \nattached to her answers to the interrogatories, Applicant submitted a Form 9465, \nInstallment Agreement Request, which was signed by her on November 10, 2018, and by \nher husband on November 20, 2018, offering to start making monthly $250 payments \ncommencing on December 20, 2018. She offered no indication that the request was \naccepted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The local court records indicate that, as \nof February 6, 2019, the unpaid balance of the lien remains approximately $43,926. (Item \n5) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant simply said that she was working on the account, \nwithout offering any additional information. Furthermore, as recently as her Response to \nthe FORM, Applicant conspicuously omitted any statement that the agreement had been \naccepted by the IRS or that she had made any such payments. In the absence of any \nother positive information, I must conclude that the account has not been resolved, and \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nthat little, if any, actions have taken place to indicate that it is in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.: This is an unspecified type of account with an unspecified creditor that \nwas transferred to a collection agent, for which a judgment was obtained in the amount \nof $1,006 in February 2013. Attached to her answers to the interrogatories, Applicant \nsubmitted documentation from the identified collection agent that had three separate \naccounts with different creditors with unpaid balances of $901, $1,349, and $2,118, all of \nwhich indicated that collection efforts had ceased and there was no further obligations \nregarding the accounts. Applicant did not submit any documentation to tie any of those \naccounts to the judgment in question. In her Answer to the FORM, Applicant stated that \nthe collection agent had informed her that the outstanding balance was approximately \n$907. She claimed that she would be \u201cmaking payments.\u201d Applicant did not state that any \npayments had already been made, and there is still no evidence to indicate that the \njudgment and the account to which Applicant claimed she was addressing were the same \naccount. In the absence of such documentation and payments, I must conclude that the \naccount has not yet entered the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account and a past-due and unpaid \nbalance of $597 that was charged off and sold or transferred to a collection agent. \nAttached to her answers to the interrogatories, Applicant submitted a statement that she \nhad entered into an agreement with the collection agent and that she had made the first \npartial bi-weekly payment of $34. She submitted a photocopy of the MoneyGram, dated \nNovember 12, 2018. In her Answer to the SOR, one year after the MoneyGram was \nissued, Applicant stated that she would be \u201cmaking payments soon.\u201d In her Response to \nthe FORM, Applicant claimed to be unable to reach anyone with the collection agent. In \nthe absence of an affirmative statement by Applicant that she had continued making her \nagreed payments, as well as documentation to indicate that payments had been made, I \nmust conclude that the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.: This is a clothing store charge account with an unpaid balance of $220 \nthat was placed for collection and charged off in 2016. In her Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant claimed that she had purchased merchandise but that it did not fit, so she \nreturned it. In her Response to the FORM, she stated that she will pay off the account \nwithin the next few weeks. In the absence of an affirmative statement by Applicant that \nshe had made any payments, as well as documentation to indicate that payments had \nbeen made, I must conclude that the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.i.: These are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of \n$680 (from 2012) and $235 (from 2016) that were placed for collection with the same \ncollection agent. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that she would begin \u201cmaking \npayments this month,\u201d referring to May 2019.  As recently as her Response to the FORM, \nApplicant conspicuously omitted any statement that she had made any payments on \neither account. In the absence of any positive information, I must conclude that the \naccounts have not been resolved, and that little, if any, actions have taken place to \nindicate that they are in the process of being resolved. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.g.: These are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of \n$434 (from 2012) and $276 (from 2012) that were placed for collection with the same \ncollection agent. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that she would begin \u201cmaking \npayments this month,\u201d referring to May 2019. She submitted a photocopy of the \nMoneyGram, dated July 11, 2019, indicating that she had made a $292 payment to the \ncollection agent for the larger of the two accounts. As recently as her Response to the \nFORM, Applicant conspicuously omitted any explanation with respect to the delay \nbetween May and July 2019 in making promised payments on the one account, or that \nshe had made any payments on the other account. In the absence of any further positive \ninformation, I must conclude that the larger account is in the process of being resolved, \nbut that the other account has not yet entered into that process. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.j.: These are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of \n$254 (from 2016) and $100 (from 2016) that were placed for collection with the same \ncollection agent. Attached to her answers to the interrogatories, Applicant submitted a \nphotocopy of MoneyGram for $50, dated November 12, 2018, which was applied to the \nlarger of the two accounts. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that she would \nbegin \u201cmaking payments [on the larger account] this month,\u201d and would \u201cpay off\u201d the \nsmaller account \u201cthis month,\u201d referring to May 2019. She submitted a photocopy of the \nMoneyGram, dated July 11, 2019, indicating that she had made a $254 payment to the \ncollection agent for both of the accounts. Since the combined balance for the two \naccounts was $354, and Applicant has paid $304 to date, it appears that the accounts \nare in the process of being resolved. \nDuring the security clearance review process, Applicant submitted statements and \ndocuments to indicate that she had resolved the state tax lien by garnishment in October \n2018; and was in the process of resolving a medical account with an unpaid balance of \napproximately $235 with a small payment of about $36 in October 2018, neither of which \nwas listed in the SOR.  There is little additional evidence that Applicant made any other \nefforts, much less good-faith efforts, to address her delinquent accounts, despite having \nmade promises that she would do so by May 2019. It is not known what Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial resources may be because she did not report her current net monthly \nincome; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available for \ndiscretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than she had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe SOR alleged ten delinquent accounts totaling $48,364, with the largest such \ndebt \u2013 a federal tax lien \u2013 in the amount of $43,926. Six of the remaining accounts have \nunpaid balances of under $500. Some of the accounts have been delinquent since 2011. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established, but there is no evidence that \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nApplicant has been unwilling to satisfy her debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)) The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and her failure to voluntarily and timely resolve her delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to \nremain unchanged, much like it has been for nearly the past decade. Applicant has \nattempted to attribute her financial problems to her husband\u2019s seasonal construction work \nfor which there is not much work in the winter; her father-in-law\u2019s unspecified illness; her \nmother-in-law\u2019s Alzheimer's disease; and Applicant\u2019s own unspecified illness. She did not \nspecify how those issues impacted her finances.  \n \nFurthermore, a review of her 2011 credit report reveals a significant number of \npast-due accounts from as far back as 2005; a state tax lien from 2010; and a federal tax \nlien from 2011. Her more recent 2017 and 2018 credit reports reveal additional delinquent \naccounts. The record is silent as to the reasons why the remaining debts were generated \nby her. Inaction or refusal to take timely and appropriate action with respect to the \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \naccounts she opened and used indicates irresponsibility toward financial and social \nobligations in general. When an individual with otherwise good credit, such as Applicant \nclaimed she was, fails to make timely account payments, her actions can be interpreted \nas a lack of respect for financial obligations. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, to date, there is evidence that Applicant took little good-\nfaith corrective actions with respect to her delinquent debts until well after she was \ninterviewed by the OPM investigator. Her state tax lien, an account that was not alleged \nin the SOR, was not resolved until the garnishment was completed in 2018. Other \ndelinquent accounts, one with an unpaid balance of $100 was not addressed until \nNovember 2018, and then again in July 2019. Making rare and isolated modest payments \non accounts that have been delinquent, in some instances, since 2012, does not \nconstitute good-faith corrective actions taken by Applicant. Her contentions regarding the \nstatus of some accounts, and her unverified comments claiming that she had taken \ncertain actions, without documents, such as an Installment Agreement Request that has \nbeen approved by the IRS, to support her claims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith \nactions. The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than she had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n(See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \ncertified nursing assistant with her current employer since August 2013. A high school \ngraduate, Applicant received technical and professional certifications as a certified nursing \nassistant at various levels, as well as a phlebotomist from several community colleges \nduring the 1990s. She was granted a secret clearance in 2011. Applicant made a few \nmodest payments on some of her delinquent accounts, generally in 2018 and 2019. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. The SOR alleged ten delinquent accounts totaling $48,364, with the largest \nsuch debt \u2013 a federal tax lien \u2013 in the amount of $43,926. She has repeatedly stated that \nshe had contacted several creditors and had started making payments, or that she will \nstart making payments soon, or in May 2019. She claimed that she had paid off some of \nthe creditors, or entered into repayment agreements with other creditors. With rare \nexceptions, because of her failure or refusal to submit documentation associated with her \ndelinquent accounts, such as receipts, cancelled checks, or bank account transactions, \nto support her contentions that any accounts have been settled, paid off, or otherwise \nresolved; that any agreed settlements have actually proceeded to resolution; or that \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \npayments have actually been made to her creditors, it is difficult to assess the true \nsituation, for we have only Applicant\u2019s unverified comments claiming that she had taken \ncertain actions.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that she took certain actions with respect to her \ndelinquent debts, there is very little documentary evidence to indicate that many of the \naccounts have been addressed. Despite efforts to have her furnish documentation to \nsupport her contentions, she has repeatedly ignored those requests. Her current track \nrecord is poor. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f., 1.h., and 1.j.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g. and 1.i.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n09/04/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on the record in this case,1 Applicant=s clearance is granted. \n \nOn 31 December 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline B, Foreign \nInfluence.2 Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a decision without hearing by \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in this case closed 17 \nMay 2019, when Applicant=s response to the FORM was due. Applicant provided no \nadditional documents. DOHA assigned the case to me 7 June 2019. \n                                                 \n1Consisting of the FORM, Items 1-4 and Official Notice (ON) items I-V (Item 5). \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective 8 \nJune 2017.  \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the Guideline B allegations, without explanation. She is a 43-\nyear-old employed by a defense contractor most recently since June 2018 (Item 4). When \nshe applied for a security clearance in June 2017 (Item 3), she was unemployed. \nPresumably, this was a pre-employment application, because, in July 2017, she went to \nwork for a defense contractor for whom she worked until September 2017, when she \nenlisted in a reserve component of the U.S. military (Item 4).3 She previously served on \nactive duty in a different branch of the U.S. military from August 2002 to October 2008, \nwhen she was honorably discharge in paygrade E-4. She has not previously held an \nindustrial clearance, but held a clearance during her time in the military (Item 3). \n \nApplicant was born in the Republic of the Philippines (RP) in January 1976. She \ngrew up and was educated there, obtaining her undergraduate degree in April 1999. In \nAugust 2000, she immigrated to the U.S., on an RP passport that would have expired in \nMay 2003, apparently on a fiancee visa.4 She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August \n2003, at which time she surrendered her RP passport. Her most recent U.S. passport \nwas issued in May 2012. She obtained an associate=s degree in a medical field in June \n2017. \n \nApplicant=s mother, a life-long homemaker, is a citizen of the RP, currently residing \nin the U.S. She immigrated to the U.S. in June 2017, where Applicant is sponsoring her \nfor U.S. citizenship. Applicant=s retired father, two older brothers, one younger brother, \nand one younger sister are resident citizens of the RP. Applicant has daily contact with \nher mother, annual contact with her father and one older brother, monthly contact with \nthe other older brother, and quarterly contact with her younger brother and sister. She is \nunaware of what her siblings do for a living. \n \nRepublic of the Philippines \n \nThe Republic of the Philippines is a multi-party, constitutional republic with a \nbicameral legislature. However, dynastic political families continue to monopolize elective \noffices at the national and local level. There is widespread official corruption and abuse \nof power. Authorities fail at times to maintain effective control over the security forces. \n                                                 \n3I assume this was the original sponsor of her clearance. It appears likely that her application remained \nactive after she left this employer because she enlisted in a reserve component of the U.S. military. \nNevertheless, her current defense contractor is listed as her sponsor for purposed of receiving DOHA \ncommunications. \n4I infer this from the fact that Applicant listed her approximate date of entry into the U.S. as August 2000, \nshe was first married four days after arriving in the U.S., and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen exactly three \nyears laterCapproximately a year after enlisting on active duty in the U.S. military. She divorced her first \nhusband in October 2004. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nSecurity forces commit human rights abuses to include extrajudicial killings and enforced \ndisappearances. \n \nOther human rights problems include allegations of prisoner and detainee torture \nand abuse by security forces; violence and harassment against human rights activists by \nlocal security forces; warrantless arrests; lengthy pretrial detentions; overcrowded and \ninadequate prison conditions; killings and harassment of journalists; violence against \nwomen; abuse and sexual exploitation of children; and trafficking in persons. The \ngovernment continues to investigate and prosecute only a limited number of reported \nhuman rights abuses, and concerns about impunity persist. \n \nLong-running Muslim separatists and communist insurgencies continue to result in \nthe displacement of civilians and the killing of soldiers and police in armed clashes. \nTerrorist organizations such as Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), Jemaah Islamiya (JI), and the \nNew People=s Army (NPA), as well as elements associated with the separatist Moro \nIslamic Liberation Front (MILF), continue to kill security forces, local government officials, \nand other civilians. Although Philippines counterterrorism efforts sustained pressure on \nterrorist organizations, its members are suspected to have carried out attacks against \ngovernment, public, and private facilities, primarily in the central and western areas of \nMindanao; others were linked to extortion operations in other parts of the country. \n \nU.S. citizens contemplating travel to the Philippines should carefully consider the \nrisks to their safety and security while there, including the risk of terrorism. \n \nNone of the source documents submitted by the Government reflects that the RP \nengages in economic or military intelligence activity directed toward the United States, or \nthat any of the terrorist groups operating in the RP seek protected U.S. information. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to be used to evaluate an applicant=s \nsuitability for a security clearance. Administrative judges must assess both disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances \npresented. Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the factors listed in AG & 2(a). The presence or absence of a disqualifying \nor mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, specific adjudicative \nguidelines should be followed where a case can be measured against them, as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant \nadjudicative guideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B by \ndemonstrating that Applicant has six immediate family members who are citizens of the \nRP, five of whom reside in the Philippines (SOR 1.a-1.c). Applicant=s contacts and \nconnections to the RP coupled with the terrorist threat bring AG && 7(a) and (b) into play. \nHowever, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant=s contacts wither her family in the RP would \nsubject her to a heightened risk of foreign influence or a personal conflict of interest. The \nRP is not known to engage in economic or military intelligence aimed at the United States. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant=s family has any connections to the RP government \nor military. In addition to her six years of honorable service in the U.S military, during \nwhich time she held a clearance, she has recently re-enlisted in a reserve component, \nwhich speaks to her dedication to U.S. interests. \n \nExamining Applicant=s circumstances, the Government=s evidence that there was \na potential heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion because of Applicant=s contacts with her family in the RP  has been overcome \nby Applicant=s connections to the U.S. Applicant has resided in the U.S. nearly 20 \nyearsCalmost half her life. She has served, and continues to serve, without incident in \nthe U.S. military. She has no financial interests in the RP. Her financial interests are all in \nthe U.S. She reported all her foreign connections as required. Her contacts with her family \nare routine, and not frequent with the exception of her mother, who now lives in the U.S. \nbeyond the reach of the RP. There is nothing in the circumstances of her other relatives \nbeing in the RP, or in Applicant=s contacts with them, to heighten the risk that she could \nbe impelled or compelled to provide protected information to the RP [AG, & 8(a), 8(b), \n8(e)]. I find Guideline B for Applicant. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5See, Department of the Navy v.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/26/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the decision of the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) that it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant her access to classified information. The DOD CAF \nalleges in its Statement of Reasons (SOR) that Applicant has a substantial number of \ndelinquent debts, totaling over $44,000. The record evidence supports a favorable \ndecision. Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is granted. \nHistory of the Case \nIn April 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) as a first-\ntime applicant for a clearance in connection with her employment with a federal \ncontractor. Following an investigation, the DOD CAF issued its SOR on December 12, \n2018, setting forth allegations under Guideline F (Financial Considerations.) Applicant \ntimely responded to the SOR and requested a decision based upon the administrative \n\n   2 \nrecord without a hearing before an administrative judge. She lives and works in the Middle \nEast. \nOn March 12, 2019, Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) with six government exhibits (GE) attached. Applicant received the FORM on \nMay 21, 2019, and submitted a response to the FORM on June 18, 2019, in which she \nprovided several additional documents. Absent any objection, all of the parties\u2019 \ndocumentary evidence is admitted into the record. On July 9, 2019, the case was \nassigned to me. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted 17 or the 19 SOR allegations. I have \nincorporated her admissions in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is \nextracted from her SCA, FORM Item 2, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical \ncitation to the record.  \nApplicant, 30, was born in Sudan and immigrated to the United States in 1999 with \nher family. She was ten years old at the time. She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in \n2005. Applicant was educated in the United States, receiving a high school diploma in \n2007 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2013.  \nApplicant struggled to find appropriate employment after her college graduation, \nbut in July 2014 she was hired by a company in Doha, Qatar, which provides staffing to \nU.S. companies contracting with the U.S. Government. In March 2017, she began in-\nprocessing with a new employer in the Middle East, which sponsored her to apply for a \nsecurity clearance. She submitted her SCA in April 2017.  \nDuring her unemployment and underemployment for over a year in 2013 and 2014, \nshe defaulted on a number of student loans and other debts. The SOR lists ten student \nloans that have been placed for collection. The total amount of those loans is alleged and \nadmitted by Applicant to be about $33,000. In addition, the SOR lists nine consumer debts \nwith a total amount of about $11,000. The record evidence supports the conclusion that \nsix of these consumer debts became delinquent in 2013 or early 2014 following \nApplicant\u2019s graduation. One of the other debts arose when Applicant\u2019s car was totaled in \n2016. Two other minor debts for mobile phone service are also more recent. (FORM Item \n3 at 4.)  \nThe details and current status of the 19 debts alleged in the SOR is as follows: \nTen Student Loans in Collection in the Total Amount of about $33,000 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a -1.g, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.m.) The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) guaranteed \nApplicant\u2019s ten defaulted loans and following Applicant\u2019s default, the DOE transferred the \nloans to a collection agency (Agency). In August 2018, she entered into a rehabilitation \n\n   3 \nprogram with the Agency under which she made six monthly payments of $119 on 17 \nfederally guaranteed student loans. She provided with her SOR response records from \nthe Agency evidencing her monthly payments from August 2018 through January 2019. \nThe amount of the payments was determined by her income. A separate letter from the \nAgency states that these payments are part of a loan rehabilitation program and that the \nnext step will be the formal consolidation of the loans with Applicant\u2019s student loan service \nprovider. The Agency official concludes her letter with the statement that Applicant \u201chas \ntaken the proper steps to move forward\u201d and complete the consolidation process. (SOR \nresponse.) \nAuto Loan Charged Off in the Amount of $2,942 (SOR \u00b6 1.h.) In December \n2015, Applicant bought a 2013 Toyota Corolla. She paid for the car, in part, with a car \nloan. At that time, Applicant was living in the Middle East. She signed a power of attorney \ngranting her sister the right to use the vehicle. In June 2016, a driver hit the Toyota \nresulting in a total loss of the car. The driver\u2019s insurance company paid part of the loss to \nthe creditor, but not all, leaving a balance of $2,942. In January 2019, Applicant\u2019s sister \nbrought a small claims court lawsuit against the driver. The court entered a judgment in \nMarch 2019 in favor of the defendant for unexplained reasons. Government Exhibit 6, \nwhich is a February 2019 credit report, reflects that Applicant remains liable for the \nbalance of the car loan in the amount alleged in the SOR, i.e., $2,942. Applicant\u2019s FORM \nresponse includes a June 2019 letter from the collection agency handling the account \nevidencing that she has agreed to make two payments of $1,177.50 by July 24, 2019, to \nsettle this debt. (SOR response; FORM response; GE 6 at 6) \nDelinquent Loan Owed to a Bank Charged Off in the Amount of $2,463 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.j) In November 2012, Applicant borrowed funds from a bank to help with her college \nexpenses. She defaulted on the loan in September 2013. Due to the age of the debt, it is \nno longer enforceable under the applicable state law. The debt remains on her February \n2019 credit report. (GE 6 at 7.) \nOther Non-Enforceable Charged-Off Debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. o, 1.p, 1.r.) These three \ndebts alleged in the SOR are owed to a department store ($698), a second department \nstore ($398), and a bank and its collection agency ($979). In her SOR response, Applicant \nwrote that she opened these accounts in 2013, but was unable to pay them due to her \nemployment difficulties. In her SCA, Applicant listed the bank debt and wrote that this \ndebt became delinquent in May 2015 when she was experiencing financial hardship. She \nbelieves that these debts are no longer enforceable due to the passage of time. The two \ndepartment store debts remain on her February 2019 credit report. Applicant provided \nwith her FORM response a March 2019 letter from one of the department stores \nconfirming that the store is \u201cno longer attempting to collect the remaining balance on this \naccount.\u201d (FORM response; SOR response; GE 6 at 6, 7.) \nBank Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Amount of $1,538 (SOR \u00b6 1.l.) \nApplicant opened this account in January 2011. Her last payment was made in December \n\n   4 \n2013, during her period of post-graduation unemployment and underemployment. In \nJanuary 2019, she negotiated a settlement payment of $615.59 to be paid on the same \ndate. She documented the settlement proposal, however, she did not document her \npayment. (FORM response; GE 4 at 14.) \nBank Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Amount of $1,025 (SOR \u00b6 1.n.) \nApplicant opened this account in February 2008. Her last payment was made in January \n2014. With her FORM Response, she provided a letter from the bank, dated February 5, \n2019, informing her that her account was closed with a zero balance. (GE 4 at 3; FORM \nresponse.) \nMobile Telephone Provider Account in Collection in the Amount of $435 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.q.) This account was referred to a collection account in April 2016. With her \nSOR response, Applicant provided an October 2018 letter from the collection agency \noffering to settle this debt for $225. The February 2019 credit report in the record reflects \na zero balance for this account. (SOR response; GE 6 at 1.) \nMobile Telephone Provider Account in Collection in the Amount of $623 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.s.) This account was referred to a collection agency in April 2017. With her \nFORM response, she provided a May 2019 letter from the collection agency reflecting its \nreceipt of payments in January 2019 or earlier in the total amount of $230.66 in settlement \nof this debt. (FORM response; GE 4 at 5.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n   5 \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n   6 \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR Answer and response to the FORM and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n   7 \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe debts of Applicant that are of primary importance from a security standpoint \nare the ten student loan debts alleged in the SOR. All of these debts became delinquent \na number of years ago after Applicant graduated from college and was unable to find \nappropriate employment. Six of the nine consumer debts also arose during this period for \nthe same reason. Though these 16 debts continued unaddressed for several years, \nApplicant\u2019s situation of being unable to pay her student loans and other college-era debts \noccurred some time ago and under circumstances that were unusual. The fact that four \ndebts are now unenforceable due to a state statute of limitations and that she has made \nno efforts to resolve these debts with payments is a concern. For the most part, however, \nshe has addressed her debts in a responsible manner making it unlikely that this behavior \nof a then-young college graduate will recur and these debts do not cast doubt upon her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. \nThe same analysis applies under AG \u00b6 20(b). The delinquent debts arose during \na period of unemployment and underemployment. Applicant began to pursue the \nrehabilitation of her student loans before the issuance of the SOR and is now about to \nhave them consolidated and can begin paying them on a regular monthly basis. Also, the \ndebt arising from the damage to her car was beyond her control, and she took responsible \nsteps to address her remaining obligation to the lender. She has also paid four of her \neight other delinquent consumer debts. She did not address the remaining four debts \nbecause she believed that they were considered resolved due to their unenforceability. \nOverall, she has acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \nestablished, most significantly with respect to her student loans, as to which she began \nthe six-month rehabilitation process before the issuance of the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has provided no evidence that she has \nreceived any credit counseling. All of her debt resolution actions have been taken on her \nown initiative. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established with respect to her student loans she has rehabilitated \nand are now to be consolidated and paid in the ordinary course under a payment \nschedule. Also, this mitigating condition has been established with respect to the two \ncredit card accounts and the two mobile phone accounts, which Applicant has resolved. \nShe has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay her creditors with valid, \nenforceable debts. There is no requirements that all of an applicant\u2019s debts be paid. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is partially established. Applicant disputes the current enforceability of \nthe four old debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.r. With respect to the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.o, she provided confirmation from the creditor that it was no longer pursuing \ncollection of the debt. This mitigating condition is not fully established, however, because \nthe fact that debts may no longer be enforceable is not considered mitigation of the \n\n   8 \nconcerns raised by the fact that Applicant allowed the debts to remain delinquent for an \nextended period of time. Also, a statute of limitations is not a bar that prevents a debtor \nfrom paying unenforceable debts. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: (1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nI have given consideration to the fact that Applicant was 24 years old at the time \nshe graduated from college and experienced employment difficulties for over a year, \nresulting in most of the debts alleged in the SOR becoming delinquent in 2013 and 2014. \nI have also considered her circumstances and personal history as an immigrant as a \nreason explaining her unemployment and underemployment at that time. The fact that \nthe best position she could find after a year or so of searching required her to work in the \nMiddle East, away from her family and friends, demonstrates the difficulties she \nexperienced following her college graduation and the aggressive steps she took to find \nemployment that could pay her living expenses and now her old debts. Based upon the \nmultiple steps she has taken to resolve her debts, I also conclude that it is unlikely she \nwill default on her student loans or again become delinquent on her debts. She has shown \nsignificant maturity by her efforts to resolve her debts while living outside the United \nStates. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nFor Applicant \n\n   9 \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant stated his older brother is a teacher who retired in 1991 as an officer in the Afghan military. He indicated his second oldest brother is a shop keeper who had performed his mandatory military service in 1990. He stated another brother is a captain in a police department. This brother did his mandatory military service prior to 1990. He stated that his youngest brother is employed by an Afghan agency and did not perform any military service. Applicant was the youngest in his family and did not have to complete mandatory Afghan military service because he was not 18 years old at the time.

The Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleges Applicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. \nAdditionally, he was terminated in 2015 from his job as a contract linguist.

Applicant testified, as reflected in \na transcript (Tr.) received on April 19, 2019. \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated his wife has a \u201cgreen card,\u201d (U.S. \nPermanent Resident Card), and both his children are U.S. citizens with U.S. passports. \nApplicant stated his older brother is a teacher who retired in 1991 as an officer in the \nAfghan military. He indicated his second oldest brother is a shop keeper who had \nperformed his mandatory military service in 1990. He stated another brother is a captain \nin a police department. This brother did his mandatory military service prior to 1990. He \nstated that his youngest brother is employed by an Afghan agency and did not perform \nany military service. Applicant was the youngest in his family and did not have to complete \nmandatory Afghan military service because he was not 18 years old at the time. (Tr. 20)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he stated his siblings, mother-in-law, and father-in-\nlaw are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. His father-in-law was a police officer before \nretiring in 1991. He stated his sister-in-law is an Afghan citizen living in the United States, \nand she has her permanent resident card. He stated he has provided support to his \nsiblings and sister-in-law between 2010 and 2015. He stated he gifted three properties \nhe owned to his siblings in 2008. He also admitted to being terminated from his job in \nJanuary 2015. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is a 44-year-old linguist who has worked for a defense contractor initially \nsince December 2005, with some interruptions. (Ex. 3, Tr. 16) From December 2005 \nthrough October 2008, Applicant first worked with U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. (Tr. \n16) While working for the U.S. military in Afghanistan he underwent required \ncounterintelligence-focused security screening interviews every six months. The results \nof the February 2010, March 2012, May 2014, and January 2017 interviews are contained \nin the record. (Exs. 4, 5, 6, and 7) As a combat linguist, he was in combat situations while \nworking with the U.S. military. (Ex. 4) In April 2019, he returned to Afghanistan as a \nlinguist.  \n\n \n3 \nApplicant believes it is an honor to work as a linguist for the U.S. military. (Tr. 62) \nHe believes his job \u201cis important because Soldiers cannot understand the culture or the \nlanguage. HIS job is to help the Soldiers understand what is going on in the country and \ntry to help the Afghan people understand the American Soldiers.\u201d (Ex. 4) He asserts his \nlove for the United States. (Tr. 62) If threatened or blackmailed by anyone, he would \ncontact authorities. (Ex. 4) He believes that anyone found guilty of espionage or treason \nagainst the United States should be put to death. (Ex. 4) He believes that it is important \nto protect U.S. secrets, because should someone learn of the secrets it could hurt people \nor result in an attack on bases. (Tr. 4) He believes strengthening the Afghan military and \npolice is important because, if they are strong, the Taliban will not try to attack anymore. \n(Tr. 4) What he likes about the United States is the education system; that there is little \nor no favoritism; the laws are implemented for every person equally; and, most \nimportantly, there is freedom where one can live however they want. (Ex. 4)  \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan. His wife is an Afghan citizen living in the United \nStates. His daughter, age five, was born in Afghanistan and his son, age three, was born \nin the United States. They live with their mother in the United States.  \nIn November 2008, Applicant came to the United States on a SIV (Special \nImmigrant Visa), which is a special visa for Iraqi and Afghan translators/interpreters who \nwere employed on behalf of the U.S. Government. (Ex. 4, Tr. 11) He wanted to come to \nthe United States because the United States \u201cis one of the great democratic country [sic] \nin the world.\u201d (Tr. 16) In December 2008, he received his Permanent Residence Card, \nand in April 2014, he obtained his U.S. citizenship. (Exs. 1, 4, 6, Tr. 10) \nIn primary school Applicant because very interested in learning English. (Tr. 64) \nHe was the youngest of his siblings and the only one to learn English. In 1992, a civil war \nstarted in Afghanistan when the Taliban took over. (Tr. 66) At that time, his father lost his \njob as a police officer and took his retirement. His father then worked as a bank clerk in \nthe payroll section of an Afghan ministry. (Ex. 4) In 1995, after graduating high school, \nApplicant and his four brothers immigrated to Iran as a refugees to avoid the Taliban \nregime. (Tr. 65) He was in Iran five years working in construction and in a factory. (Ex. 4, \nEx. 6) He was unable to participate in his father\u2019s funeral ceremony in Afghanistan when \nhis father died in 1998. (Tr. 66) In 2007, his mother died.  \nAfter the United States entered Afghanistan and attacked the Taliban and pushed \nthem out of the country, Applicant felt it was safe again to return to Afghanistan. (Ex, 4) \nAfter returning, while working at an Afghan ministry, he continued his English lessons. A \nco-worker told him that his brother was a linguist for the U.S. military and asked him if he \nwanted to become a linguist for the U.S. military. Applicant tested in three languages and \nbecame a linguist in December 2005. (Tr. 65)  \nIn October 2008, a month before first coming to the United States, Applicant \nmarried his wife in Afghanistan. Their marriage had been arranged by their families. (Tr. \n18) Following the wedding, his wife initially stayed in Afghanistan, with her parents who \nare citizens and residents of Afghanistan. (Tr. 44) It took two years and three months for \nhis spouse to obtain her U.S. Permanent Resident Card. (Tr. 21) She came to the United \n\n \n4 \nStates in March 2013. (Tr. 22) While Applicant was working in Afghanistan, his wife lived \nwith relatives in the United States until she obtained her green card. After obtaining her \ngreen card, she returned to Afghanistan to live with her parents. (Tr. 23)  \nIn March 2010, Applicant returned to Afghanistan as a linguist. He worked with the \nU.S. Marines in a remote, very dangerous area. (Tr. 11) He had to resign his job due to \na family problem. He needed to send his sister some support money and could not do it \nfrom his Afghan military base. (Tr. 19) His sister, living Afghanistan, had been a widow \nsince 2004 and was raising seven children. (Tr. 20) Over the years, he sent minor \namounts of money, $200 to $300, to his siblings on holidays to pay for holiday gifts, \npresents, food and treats for the holidays. (Ex. 3) He also sent a like amount of money to \nhis parents-in-law over the years for holiday gifts.  \nIn 2010, Applicant was back in the United States for a year before returning to \nAfghanistan as a U.S.-hired linguist. (Tr. 12) From August 2011 until January 2015, he \nworked as a linguist in Afghanistan, often in combat situations. (Ex. 4, Tr. 51) \nIn 2014, Applicant\u2019s wife and children were living in Afghanistan. In December \n2014, his daughter was very sick with vomiting and diarrhea and taken to the hospital. \n(Ex. 3) His daughter was in a very bad situation. The hospital was 1.2 miles from the \nmilitary compound where he worked. He left the compound for five or six hours to visit his \ndaughter. (Tr. 55) Normally he would have obtained prior approval and permission to \nleave the base, which was required by company policy and procedure, but he did not do \nso because it was an emergency. (Tr. 53) Additionally, he knew personnel were not \nauthorized to leave the installation for personal reasons. (Ex. 3) In January 2015, he was \nterminated from his position as a contract linguist for violation of company policy. He fully \ndiscussed the facts related to this incident in his September 2017 enhanced subject \ninterview. (Ex. 3)  \nFrom October 2017 to March 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife lived with her parents in \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 25) During that time, Applicant talked to his in-laws weekly. The frequent \ncommunication stopped in March 2019, when his wife returned with him to live in the \nUnited States. His wife will not be traveling to Afghanistan because she is now attending \ncollege and trying to get a job. Additionally, she is now more familiar with the United \nStates. (Tr. 25)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brothers and sister live in Afghanistan. He calls them on religious \nholidays to inquire about their health. (Tr. 12, 32) Applicant never served compulsory \nservice with the Afghan military due to his age. (Tr. 30) His oldest brother\u2019s compulsory \nservice ended in 1991 (Ex. 3) and this brother teaches seventh and eighth grade as an \nemployee of the Afghan government. (Tr. 30-31) This brother is married and has six \nchildren. The last time he saw this brother or any of his siblings in person was in January \n2015. (Tr. 33) Applicant has sporadically sent money in the amounts of $100 to $300 to \nhis siblings. (Tr. 33-34) He last sent money in 2017. (Tr. 25) In 2007, following his \nmother\u2019s death, Applicant and his siblings inherited their parents\u2019 property. (Ex. 3, Ex. 4, \nTr. 50) He received a one-sixth interest in farm land valued at $83,000. (Ex. 3) He \n\n \n5 \nreceived no income from the property and had no obligation on the property. In 2008, he \ngave his share of the property to his siblings.  \nApplicant has a brother who is a police officer employed by a department of the \nAfghan government. (Tr. 34) His brother is married and has a son and daughter. Another \nbrother is a shopkeeper who owns a dress store. (Tr. 36) His shop-owner brother is \nmarried and has one daughter and served his compulsory military service from 1996 to \n1988. (Ex. 3, Tr. 36) Applicant\u2019s fourth brother works is a statistician for an Afghan \ngovernmental entity. (Tr. 38) This brother has one daughter and two sons. His widowed \nsister has seven children. (Tr. 40) In the past, Applicant has sent her money to help meet \nher financial needs. All his siblings live in Afghanistan.  \nApplicant sponsored his wife and a nephew for immigration to the United States. \n(Tr. 42) His nephew came to the United States in 2013 seeking political asylum. (Ex. 3, \nTr. 42) His nephew, an engineer, has a work permit and lives and works in California. In \n1990 or 1991, his father-in-law retired as a policeman and his mother-in-law is a \nhousewife. (Ex. 3, Tr. 45) His father-in-law\u2019s most recent employment was that of a \ncommunications officer for an Afghan ministry. (Ex. 3, Tr. 47) His wife lived with her \nparents from October 2017 until just recently. (Tr. 46) While his wife was living with her \nparents, Applicant had weekly contact with his in-laws. (Ex. 3) His sister-in-law is a \npermanent U.S. resident living in the United States. (Tr. 47) Both his wife and sister-in-\nlaw plan on applying for U.S. citizenship as soon as they are able to do so. (Tr. 48) Three \nof his sister-in-laws live in Afghanistan, but he has minimal conduct with them. (Tr. 49) \nApplicant\u2019s wife intends to stay in the United States because she is now eligible to \napply for her citizenship. She is taking English classes and taking some college courses, \nand their daughter is starting kindergarten. (Tr. 58-59) In April 2019, Applicant started the \nprocess of purchasing his home in the United States. (Ex. B, Tr. 29) The purchase offer \nhas been accepted and the loan approved. (Tr. 29) In 2013, he had bought a home from \n2013 to 2016. He sold it in 2016 after his income from his linguist job ended in 2015. (Tr. \n78) \n \n \nAfghanistan is an independent country that is confronting the challenges posed by \ndecades of war, and an insurgency led by the Taliban and other insurgent groups. The \nterrorist threat posed by Al-Qa\u2019ida and others remains high. The United States is currently \nengaged in a mission to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al-Qa\u2019ida, and to prevent their \nreturn to Afghanistan. One of the main missions of the U.S., in helping the Afghan \ngovernment to secure its own borders and maintain internal order, is the training of an \nAfghan National Army. \n \n \nAfghanistan remains a dangerous country. The State Department warns U.S. \ncitizens of the possibility of terrorism and violent crime. It further warns U.S. citizens who \ntravel to Afghanistan to engage in business that they may become the target of threats, \nto include kidnapping. Serious human rights problems exist in Afghanistan. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \nCharacter References \n \n \nApplicant submitted 13 letters of appreciation, nine letters of recommendation, and \nother documents of training, all showing his outstanding duty performance. (Ex. A) In May \n2012, Applicant received two Certificates of Appreciation for exceptional dedication and \ndevotion to duty in support of the NATO Training Mission Afghanistan. (Ex A) He received \na Certificate of Appreciation for his dedication and support to the U.S. Army. He received \nnumerous other certificates of appreciation for his duty performance. A March 2007 Letter \nof Recommendation, from a U.S. Army major general, indicates that Applicant was one \nof the top translators serving with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The major general \nrecommends Applicant for special immigration status. A December 2014 Letter of \nRecommendation stated Applicant had provided dedicated service to Coalition members \nand provided exceptional linguist/translation service. (Ex. A)  \n \n \nThe file contains numerous other letters of support for Applicant\u2019s special \nimmigration application as an Afghan Interpreter/Translator due to Applicant\u2019s \noutstanding and invaluable services to the U.S. Army and Air Force. (Ex. A) One letter of \nrecommendation stated Applicant \u201cis among the finest citizens I\u2019ve met, in terms of work \nethic, loyalty and motivation for self [-] improvement. He actively pursues knowledge in \nthe face of personal hardship and displays great potential to strengthen US/Afghanistan \nrelations.\u201d (Ex. A) Applicant\u2019s special visa application was endorsed by two U.S. Army \nbrigadier generals. Applicant was presented a flag of the United States for his \u201cunfailing \nsupport of Operations ENDURING FREEDOM.\u201d (Ex. A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \n\n \n7 \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe foreign influence concern is set forth at AG \u00b6 6, as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial interests, and property interest, are a national security concern if \nthey result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they created circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise \nmade vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAssessment of foreign contacts and interest should consider country in \nwhich the foreign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe potentially conflicting loyalties raised by foreign contacts must be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of U.S. interests. \nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts in Afghanistan cause security concerns, I \nconsidered that Afghanistan and the United States have a relationship, which includes \nworking together on international security issues and trade. There is no evidence that the \nAfghan government targets U.S. citizens for protected information. Human rights issues \nin the Afghanistan continue to be a concern. While none of these considerations by \nthemselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be considered in determining \n\n \n8 \nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion because of his siblings and in-laws in \nAfghanistan. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n \nAn applicant\u2019s ties to a foreign country, through family members or others, can \nraise a foreign influence concern. Applicant\u2019s four brothers, sister, and in-laws are citizens \nand residents of Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections with his siblings and \nin-laws raise a heightened risk under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b). \n \n \nAt one time, Applicant had a one-sixth share in his parents\u2019 farm land after the \ndeath of his mother. He gave his share to his siblings and no longer owns any property in \nAfghanistan. He is buying a home for his family in the United States. Having had a prior \nownership interest in an inheritance at one time, which he no longer has, is not a \ndisqualifying concern. AG \u00b6 7(f) (\u201csubstantial business, financial, or property interests in \na foreign country, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal conflict \nof interest\u201d) does not apply. I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.g. \n \n \nAs for the foreign influence concerns raised by his foreign ties (See generally AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b)), Applicant clearly mitigated the concerns. He established the following \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.; \nand \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States., that the \n\n \n9 \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. His nephew and sister-in-law are permanent \nU.S. residents living in the United States. There is no security concern raised by these \nfamily members. I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.a.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. It must \nbe determined if these family relationships create a risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion by terrorists or would create a potential \nconflict of interest between his obligations to protect sensitive information and his desire \nto help his siblings or in-laws who may be threatened by terrorists.  \n \nIn determining if such a risk exists, Applicant\u2019s relationships and contacts with his \nfamily, as well as the activities of the government of Afghanistan and terrorist \norganizations within Afghanistan must be reviewed. The risk that an applicant could be \ntargeted for manipulation or induced into compromising classified information is real, not \ntheoretical. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his siblings and in-laws in Afghanistan raise a \nheightened risk and a security concern because of terrorists\u2019 activities in Afghanistan. The \nevidence of record fails to show that the Afghan government targets U.S. citizens in the \nUnited States or in Afghanistan by exploiting, manipulating, pressuring, or coercing them \nto obtain protected information. Thus, the concern that the Afghan Government will seek \nclassified information is moderate. The same cannot be said of the terrorists\u2019 \norganizations operating in Afghanistan, whose goals are to destroy or prevent the growth \nof a stable, central government in Afghanistan. \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother works for the Afghan government as a middle-school teacher. \nAnother brother is a police officer working for a ministry of Afghanistan\u2019s government. \nAnother brother is a statistician for the government. His fourth brother is a shopkeeper \nand his sister is unemployed. He last saw his siblings in person in January 2015. He has \nlimited contact with them. He contacts them twice a year during religious holidays. His \ncontacts and relationships with these family members present an acceptable security risk \nas his contacts with them are minimal and because of his professed strong allegiance \ntoward the United States. I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.b and c. \n \nAs previously stated, twice a year during religious holidays Applicant sends a minor \namount of money to his siblings and parents-in-laws for presents for their children and \nholiday gifts. He has done this for a number of years. The amount of money provided to \nhis siblings between 2010 and 2015 was minimal. I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.f.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his parents-in-laws was more frequent than his contact \nwith his siblings. When his wife lived with her parents, he would talk with his father-in-law \nand mother-in-law weekly. This communication stopped when Applicant\u2019s spouse moved \nto the United States. His father-in-law has not been a police officer in Afghanistan since \n1990 or 1991, which is more than 28 years ago. AG \u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. I find for \nApplicant as to SOR 1.d and 1.e. \n\n \n10 \n \nFurthermore, Applicant established that he would resolve any potential conflict in \nfavor of U.S. national interest. Security clearance adjudications are predicative \njudgments, where an applicant\u2019s past history is the best indicator of future conduct. The \nAppeal Board has held that: \n \nGenerally, an Applicant\u2019s statements, by themselves, as to what he would \ndo in the face of threats by a foreign government or entity are entitled to \nlittle weight. On the other hand, an applicant\u2019s proven record of action in \ndefense of the U.S. is very important and can lead to a favorable result for \nan applicant in a Guideline B case. In this case, Applicant has served the \nU.S. military as a translator in dangerous circumstances in Afghanistan and \nhas risked his life to protect American personnel there. (ISCR Case No. 07-\n00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). See also ISCR Case No. 06-25928 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, \n2006)). \n \n \nApplicant has again put himself in harm\u2019s way to help those he has come to see \nas his family, the U.S. service members that he has served with on and off on a daily \nbasis over the past 14 years. In light of his past history, Applicant\u2019s commitment to U.S. \ninterests is no hollow promise. Applicant provides support to the United States and to \nAfghanistan. He recognize the obligations he has to the United States. He is loyal to the \nUnited States and can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. Applicant mitigated the foreign influence concerns.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe personal conduct concern is set forth at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \nThe guideline notes a disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nunder AG \u00b6 16, and the following warrants discussion because of Applicant\u2019s employment \ntermination for failure to comply with company policy: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: \n\n \n11 \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information; \n \n \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer=s time \nor resources. \n \n \n AG \u00b617 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nIn December 2014, Applicant\u2019s daughter was in the hospital suffering from vomiting \nand diarrhea. The hospital was less than two miles away from his base in Afghanistan. \nHe knew he would not be authorized to leave the base for a personal reason such as \nvisiting his daughter in the hospital. He was gone less than six hours from the base to \nvisit his daughter. He was terminated from his position due to unprofessional conduct and \nviolation of company policy. Applicant fully discussed the incident resulting in his \ntermination during his September 2017 enhanced subject interview. \n \nThe factors leading to Applicant\u2019s termination are unlikely to be repeated since his \nwife and children now reside in the United States. It is unforeseen that he would again \nleave his base without proper authorization. It has been more than four years since his \ntermination. The event was not minor, but was an isolated occurrence since it only \noccurred once. This was the sole violation of company policy during his employment from \n2005 through 2015. It did happen under unique circumstances and does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Although he has not received \ncounseling, he fully disclosed the events leading up to his termination in his September \n2017 interview. AG \u00b6\u00b617 (c) and (d) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n12 \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guidelines B and E are incorporated in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old linguist who has worked for a defense contractor initially \nsince December 2005, with some interruptions. He is currently working as a linguist in \nAfghanistan. In his role as linguist he has seen combat. His military service in harm\u2019s way \nin support of the U.S. military merits considerable respect. He asserts his love for the \nUnited States He believes it is an honor to work as a linguist for the U.S. military. He \nbelieves his job is important to help U.S. military members understand the Afghan culture \nor the language and to help the Afghan people understand the American military.  \nApplicant\u2019s outstanding duty performance is evidenced by his numerous letters of \nappreciation and letters of recommendation. Supervisors have many tasks, especially \nthose serving in hostile environments, but two of the most important of their many tasks \nare: first, to accomplish the mission, and second, to evaluate those individuals assigned \nto them or working with them. Their character evaluations are important and often more \naccurate because they have observed applicants over longer periods of time and under \na variety of events and stresses, especially when in combat situations. These supervisors \nare required to evaluate individuals and describe their performance, trustworthiness, \nreliability, and dedication. I place a great deal of weight on the evaluations. The record \nincludes a recommendation from a major general and recommendations from two \nbrigadier generals, among numerous other recommendations. The major general stated \nApplicant was one of the top translators serving with U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and he \nrecommended him for special immigration status.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDoD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is whether Applicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws living in Afghanistan \nand his 2015 termination raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \n(See AG & 2(c)) Applicant has proven his fidelity to the nation and his trustworthiness. \n\n \n13 \nThese whole-person factors, in conjunction with the favorable matters noted above, fully \nmitigate the foreign influence and personal conduct concerns. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nforeign influence and personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Mark A. Myers, Esq. \n \n09/17/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns raised by his \n2015 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and his tax-related issues. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 14, 2017. \nOn March 8, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \nDOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, \n2006.  \n  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR April 3, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 18, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on May 16, 2019. On June 7, 2019, the Defense \n\n2 \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant\u2019s attorney that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 26, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called \none witness, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through N were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 8, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old systems administrator currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since April 2017. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997. He and his wife \nmarried in 1994 and have four children. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security \nclearance. (GX 1.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n2015; failed to file his 2013 through 2017 federal tax returns; is indebted to the federal \ngovernment for $7,832 for tax year 2011; and owes $34,910 for a federal tax lien entered \nagainst him in 2013. Applicant admits the bankruptcy, failing to file his taxes, and the \ndelinquent taxes owed for 2011. He denies the federal tax lien. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \nBefore 2013, Applicant and his wife were financially stable and able to support \ntheir family of six. In June 2013, Applicant\u2019s wife became the legal guardian of her then-\n10-year-old cousin after his stepmother died from an illness and his father entered \ninpatient treatment for drug abuse. Adding another person to the household, bringing the \ntotal to seven, caused increased financial strains on Applicant. Additionally, Applicant had \none daughter in college and Applicant\u2019s wife went back to school full time. Applicant \nbecame the sole financial provider for the household. Throughout their marriage, \nApplicant\u2019s wife was responsible for handling the family finances. During this period of \ngreater financial obligations, she overspent and \u201clet our finances get ahead of us.\u201d (Tr. \n72.) Upon learning of their overextended financial situation, Applicant met with an attorney \nwho advised him to file bankruptcy, which he did. He and his wife participated in financial \ncounseling and marriage counseling, in part, to prevent future financial crises. (Tr. 22-\n23.) \n \nBetween about 2009 and 2011, Applicant was working in another state. In about \n2015, Applicant was contacted by the IRS and informed that he had not been properly \ntaxed by his employer while working in another state and that he owed taxes for 2011. \nInitially, the IRS informed Applicant that the delinquent tax amount was $34,910, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant\u2019s attorney listed this amount in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition. However, Applicant subsequently disputed the amount claimed by \nthe IRS and the IRS recalculated the amount to $7,832 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (GX 2.) Applicant \nentered a repayment agreement with the IRS in January 2014, wherein $125 a month \nwas automatically debited from Applicant\u2019s bank account. As of July 1, 2019, the balance \nwas $4,519. However, the IRS applied a portion of Applicant\u2019s refund from tax year 2017 \nto this debt and it is now satisfied. (Tr. 35-36; GX 2; AX N; AX I; Tr. 28-30; Tr. 62-63.)  \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant and his wife did not timely file their income tax returns for 2013 through \n2017. The reason for this failure to timely file is twofold. First, Applicant\u2019s wife was \noperating under the erroneous idea that she had three years to file her tax returns if she \nwas owed a refund. Second, in attempting to use tax-preparation software, she entered \nher cousin\u2019s social security number to claim him as a dependent and the entry was \nrejected. Applicant\u2019s wife later discovered that her uncle had been claiming her cousin as \na dependent, despite the fact that Applicant\u2019s wife had legal custody of the child. (Tr. 35.) \nResolving this issue required that Applicant\u2019s wife manually complete the tax returns. \nBecause this process was time-consuming and difficult, and because she misunderstood \nthe filing requirements, Applicant\u2019s wife put off filing the returns. (Tr. 35-36; Tr. 85.) She \nhas since filed all of the returns. (AX A through AX H.) Applicant timely filed his 2018 tax \nreturn. (AX H.) Applicant does not owe any outstanding taxes. \n \nApplicant and his wife now share the responsibility of managing the household \nfinances. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s cousin no longer resides with them, and only their youngest \nchild remains in the household. (Tr. 64; Tr. 18.) Applicant does not have any current or \nrecent delinquent accounts and lives within his means. He is a committed and valued \nemployee who has received outstanding performance evaluations and multiple awards \nand recognitions. (AX K; AX L.) His coworkers highly recommend Applicant for a security \nclearance and characterize him as trustworthy, honest, and reliable. (AX M.) Applicant \nwas candid, sincere, and credible while testifying. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n4 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u2026. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n\n5 \n \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 19(a): \ninability to satisfy debts; AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and AG \n\u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose under unique circumstances and were due \nto conditions largely beyond his control. Specifically, Applicant unexpectedly became the \nsole financial provider for a household of seven, two of whom were attending college. \nApplicant\u2019s wife was responsible for managing the household finances and admits to \noverspending.  Upon learning of their financial situation, Applicant acted responsibly by \nseeking and following the advice of an attorney, and discharging his debts through the \nlegal remedy of Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant and his wife participated in financial \ncounseling. \n \n \nThe $7,832 owed for delinquent taxes for 2011 arose due to an error made by \nApplicant\u2019s employer. Upon learning of the delinquent taxes and the initial amount \nclaimed by the IRS (SOR \u00b6 1.d), Applicant disputed the amount. The IRS recalculated \n\n6 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) and Applicant entered a repayment plan in January 2014. The tax debt has \nnow been satisfied. \n \n \n \nWithin their household, it was Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s responsibility to file the tax returns. \nApplicant was unaware that his wife had not timely filed their returns for tax years 2013 \nthrough 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). After becoming aware of the late filings, Applicant insured that \nall of the returns were filed. Additionally, he timely filed his 2018 return. \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A trustworthiness adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues did not arise under circumstances that suggest \nreckless or irresponsible behavior. By participating in counseling, and sharing in the \nresponsibilities of managing the household finances, Applicant has taken proactive steps \nto ensure ongoing financial stability and to avoid future financial difficulties. He lives within \nhis means and has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(d) \nand 20(g) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his past financial issues. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact Applicant is 62 years old, and he was born in Iraq. In 1985, Applicant received bachelor\u2019s degrees in medicine and surgery from a Pakistani university. In 1989, he received a medical degree from an Iraqi university, and he received a master\u2019s degree in forensic medicine and pathology in 1991 from an Iraqi university. He married his wife in 1988, and they have two adult daughters. In 1997, he fled the Saddam Hussein regime and entered the United States through Turkey. Applicant, his wife, and children were naturalized in 2010. (Tr. 13-15, 22-26; GE 1; AE B) Applicant has been working in Jordan for a defense contractor since approximately February 2018 as a category I linguist and interpreter.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/11/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns raised by his foreign family members. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 1, 2017. On \nJanuary 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on March 8, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge (Answer). At that time, he was represented by counsel. On March 12, 2019, \nApplicant, through counsel, submitted an amended answer to the SOR (Amended \nAnswer). On May 14, 2019, Applicant\u2019s counsel withdrew his representation of Applicant. \n \nI was assigned to the case on June 27, 2019, and I issued an order to both parties \nto produce their documentary evidence by July 22, 2019. On July 8, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor August 6, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, were admitted without objection, \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nand Applicant testified. I received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 2019, and the \nrecord closed. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq. Those facts are set forth in the \nGovernment\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice for Iraq, marked as HE I. These \ndocuments are included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are limited to \nmatters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. Those facts \nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 62 years old, and he was born in Iraq. In 1985, Applicant received \nbachelor\u2019s degrees in medicine and surgery from a Pakistani university. In 1989, he \nreceived a medical degree from an Iraqi university, and he received a master\u2019s degree in \nforensic medicine and pathology in 1991 from an Iraqi university. He married his wife in \n1988, and they have two adult daughters. In 1997, he fled the Saddam Hussein regime \nand entered the United States through Turkey. Applicant, his wife, and children were \nnaturalized in 2010. (Tr. 13-15, 22-26; GE 1; AE B) \n \nApplicant has been working in Jordan for a defense contractor since approximately \nFebruary 2018 as a category I linguist and interpreter. He requires a clearance to become \na category II linguist. This is his second security clearance application. He previously \napplied for a security clearance in 2011, but his sponsor lost the government contract, \nand there was no final determination regarding his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 12-13, 27-30, \n34; GE 1) \n \nFrom 1985 until 1997, Applicant worked for the Iraqi Ministry of Health as a \nforensic-medicine and general-practice physician. He fled Iraq due to threats from \nSaddam Hussein\u2019s government. Three months after he entered the United States illegally, \nApplicant applied for political asylum. (Tr. 14, 22-26; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 1-2; GE 4 at 5) \n \n \nApplicant worked on behalf of defense contractors as a medical advisor and a \nmedical translator in Iraq during the following periods: August 2006 to February 2007; \nMarch 2007 to November 2007; December 2007 to June 2008; February 2008 to May \n2009; October 2010 to June 2011; and July 2011 to November 2011. While working in \nIraq he was in combat areas and subject to indirect fire. Applicant has not returned to Iraq \nfor personal reasons since he left in 1997, and he has not visited Iraq for any reason since \n2011. (Tr. 29-33, 39; GE 4 at 33-41) \n \n \n \n \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s four siblings are citizens and residents of Iraq. Additionally, \nhe has a brother who is a citizen of Iraq and a resident of Lebanon. During his August \n2017 interview, Applicant reported that he was estranged from his siblings because his \nfamily does not accept his wife. While he was working in Iraq between 2006 and 2011, \nhe saw only one of his siblings (Brother A). (Tr. 34; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 2) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nBrother A has been serving in the Iraqi military since 1983. He is a two-star general \nresponsible for coordinating the movement of Iraqi and U.S. forces. While Applicant was \nworking in Iraq, he worked with Brother A once every one or two months. Brother A is \naware that Applicant has been a linguist and translator for the U.S. military. Applicant \ntestified that his contact with Brother A, while he was in Iraq, was only related to their \nmilitary service and solely professional in nature. Applicant has not seen Brother A since \nhe left Iraq in 2011, and he has only communicated with him one time during a telephone \ncall in 2014. Applicant testified that he no longer gets along with Brother A to explain their \nlack of communication for the past five years. (Tr. 39, 47-51, 62-63; GE 2 at 8; GE 4 at \n14, 16-17, 45, 50)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Sister A and her husband are citizens and residents of Iraq. He last \nsaw her in 1997, and until 2014 he spoke to her two times a year via telephone. His last \ncontact with her was in 2014. Sister A is a housewife, her husband is a cargo shipper, \nand neither she nor her husband have an affiliation with the Iraqi government. (Tr. 53-55; \nGE 2 at 8-9; GE 4 at 47)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Sister B and her husband are citizens and residents of Iraq. She is \nemployed by the Iraqi Ministry of Education as an art professor, and her husband is an \nappliance dealer. Applicant last saw her in 1997, and he stopped communicating with her \nin 2011. (Tr. 55-57; GE 2 at 9; GE 4 at 47) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Sister C is now a citizen and resident of the United States. Her husband \nis a citizen of Iraq, and he moved from Lebanon to Iraq in 2017. He currently works with \nSister B\u2019s husband in his appliance store. (Tr. 57-60; GE 2 at 9; GE 4 at 45, 47)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, daughters, son-in-law, and two granddaughters are all citizens \nand residents of the United States. His mother and two of his sisters are also residents of \nthe United States. Since 2017, Applicant has managed the eight rental properties that his \nwife owns outright. Applicant and his wife have approximately 50% equity in their personal \nhome, which is worth about $700,000. He estimates that the collective equity in the rental \nhouses and their home is $1,000,000. They have approximately $45,000 in their savings \nand checking accounts. Applicant testified that he is involved in his community, and he is \nloyal to the United States. (Tr. 17-18, 26-27, 36-38, 41) \n \nApplicant provided certificates of appreciation and letters of recommendation. He \nis described as professional and dedicated. His level of medical and language expertise \nwas considered invaluable to the training of troops and the detection of detainee abuse. \nAdditionally, he submitted documents reflecting his completion of various DOD training \nin: antiterrorism; threat awareness; cyber awareness; information assurance; and joint \nstaff operations security. (AE A; AE C; AE E) \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nIraq  \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The outcome of the 2014 \nparliamentary elections generally met international standards of free and fair elections \nand led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to \nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi. (HE I)  \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous \nand the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. \ncitizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist \nand insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi \nsecurity forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens \nand western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)   \n  \n  \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include \npress, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. (HE I) \n   \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \n \n   \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nApplicant has ongoing familial connections with his three siblings and their families. \nAlthough his contact with these individuals has decreased over time, these relationships \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because of the risk \nof terrorism. The evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions are sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nApplicant\u2019s ties to the United States are substantial. His wife, children, \ngrandchildren, mother, and two sisters are citizens and residents of the United States. He \nhas significant financial assets and resources in the United States. Applicant testified that \nhe is a loyal citizen and his contact with his siblings and in-laws in Iraq is minimal. \nApplicant receives partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b) and 8(c). \n  \nApplicant\u2019s brother\u2019s position as two-star general in the Iraqi army, creates the \npotential for a conflict of interest. The instability and risk of terrorism in Iraq present an \nunacceptable risk that Applicant may be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of a foreign individual, group, or government and the interests of the United \nStates. Additionally Applicant\u2019s two sisters and his three brothers-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, including his character evidence and work in Iraq under \ndifficult circumstances, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns at issue. His \nbrother\u2019s position as a high-ranking Iraqi Army officer is significant and creates an undue \nrisk. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

(GE 1) According to his SOR response, \nhe separated from his spouse in 2017. (HE 3) \n \nIn 1984, Applicant joined the Air Force. (Tr. 17) He completed 23 years of Air Force \nservice, and he honorably retired as a master sergeant in 2007. (Tr. 25-26; AE A) His initial \nAir Force assignment was to security forces. (Tr. 24) From November 1999 to his \nretirement in April 2017, he served in various Air Force recruiting positions. (Tr. 25; AE A) \nHe received several recruiting awards. (Tr. 25; AE A) His highest Air Force award was a \nmeritorious service medal. (Tr. 102) He completed numerous training courses in the Air \nForce. (Tr. 17) He held a security clearance during his entire Air Force career. (Tr. 27) He \n\n \n3                                        \n \n \nhas not had any security violations. (Tr. 27-28) Additional details about his professional \nbackground are in his resume. (Tr. 28-30; AE A)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.c, 1.b, and 1.a alleges he filed bankruptcy in 2001, \n2010, 2017, and 2018. Applicant\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal \nsubject interview (PSI) took place on January 23, 2018. (GE 3) The bankruptcies will be \ndiscussed in chronological order.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2001. His \nnonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in November 2001. Applicant said his first \nspouse was committing adultery, spending excessively, and gambling. (Tr. 20-21, 35) He \nblamed his first spouse for mishandling the family finances while he was away from home \nfor training. (Tr. 76-77) His debts totaled $23,600. (GE4 at 8 of 8) Applicant agreed to take \nresponsibility for the family debts in the divorce; Applicant obtained custody of his son; and \nhis spouse agreed to pay $150 monthly in child support. (Tr. 20, 35, 83) He believed after \nthe divorce and his bankruptcy the creditors did not seek payment from his former spouse \nof their debts. (Tr. 85) Child care was expensive. (Tr. 34) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2010, and he \nclaimed $56,368 in nonpriority unsecured claims. His nonpriority unsecured debts were \ndischarged in October 2010. After Applicant retired from the Air Force in 2007, his income \nwas reduced because he was underemployed. (Tr. 35-38) His Air Force monthly base pay \nwas $4,142 (E-7 over 22 years). (2009 Military Pay Scale United States Military Service \nPay Information website, https://www.militaryfactory.com/pay-scales/2009-military-pay-\nscale.asp)  He also received $1,300 in housing allowance and $637 for rations and special \npay. (Tr. 69-71) His gross pay on active duty was about $73,000. He said he also had a \nperiod of unemployment. (Tr. 37) In 2007 and 2008, he earned about $52,000 to $54,000 \nannually. (Tr. 68) In 2009, his gross income was about $58,000 (about $38,000 from his \npost-retirement employment and about $20,000 in Air Force retirement pay). (Tr. 67; AE \nB) Before filing for bankruptcy, he said he attempted to use a debt consolidation and \npayment plan (DCPP) to resolve his debts. (Tr. 36) He terminated his participation in the \nDCPP because the DCPP used most of his payments for service charges, and Applicant \ndecided DCPP was not making sufficient progress resolving his debts. (Tr. 36)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2017. In June \n2018, this bankruptcy was dismissed for failure to make plan payments. In 2015, his \nannual income was about $74,000 ($54,000 from employment and $20,000 from his Air \nForce retirement). (GE 6 at 43 of 50) In 2016, Applicant\u2019s gross income was about $10,000 \nless and totaled $64,000 ($44,000 from employment and $20,000 from his Air Force \nretirement). (AE B; GE 6 at 43 of 50) Applicant changed employment, and he said his \nincome was reduced. (Tr. 39-40) His Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing indicates his monthly \ngross pay for the previous 10 months was $3,200 monthly; his retired pay was $1,600 \nmonthly; and his income from part-time employment was $390 monthly. (GE 6 at 37 of 50, \n38) His total gross income at the time he filed his Chapter 13 was $65,000. (GE 6 at 45 of \n50) He said he filed for Chapter 13 because he wanted to pay his debts. (Tr. 40) In April \n\n \n4                                        \n \n \n2017, he accepted employment with an annual pay of $53,000, an increase of about \n$10,000 in his gross pay from wages. (AE B; GE 6 at 43 of 50) It is unclear whether he \ndisclosed the $10,000 in increased income to the bankruptcy court. \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 filing indicates 20 claims totaling about $256,000 as follows: \nvehicle loan ($9,100); Internal Revenue Service (IRS) debt ($5,900); first mortgage debt \n($153,000); vehicle loan ($31,600); four credit union debts ($1,100; $2,500; $1,100; and \n$2,400); eight loans ($12,700; $6,100; $2,200; $6,600; $600; $1,300; $4,400; and $1,800); \ntwo telecommunications debts ($300 and $600); unspecified debt ($200); and credit card \ndebt ($2,500). (GE 6 at 11-18, 26 of 50) His monthly income was $5,457; his monthly \nexpenses were $2,058; and his debt owed to the government was $3,087. (GE 6 at 26 \nand 27 of 50) His first mortgage arrearage was $17,000, and his second mortgage \narrearage was $3,000. (GE 6 at 28 and 29 of 50) Prior to filing for bankruptcy in 2017, he \nborrowed five personal loans ranging from $14,600 to $2,400, and he said he thought he \ncould pay them back if he was able to secure better paying employment. (Tr. 83; GE 6 at \nto 32 and 35 of 50) He borrowed funds to help him make payments on other debts. (Tr. \n83) He conceded that his borrowing pattern showed \u201cbad decisions.\u201d (HE 3)  \n \nClaim 2 on Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy is an IRS claim for $5,900. (GE 6 at \n11 of 50) Elsewhere his bankruptcy filing indicates a federal tax debt of $3,100 which was \nincurred in 2015. (GE 6 at 26, 27, 30, and 36 of 50)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing shows he had $2,300 monthly available to \naddress his delinquent debts. (GE 6 at 48 of 50) His monthly Chapter 13 payment was \n$3,147. (GE 3 at 4) Applicant was in the Chapter 13 for 10 months, and he paid $22,097. \n(GE 6 at 48-50 of 50) His plan required him to make monthly payments for five years. (Tr. \n41) All of the payments were distributed to secured creditors. (GE 6 at 48-50 of 50) The \nIRS debt for $5,900 was unsecured and no payments to the IRS were made through his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy. (GE 6 at 48-50 of 50)   \n \nApplicant said he was unable to make the Chapter 13 monthly payments to the \ntrustee because he needed to pay $1,300 to fix his home air conditioner. (Tr. 41) He only \nhad $1,000 monthly remaining after making the bankruptcy payment to support himself \nand two daughters. (Tr. 41) His attorney suggested he \u201cflip\u201d the Chapter 13 and file for a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. (Tr. 41-42) Under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer \nProtection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), Applicant had to wait eight years from the original date \nof filing before he could file another Chapter 7. In this instance, he waited eight years and \none month to file after his 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy to file his 2018 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2018 and \nclaimed $64,102 in nonpriority unsecured claims. His nonpriority unsecured debts were \ndischarged in October 2018. He did not have any unemployment in 2018. (Tr. 78) His pay \nthroughout 2018 was consistent. (Tr. 79) His gross pay was $80,000. (GE 7 at 53 of 58) \nAt the time he filed for bankruptcy, he had a first mortgage of $155,000 and a second \nmortgage of $20,000. (Tr. 81) His mortgages were current evidently due to the payments \nof the Chapter 13 trustee. (Tr. 81) He owned two vehicles, and he surrendered both of \nthem. (Tr. 82) He did not list any priority unsecured debts on his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \n\n \n5                                        \n \n \n(GE 7 at 30 of 58) He indicated he anticipated a federal income tax refund for 2018 of \n$2,100. (GE 7 at 26 of 58) \n \nAround February 2016, Applicant purchased a new Toyota Camry, and he \nborrowed about $34,000. (Tr. 61; GE 6 at 29 of 50) When he filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, he owed $32,200 on his loan, and he assessed the value of the vehicle at \n$22,000. (GE 6 at 29 of 50) His monthly vehicle payment was about $600. (Tr. 55) He \ndecided to surrender the Camry, and he used the bankruptcy process to avoid paying the \nbalance owed to the creditor. (Tr. 55) About 10 days after his debts were discharged in his \n2018 bankruptcy, he bought a new Chevy Malibu. (Tr. 60) His monthly payment on the \nChevy Malibu loan is $520. (Tr. 54) He purchased the vehicle because he has a long \ncommute to work, and he needed a reliable vehicle. (Tr. 54-56)  \n \nApplicant received financial counseling as part of his bankruptcies, and after his \n2018 bankruptcy, he completed several financial courses. (Tr. 43-45, 73-74; AE O) He \nutilizes a budget to control his expenses. (Tr. 46) When he uses a credit card, he pays the \nbalance at the end of the month. (Tr. 53) He pays more than the monthly payment on his \ntwo vehicles. (Tr. 54) His annual gross income is $90,000, and he invests six percent of \nhis income in his 401(k) account (balance about $1,000). (Tr. 46, 52, 65; AE H; AE I) He \nalso invests in a Roth IRA account (balance about $3,500 increased by $1,200 from 12 \nmonths ago), and he pays his daughter\u2019s college tuition. (Tr. 46; AE H) He maintains a \nsavings account for emergencies. (Tr. 47) He has $2,777 available on a monthly basis for \ninvestments, emergencies, and savings. (Tr. 48-49; AE C) He has about $4,500 in his \nchecking account, and about $1,100 in his savings accounts. (Tr. 49-50; AE E; AE F) \n \nApplicant promised to maintain his financial responsibility in the future. (Tr. 59) He \nexpected his income to increase in the future, and he pledged that he would continue to \nensure his expenses were kept to a minimum. (Tr. 59-60)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n6                                        \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n7                                        \n \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n\n \n8                                        \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nBankruptcy does not necessarily equate to a good-faith effort to resolve financial \nproblems. See ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019). \u201c[T]he concept of \ngood faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). An Applicant must show that filing for bankruptcy \nwas necessary, prudent, and appropriate under all of the circumstances in order to mitigate \nsecurity concerns. See generally id. at 3-4. \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2001. His nonpriority unsecured \ndebts were discharged in November 2001. Applicant said his first spouse was spending \nexcessively and gambling. He blamed his first spouse for mishandling the family finances \nwhile he was away from home for training. Applicant provided an adequate explanation for \nseeking relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and SOR \u00b6 1.d is mitigated. \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy the second time less than nine years after \nhis first bankruptcy in May 2010, and he claimed $56,368 in nonpriority unsecured claims. \nHis nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in October 2010. After Applicant retired \nfrom the Air Force in 2007, his income was reduced because he was underemployed. His \ngross pay on active duty was about $73,000. He said he also had a period of \nunemployment. In 2007 and 2008, he earned about $52,000 to $54,000 annually. In 2009, \nhis gross income was about $60,000 (about $40,000 from his post-retirement employment \nand about $20,000 in Air Force retirement pay). Applicant\u2019s reduction in pay was an \nadequate explanation for seeking relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and SOR \n\u00b6 1.c is mitigated.  \n \nApplicant did not provide a persuasive good-faith explanation for why it was \nnecessary for him to file the Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2017. He indicated he was \nseparated from his second wife; however, he did not explain how the separation adversely \naffected his finances. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a strong indication that Applicant was \nshowing good faith in the resolution of his debts because he utilized this means to  pay \nhis creditors to the extent he was able to do so. As part of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy \n\n \n9                                        \n \n \nprocess, the Bankruptcy Court assessed his ability to pay his creditors and determined \nhis monthly payment.  \n \nThe U.S. Courts Website, http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/ \nbankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics, indicates: \n \nA chapter 13 bankruptcy is also called a wage earner\u2019s plan. It enables \nindividuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their \ndebts. Under this chapter, debtors propose a repayment plan to make \ninstallments to creditors over three to five years. If the debtor's current \nmonthly income is less than the applicable state median, the plan will be for \nthree years unless the court approves a longer period \u201cfor cause.\u201d (1) If the \ndebtor\u2019s current monthly income is greater than the applicable state median, \nthe plan generally must be for five years. In no case may a plan provide for \npayments over a period longer than five years. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(d). During \nthis time the law forbids creditors from starting or continuing collection \nefforts.  \n \n*  *  * \n \nFinally, chapter 13 acts like a consolidation loan under which the individual \nmakes the plan payments to a chapter 13 trustee who then distributes \npayments to creditors. Individuals will have no direct contact with creditors \nwhile under chapter 13 protection. \n \nApplicant failed to make the required payments, and his 2017 Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy was dismissed. He did not establish his good faith when he stopped making \npayments to the trustee. Applicant did not establish that he showed good faith when he \nconverted or flipped his Chapter 13 to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He did not take sufficient \naction to control his spending leading up to filing for bankruptcy in 2017.   \n \nApplicant took some important steps towards reestablishing his financial \nresponsibility after his OPM PSI but before the SOR was issued. There is no evidence of \ndelinquent debts after he received a discharge of his debts through bankruptcy in October \n2018. He received financial counseling, and he generated a budget. The Appeal Board \nhas stated: \n \n[T]he timing of ameliorative action is a factor which should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not threatened.  \n \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance and citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018)). \n  \n\n \n10                                        \n \n \nApplicant indicated he has a substantial remainder available to pay his debts, and \nhe did not prove that he was unable to establish payment plans and pay his debts in 2017 \nand 2018. He did not meet his burden of establishing that he acted reasonably and \nresponsibly in regard to his finances. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old software test engineer and information technology \nspecialist employed by a defense contractors since August 2012. In 2013, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant completed 23 years of Air Force service, and he honorably \nretired as a master sergeant in 2007. His highest Air Force award was a meritorious \nservice medal. He completed numerous training courses in the Air Force. He held a \nsecurity clearance during his entire Air Force career. He has not had any security \nviolations.   \n \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. Circumstances \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control harmed his finances, and it was reasonable for him to obtain \nbankruptcy discharges of his debts in 2001 and 2010. This enabled him to obtain a fresh \nfinancial start. After he obtained the bankruptcy discharge in October 2018, he did not \ngenerate any new delinquent debt. He received financial counseling, and he generated a \nbudget. \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant spent and borrowed \nexcessively leading up to his filing his Chapter 13 wage earner\u2019s plan. His two mortgages \nwere behind about $20,000 in 2017. Before he filed for bankruptcy in 2017, he was \nborrowing and then using the proceeds to pay other personal loans. His debts were \n\n \n11                                        \n \n \ngenerated through excessive spending. It was not prudent to borrow with the expectation \nthat he would obtain better-paying employment. He did not establish his good faith when \nhe failed to complete the Chapter 13 payment plan. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations [indicates his] poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \n[his] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is \nnot warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:    \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant has significant unpaid debts. Based upon the record as a \nwhole, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960); DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), \nas amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), \nfor all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 25, 2019, admitting two of the three \nSOR allegations and providing a lengthy statement in mitigation about each allegation. \nHe requested a hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). On July 17, 2019, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on September 6, 2019, scheduling the hearing on September 26, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered five \ndocuments, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. The Government\u2019s \nexhibits were admitted into the record without objection. I marked Department Counsel\u2019s \nExhibit List as Hearing Exhibit 1. Applicant offered no documents at the hearing. I left the \nrecord open until October 10, 2019, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit \ndocumentary evidence in support of his case. On September 29, 2019, he submitted one \ndocument, which I have marked and admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) \nA. On October 2 and 4, 2019, Applicant wrote two emails, which I have marked as Hearing \nExhibit 2. I have included the information in his emails regarding the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c as evidence to be included in the record. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nOctober 11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response in the findings of \nfact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 1, his security clearance \napplication (SCA), dated April 20, 2017, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical \ncitation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record \nevidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 49, has worked for a U.S. Government contractor as an engineer since \n2013. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1992 to 2000 and deployed on two occasions, \nonce to the United Kingdom and once to Saudi Arabia. He held a top secret clearance \nthroughout his military service and was granted eligibility for access to sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI) in 1999 as part of his duties during Operation Desert \nShield. (GE 5 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant has been married since 1993. He and his wife have three children, ages \n22 to 24. In 1992, he earned a high school diploma. He reports no unemployment during \nthe last 15 years.  \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant and his family moved to State 1 where they presently reside. In \nNovember 2005, he and his wife purchased House 1 for $360,000 with a $100,000 cash \ndown payment and the balanced financed with a first mortgage. In 2007, they purchased \nHouse 2 for $620,000, all of which was financed with a first mortgage, and moved into \nthat house while renting House 1. Shortly thereafter, their oldest child became seriously \nill. She was treated in their local city for about 18 months at which time she became even \nsicker. After much research, Applicant and his wife determined that their daughter\u2019s best \nchances for survival was to be treated at a hospital in State 2. Applicant relocated his \nfamily to State 2 so that his child could be treated there. They put both houses on the \n\n3 \n \nmarket to sell, but the housing market crash made that difficult. In 2008, they successfully \nsold House 2 in a short sale for $425,000. They rented House 1 for a period. (Tr. 17-22, \n27.) \n \n \nIn about November 2009, the treatment of Applicant\u2019s daughter was completed, \nand he moved his family back to State 1. They lived in House 1 until November 2010. At \nthat time, he and his wife bought House 3, paying $245,000. They rented House 1 again, \nbut the tenants vacated sometime thereafter. (Tr. 23-35.) \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant had also taken out a Home Equity Line of Credit or \nHELOC secured by House 1 with a debt of about $145,000. He primarily used the \nproceeds of that loan to make improvements to House 1. In 2011, the mortgage on the \nhouse 1 was about $218,000 and it was worth about $200,000. He had a significant \nnegative equity in the property. He was advised by a friend who was a realtor to let the \nhouse go to foreclosure. Applicant agreed and stopped paying his mortgage and the \nHELOC. In 2012, the mortgage holder foreclosed due to the defaulted loan. Following the \nforeclosure, the first mortgage bank accepted the proceeds of the sale, and the HELOC \nlender received nothing. Under the terms of the HELOC, the lender converted the HELOC \ninto a personal loan on which Applicant remained liable in the full amount of the debt. This \ndebt is the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 23-35.) \n \n \nAfter the foreclosure, Applicant began to again pay the former HELOC debt until \n2015. His realtor friend advised him that the lender would not negotiate a settlement with \nhim as long as he continued to pay the loan every month, so Applicant stopped paying \nthe monthly charge of $288. He choose to do this even though he had the financial ability \nto continue to pay the loan. He made attempts to negotiate a settlement with the lender \nwith discussions over the phone for another two years. At one point, he offered to pay \n$24,000. He also testified that he offered to pay $60,000 in 2017, but the lender never \nresponded. Instead, the lender issued a FORM 1099-C at the end of the year cancelling \nthe entire debt in the amount of 147,982, which included $2,200 of unpaid interest. Due \nto a tax exclusion, he was not obligated to pay taxes on the cancelled debt. Applicant has \nno plans to take any further steps to pay this debt, notwithstanding his current annual \nincome of $150,000 to $170,000. (Tr. 36-40, 45-46, 51.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off account held by a retail-store, credit-card bank in \nthe amount of $3,237. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted this debt. This debt arose \nout of Applicant\u2019s purchase of a TV for $1,800 in 2009. The purchase was made on credit. \nBoth of the Government\u2019s credit reports for Applicant in the record reflect that the debt is \nin collection. Applicant claims that he set up online an automatic payment of $75 per \nmonth to be paid out of his debit card. His payments stopped at some point, which \nApplicant blamed on his debit card expiring in about 2011. The debt was turned over to a \ncollection agency, and it demanded payment in the amount of $2,800. Applicant believed \nhe had paid the debt down to about $600. He disputed the debt with the collection agency \nand demanded documentation from the collection agency to establish the amount of the \ndebt, which he testified was never provided. He has had no further contact with anyone \nabout the debt, and it remains unpaid. (Tr. 46-48, 55-56; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 1.) \n\n4 \n \n \nSOR 1.c alleges an account owed to a collection agency in the amount of $108. \nApplicant denied this debt in his SOR response. The debt arose after Applicant cancelled \nhis Internet service in December 2014 and did not return the modem to the service \nprovider. In his background interview, he told the investigator that the collection agency \noffered to call the service provider to ask if it would accept the return of the modem in lieu \nof a payment. He said that he never heard further about the matter and plans to do nothing \nbut wait until the collection agency calls or writes him. At the hearing, he testified simply \nthat the matter was resolved, though he said he had no proof of the resolution. He \nbelieves the matter is resolved because the debt does not appear on his credit report. He \ndid not offer the credit report into evidence. The debt does not appear in either of the two \nmore recent credit reports introduced by the Government. It is the subject of a discussion \nin Applicant\u2019s background interview, which indicates that the debt appeared in the credit \nreport in the possession of the government interviewer at the time. In an email dated \nOctober 4, 2019, Applicant advised that he just paid the Internet service provider $111 to \nresolve this debt. (Tr. 48-49; GE 2 at 4-5; Hearing Ex 2 at 1-2.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n\n5 \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response and testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under \n\n6 \n \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d).   \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debts which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 20(a) have been partially established. \nThe foreclosure on House 1 occurred a number of years ago. His non-payment of his \ndebt arising from the foreclosure of the HELOC occurred in 2015, which is not that long \nago. Applicant\u2019s choice not to pay this debt was a strategic decision he made in the hopes \nof negotiating a better deal than paying the balance of the loan at the rate of $288 per \nmonth or whatever larger amount he decided. With his substantial income, the loan could \nhave easily been paid off in due course. The fact that his lender eventually cancelled the \ndebt undercuts any argument that this sort of behavior is unlikely to recur in the future. \nHis inactions on addressing the TV purchase credit debt and the Internet modem debt \nsupport this conclusion. Moreover, his behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has not been established for the reasons set forth above in the \ndiscussion regarding AG \u00b6 20(a). The conditions that resulted in the financial problem \nwere within Applicant\u2019s control. Also, he failed to act responsibly under the circumstances. \nOn three occasions, he ignored his indebtedness in the hopes that the creditors would \nnot pursue him. His approach proved to be in his best financial interests, but they do not \n\n7 \n \nreflect that he is someone who keeps his promises when he is extended credit. Applicant\u2019s \nestablished pattern of behavior raises questions about his trustworthiness, reliability and \ngood judgment. \n \nApplicant presented no evidence that he has received financial counseling of any \nkind, other than from a friendly realtor, who advised him to enter into a strategic default \non all of his debts relating to House 1. Such advice does not qualify under this mitigating \ncondition. There are no indications in the record that either of Applicant\u2019s two largest debts \nare being resolved. The fact that the former HELOC debt has been canceled by the \ncreditor is not evidence of successful mitigation efforts by Applicant. \n \nThe only debt that Applicant has paid is a small debt paid after the hearing in this \ncase. There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) \n \nApplicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He has not provided a \nreasonable basis to dispute this debt, which arose in 2012 when he stopped paying the \ndebt because, he claims, his debit card had expired. He has provided no documentation \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute. He merely claims that the debt no longer appears \non his credit report, which he failed to introduce into the record. Even if the debt dropped \noff his credit report, as it has in GE 3 and GE 4, that is not evidence of actions taken to \nresolve the dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) has not been established. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nMy analysis of the Guideline F mitigating conditions addresses many of the above \nfactors. I have weighed the importance of Applicant\u2019s military service in the Air Force with \na top secret and SCI security clearances during Operation Desert Shield and his work \nsince 2013 as a defense contractor. I have also considered the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s \n\n8 \n \nsituation dealing with his daughter\u2019s illness, but I conclude that his relocation for her care \ndid not significantly contribute to his debts or his mishandling of his debts.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Rice, Esq. \n \n11/05/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 15, \n2014. He submitted a second SCA on June 6, 2017. On March 15, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline E. The DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 12, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 29, 2019, \n\n \n2 \n \nand the case was assigned to me on June 21, 2019. On August 6, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for August 26, 2019. On August 22, 2019, Applicant retained an attorney, \nwho requested a continuance. I granted the continuance, and the hearing was \nrescheduled for September 25, 2019. I conducted the hearing as rescheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) I through V, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b and admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He \nworked part time as a customer service agent for a commercial airline from September \n2014 until he was hired for his current job in September 2018. (Tr. 15.) He was a full-\ntime federal employee at another government agency from June 2016 to May 2017, \nwhen he was terminated for unsatisfactory performance. (GX 1 at 13-14.) \n \n \nApplicant served in the Army National Guard (ARNG) from January 2000 to \nJanuary 2008. He served on active duty from January 2003 to January 2004. He \nreceived an honorable discharge in January 2008. He held a security clearance while in \nthe ARNG. \n \n \nApplicant was hired by a federal contractor as a security officer in April 2006. He \nwas fired in October 2009 for misuse of government equipment by using a government \ncomputer to search for a stripper to perform at a private party. The contractor\u2019s records \nreflect that he was fired \u201cper government request.\u201d At the hearing, he submitted a \ndocument from this contractor stating that he was eligible for rehire. (AX V.) \n \n \nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degree from a community college in May 2010 \nand a bachelor\u2019s degree from a university in May 2013. He married in December 2016 \nand has no children. \n \n \nApplicant submitted an SCA in February 2014. In response to a question \nwhether, in the last seven years, he had illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances, he disclosed that he had smoked marijuana three times between May 2004 \nand January 2014. (GX 2 at 35.) \n \n \nDuring a personal subject interview (PSI) in March 2014, Applicant was \nquestioned by a security investigator about his admitted use of marijuana. He told the \ninvestigator that he used marijuana in 2002 and 2004, but he was unable to remember \nthe detailed circumstances of his use. He told the investigator that he remembered \nusing marijuana in January 2014 with a woman who asked him if he knew anyone who \n\n \n3 \n \nsold marijuana. He responded that he did, and they drove to the home of the seller, \nwhere he made the purchase. They went to Applicant\u2019s residence, where they smoked \nit. He told the investigator that he purchased and smoked the marijuana to impress the \nwoman, but that it had no effect on his behavior. (GX 4 at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted another SCA in June 2017. In response to the question \nwhether, in the last seven years, he had illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances, he answered \u201cNo.\u201d He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether, in the \nlast seven years, he had been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, cultivation, \ntrafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, handling, or sale of any drug or \ncontrolled substance. (GX 1 at 57-58.) His negative answer to the second question was \nnot alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nIn a second PSI on June 21, 2018, Applicant was confronted with his admissions \nof marijuana involvement during the March 2014 PSI. He denied making those \nadmissions. He then \u201cclarified\u201d that unless the substance was tested in a lab, he was \nnot sure it was actually marijuana. (GX 5 at 11.)  \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in February 2019, Applicant stated that the \nsummaries of the March 2014 and June 2018 interviews were not accurate. He \nexplained: \n \nTo clarify, these incidents which are being called \u201cdrug involvements.\u201d \nThere is no proof of such incidents or drugs. There are no police reports, \nor criminal charges or no drug test results or anything of such, just my \nwords. . . .  \n \nTo clarify, at the time of each \u201cdrug involvement,\u201d I naively believed the \nsubstances of question were marijuana, and I tried to answer the \ninvestigator\u2019s questions from what I believed at that time. Whether I \nbelieved the substances to be marijuana at the time of each incident, a \nbelief does not make it factual. \n \nI know that the only way to confirm a substance is marijuana, is by lab \ntesting, and since the substances of questioning of all incidents I stated in \nthe previous 2014 report were never tested, so therefor I cannot, without a \ndoubt, state that the substances were marijuana. Therefore, this is the \nreason I stated no to the questions. \n \n(GX 3 at 6.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that his research on the effects of marijuana \nwas on \u201clegitimate websites, government websites.\u201d (Tr.17-18.) He submitted a treatise \nfrom the National Institute on Drug Abuse, published in June 2018 (no specific date in \nJune 2018 indicated), a fact sheet from the Drug Enforcement Administration on which \n\n \n4 \n \nthe publication date is illegible, and a January 2005 article from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation on the methods of drug analysis and identification. (AX I and II.)  \n \n \nOn cross-examination, Applicant testified that he did not recall when he \nconducted his research or what caused him to conduct it, but it was before he submitted \nhis 2017 SCA. He testified that in the second PSI he told the investigator that he was \nnot sure the substance was marijuana unless it was tested in a lab. He testified that he \ndid not mention his research because the investigator did not ask him about it. (Tr. 40.) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he submitted 21 letters from friends, \nassociates, former teachers, a deputy sheriff, and coworkers attesting to his good \ncharacter. At the hearing, he resubmitted several of the same letters. In addition, he \nsubmitted letters from three university professors, an ARNG recruiter, several \nsupervisors of community activities in which Applicant participates, and his current \nsupervisor. The letters attest to his good character, reliability, honesty, and \ntrustworthiness. (AX II.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n \n5 \n \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his June 2017 SCA by deliberately \nfailing to disclose that he used marijuana from 2002 to 2014 and answering \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances?\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The SOR does not allege Applicant\u2019s negative answer to \nthe second question in the SCA about involvement in \u201cthe illegal purchase, \nmanufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, shipping, receiving, handling, or sale of \nany drug or controlled substance.\u201d  \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified material facts during the June 2018 \nPSI when he denied use of marijuana from 2002 to about 2014 and deliberately sought \nto conceal his use of marijuana from 2002 to 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Finally, it alleges that \nApplicant was terminated from employment by a federal contractor in October 2009 for \nusing a government computer to search websites for a stripper for hire. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n6 \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: . . . (b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable:  \n \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of significant \nmisuse of Government or other employer's time or resources; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \n\n \n7 \n \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nI have noted that Applicant\u2019s negative answer to the second question in Section \n23 was not alleged in the SOR. However, it may be considered in determining whether \nhis negative answer to the first question was an intentional falsification. See ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Furthermore, in considering the adequacy \nof an SOR, it is important to note that an SOR is an administrative pleading, and such \npleadings are not held to the stringent standards of criminal indictments. As explained \nby the Appeal Board: \n[A]dministrative pleadings are not an end in themselves, but rather a \nmeans to assist the disposition of a case on its merits rather than pleading \nniceties. Accordingly, as long as there is fair notice to the affected party \nand the affected party has a reasonable opportunity to respond, a case \nshould be adjudicated on the merits of relevant issues and should not be \nconcerned with pleading niceties.  \nISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001). (Footnotes omitted.) In this \ncase, Applicant knew that his drug involvement in 2014 was at issue and that his \ndisclosures in his 2014 SCA were detrimental.  \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his June 2017 SCA, he knew that his answers to the \ndrug-related questions in his 2014 SCA were problematic and that the same answers in \nthe June 2017 SCA would likely result in denial of his application for a clearance. After \nthinking about his answers and conducting research, he answered all the drug-related \nquestions in the negative when he submitted his 2017 SCA. He carefully crafted his \nanswers in his 2017 SCA and the June 2018 PSI in an effort to overcome his \ndisclosures in 2014. His testimony at the hearing was vague and uncertain about the \ntiming of his research and the materials he reviewed. At least one of the documents he \nsubmitted at the hearing was a June 2018 publication. In any event, his rationale for \nanswering all the drug-related questions in the negative is flawed, for several reasons. \n \n \nFirst, the policy set out in AG \u00b6 15(b) makes it clear that \u201cfull, frank, and truthful\u201d \nanswers are required during the adjudicative process. This policy was amplified by the \nAppeal Board in ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002):  \n \nA security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The government has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. That \ncompelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in being \nable to make sound decisions, based on complete and accurate \ninformation, about who will be granted access to classified information. An \n\n \n8 \n \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to \nthe government in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \n \n \nSecond, the security-clearance process is not a drug-enforcement tool. It is an \nevaluation of an Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, good judgment, and willingness \nto follow rules and regulations. The focus of the drug-related questions in the SCA is not \non the nature of the substance involved, but on the willingness of an applicant to follow \nrules and regulations. Even if Applicant and his friend were swindled in 2014, he \ndemonstrated and admitted his willingness to violate the rules regarding illegal drug \ninvolvement.  \n \n \nThird, even Applicant and his friend were swindled in the 2014 transaction, \nApplicant\u2019s conduct fits squarely in the illegal drug activity covered by the second \nquestion in Section 23 of the SCA. Although the SOR alleged only the first question in \nSection 23, that section includes a second question pertaining to illegal purchase, \ntrafficking, receiving, handling, and sale of illegal drugs. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this \nsecond question. Applicant was asked by his friend to purchase marijuana, knowingly \nsought out a drug dealer, negotiated a purchase, received the product, and used it. In \nshort, he knowingly involved himself in illegal drug trafficking with a known drug dealer. \nHis demonstrated willingness to engage in illegal drug activity is sufficient to raise a \nsecurity concern. He did not raise any question about the nature of the product that he \npurchased until his first attempt at obtaining a security clearance failed. Even under the \nmore rigid guidelines of criminal law, he would be guilty of attempted purpose, \npossession, and use of marijuana. His attempt to recant his admissions in his 2014 SCA \nand the follow-up PSI is not credible. \n \n \nI am satisfied that Applicant knew that his answers to the questions in Section 23 \nof the June 2017 SCA and his responses to the investigator\u2019s questions during the June \n2018 PSI were deceptive and evasive. I conclude that the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) are established. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s termination of \nemployment for misuse of a government computer, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, is sufficient to \nraise AG \u00b6 16(d). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct his false \nstatements in the 2017 SCA and 2018 PSI. To the contrary, he persisted at the hearing \nin his efforts to recant his earlier admissions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for Applicant\u2019s falsifications. They were recent and \nmultiple. They were not minor, because a falsification of a security clearance application \n\u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2011.)  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for Applicant\u2019s termination of employment in October \n2009. It occurred long ago, has not recurred, and was regarded as minor by his \nemployer, who has indicated that he is eligible for rehire. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant is a well-educated, mature, and \nexperienced adult. His careful parsing of his answers in his 2017 SCA and the follow-up \nquestions during the June PSI are inconsistent with the requirement for full, frank, \ncandid, and truthful answers to questions during the investigative and adjudicative \nprocess. His attempt to apply criminal-law standards to an administrative adjudication is \nmisplaced and inconsistent with the adjudicative guidelines. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his personal conduct. \n \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his \nproblematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(e-QIP format) on November 29, 2016. This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. On February 6, 2019, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), \nexplaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for \n                                                          \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \n\n2 \n \nthe action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 7, 2019, and requested a decision based on the \nwritten record without a hearing.   \n \nOn April 15, 2019, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  \n(FORM). The FORM was mailed to Applicant on April 16, 2019. He was given thirty days \nto file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. Applicant received the FORM on April 30, 2019. Applicant did not respond to \nthe FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 9, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \n Included in the FORM were seven items of evidence. Items 1 through 7 are \nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. GE 1 through 6 are admitted into \nevidence without objection. GE 7 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing \nApplicant\u2019s interviews that took place in April, May, and October 2018 during the \nbackground investigation. The ROI is not authenticated, as required under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of \nthe Directive. Department Counsel\u2019s written brief includes a prominent paragraph \nadvising Applicant that the summary was not authenticated and that failure to object may \nconstitute a waiver of the authentication requirement. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded \nthat a pro se applicant\u2019s failure to respond to the FORM, which response is optional, \nequates to a knowing and voluntary waiver of the authentication requirement. The record \ndoes not demonstrate that Applicant understood the concepts of authentication, waiver, \nand admissibility. It also does not demonstrate that he understood the implications of \nwaiving an objection to the admissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, Exhibit 6 is inadmissible, \nand I have not considered the information in the ROI. See generally ISCR Case No. 12-\n10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra\u2019anan notes the \nhistorical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to \npresent a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. \nJudge Ra\u2019anan raises a number of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated \nROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 53 years old, married with two adult children. He is a high school \ngraduate who received training certificates from two state community colleges. Applicant \nserved in the U.S. Army Reserve from February 1984 until April 1992, when he was \nhonorably discharged. He has worked for a defense contractor since May 2016. (GE 3.) \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling more than \n$24,000. Applicant admitted these delinquent debts, claiming that he was laid off and \nused credit cards and other accounts to try to recover financially. He stated that he intends \nto address his delinquencies and avoid bankruptcy. (GE 2.)  \n                                                          \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. \n \n\n3 \n \nThe record shows that Applicant worked full-time from December 2005 until \nDecember 2010 when he was laid off due to his employer\u2019s downsizing. After he was laid \noff, Applicant worked part-time as self-employed until the present. In February 2013, he \nfound additional part-time employment until February 2015. In February 2015, he found \nfull-time employment which lasted until his employer downsized in January 2016, costing \nApplicant his job. Applicant was unemployed from January 2016 until May 2016. (GE 3, \npp. 11-20.) Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies continue to this day. (GE 4-6.)   \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance. \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, \n994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance). As noted by the Supreme Court in  \nEgan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 U.S. at 531. Under Egan, Executive \nOrder 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security. \nDirective, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level. \nDirective, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The \nGovernment has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR \nthat have been controverted. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. An applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven. Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. In addition, an applicant has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. Directive, \nEnclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is \nless than a preponderance of evidence. 484 U.S. at 531. The Appeal Board has followed \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-\nevidence standard. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n  \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations  \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness, financial problems, or difficulties. AG \u00b6 18 states the overall concern: \n \n\n4 \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting \nforth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It \nencompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other important \nqualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nFacts admitted by an applicant in an answer to a SOR require no further proof by \nthe Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions \n[applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of \nproof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an Administrative \nJudge\u2019s findings\u201d). Applicant has admitted the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. The \nevidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic financial history, as \nalleged. This raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). The next inquiry is \nwhether any potentially mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies persist to this day and remain substantial. On this \nrecord, I cannot find that AG \u00b6 20(a) applies.  \n Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to being laid off and using credit cards \nand other accounts to (unsuccessfully) keep current on his debts. Applicant did suffer \nfrom two downsizings and periods of underemployment and unemployment. Therefore, I \n\n5 \n \nfind that the circumstances that caused Applicant\u2019s financial problems were largely \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control. AG \u00b6 20(b) potentially applies, subject to an examination of \nevidence that he has acted responsibly in light of the adverse circumstances he has \nfaced.  \n Applicant, however, submitted no evidence bearing on how he has been \naddressing his delinquent debts. He has submitted no evidence that he is reliably taking \nsteps to address those debts. Applicant has only proffered in his Answer that he intends \nto honor those delinquent debts. Beyond that, the record is barren of evidence that \nwould support a finding that AG \u00b6 20(b) fully applies.  DOHA's Appeal Board has long \nago stated that promises to pay one's debts in the future are not a substitute for a clear \nrecord of debts actually paid. ICR Case No. 98-0188 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 29, 1999). In \ndetermining an individual's security worthiness, the Government cannot rely solely on \nan Applicant's promises that substantial debts will be resolved at a future date. \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial condition raises doubts about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching \nthis conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable \nevidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due \nconsideration to the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6).  \n \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n   Against Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n:                   Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information. \n \n \n  \nPhilip J.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn April 30, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DoD \nadjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security \nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 3, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on July 5, 2019, and interposed no objections to the materials in the \nFORM. She timely supplemented the record with written explanations of her debts and \nattached documents supporting her satisfaction of her late filing of her federal tax returns \nfor tax years 2014 and 2017, and state tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2017. She also \nprovided documentation of payments of her delinquent taxes owed the IRS and payostate \ntaxing authority, and Department of Education (DoE), as well as her successful dispute of \nthe debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant\u2019s post-FORM submissions were admitted \nwithout objection as Item 8. The case was assigned to me on August  23, 2019. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to file her federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 through 2017; (b) failed to file her state income taxes for tax \nyears 2013 through 2017: (c) is indebted to her state of residence for delinquent taxes in \nthe amount of $32,000; (d) is indebted to the DoE for student loan debts placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $34,634; and (e) is indebted to a consumer \ncreditor for an account charged off in the approximate amount of $231. (Item 1) Allegedly, \nher federal and state tax filing lapses and delinquent state tax, student loan, and \nconsumer debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations with explanations. \nShe claimed she shifted to part-time work in 2014 due to her mother\u2019s battle with \npancreatic cancer. She further claimed that she returned to full-time employment in \nDecember 2014 following her mother\u2019s passing in August 2014. She claimed that on the \nsame day upon her return to work, she was injured in an elevator accident and suffered a \nconcussion, bulging and ruptured discs in her cervical spine, a wrist tear, bilateral rotator \ncuff tears, and a meniscus tear in her left knee. She claimed that her injuries prompted \nher to seek workman\u2019s compensation (referred to as worker\u2019s compensation in her state) \nrelief that resulted in a settlement that did not begin until April 2015. Applicant claimed \nshe returned to work in February 2018 and was laid off in February 2019, along with 52 \nother colleagues. \nApplicant further claimed in her response that all of her unfiled federal and state \ntax returns were filed in May 2019, and she will make arrangements with both taxing \nauthorities to pay off her tax delinquencies. She claimed she allowed a garnishment from \nthe DoE to ensure her payments on her delinquent student loan debts would be properly \ncredited. And, she claimed that upon resolution of her worker\u2019s compensation case in \nApril 2017, she reached out to the SOR \u00b6 1.e creditor to pay it off but was told by the \ncreditor\u2019s collection agent that he could not locate the debt. Because she was unable to \npay off the debt, she disputed the debt and had it removed from her credit report. \nFinding   s    of Fact \nApplicant is a 49-year old software test engineer for a defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance.

(Items 6-7) Her credit reports also list a delinquent \nconsumer debt of $231 with SOR creditor \u00b6 1.e that Applicant disputes. \nApplicant attributes most of her financial struggles to extenuating circumstances \nassociated with periods of unemployment and underemployment in 2014 while caring for \nher terminally ill mother, and recovering from a serious work-related elevator accident. \n(Items 2 and 8) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant documented that once she settled her worker\u2019s compensation case, she \nfiled her delinquent federal and state tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2017. However, \nshe has not provided any documented evidence of filing her (a) federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2012-2013 and 2015-2016 and (b) state tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015-\n2016. (Items 2 and 8) Her claims that she did not earn enough income in 2012 and 2013, \nand from her self-employment and worker\u2019s compensation in 2015-2016 to require her \nfiling federal and state income tax returns for those years are neither substantiated  nor \ncorroborated.  \nCourt records confirm that in July 2019 Applicant satisfied and secured the \nreleases of state lien judgments entered in May 2008 for $9,177; in March 2011 for \n$1,440; in November 2011 for $12,778; in December 2013 for $5,583; in September 2016 \nfor $1,965; and in September 2017 for $18,432. (Item 8) Compliance with the monthly \npayment terms of her payment agreement is documented by payment receipts in July \n2019 totaling $60,277. (Items 7-8) \nFederal taxes owed by Applicant for tax years are also documented by the \nfollowing: a July 2019 receipt of a $1,050 check payment covering federal taxes owed for \ntax year 2017 and a July 2019 receipt of a $24,360 check payment covering federal taxes \nowed for tax year 2014. (Item 8) Whether Applicant owes back federal taxes for tax years \n2012-2013 and 2015-2016 is unclear. \nApplicant documented, too, her paying off her student loan arrears with DoE with a \nlump sum payment of $27,146 in July 2019. (Item 8) And, after resolving her worker\u2019s \ncompensation case in April 2017, she reached out to SOR creditor 1.e to resolve this \ndebt. When the creditor could not locate the account after several attempts, she disputed \nthe claim with the three major credit reporting agencies. (Items 2 and 8) As a result of her \nfiled disputes, SOR creditor 1.e agreed to remove the debt from the reporting agencies\u2019 \ncredit files. (Items 2, 8, and 11) \nPolicies \nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the \ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into \naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, \nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and \nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place \nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the context \nof the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG \n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is \nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent in this case: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the \njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain \na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances \nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over (a) Applicant\u2019s admitted failures to file federal \ntax returns for tax years 2012-2017, as required by federal law, and failures to file state \ntax returns for tax years 2013-2017, as required by state law; (b) accrual of over \n$32,000 in delinquent state taxes; (c) accumulation of a delinquent student loan debt \nwith the DoE in the amount of $34,634, and (d) a small consumer debt in the amount of \n$231. Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties warrant the application of three of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax-filing lapses and delinquent debt negate the need for \nany independent proof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 \n262 (6th ed. 2006). Each of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts is fully documented and creates \nsome judgment issues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security \nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing failures \nand debt delinquencies.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax filing issues and debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. \n14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s longstanding emphasis on timely tax filing and making timely \ntax payments to satisfy security concerns is both instructive and binding on \nadministrative judges. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) \n(reversing favorable grant of a security clearance, and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his \nsecurity clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has \nrehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and \nregulation expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d). \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s cited circumstances (caring for her mother and being \nvictimized by a serious elevator accident that resulted in workers\u2019 compensation claims \nand ensuing payments) contributed heavily to her financial setbacks associated with her \nperiods of unemployment and ensuing inability to pay her taxes and other bills. To her \ncredit, she has made concerted efforts to address her owed federal and state income \ntaxes for the years in issue, and pay off her delinquent DoD student loan. In recognition \nof her repayment efforts, she may take partial advantage of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual \ninitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.\u201d \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s successful disputing of the consumer debt covered by SOR \u00b6 \n1.e is mitigating and enables her to apply MC \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d This debt, accordingly, is favorably resolved \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of timely tax filing and debt \nreduction through voluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely \nresolution of delinquent debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, she failed to file her federal and state tax returns and pay off the \ntaxes owing for the years in issue until after the investigation process had initiated and \nan SOR was issued. And, the federal and state tax returns she did document filings for \nin May 2019  cover only two of the delinquent years in issue (2014 and 2017). \nBased on a thorough consideration of all of the evidence presented, Applicant is \nimputed to have been aware of her legal requirements to timely file her federal and state \ntax returns and pay the taxes owing for those years. With the evidence she established \nwith her answer and with her response to the FORM, she did not persuasively \ndemonstrate her inability to timely file her tax returns and pay the taxes due for the tax \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                         \n     \nyears in issue. While she may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance \nof these requirements at the time, her failure to take more timely steps to file or seek \nprofessional advice where she was unsure of her federal and state filing requirements \nprecludes her from mitigating security concerns associated with the Government\u2019s tax-\nfiling and payment concerns. \nWhole-Person Assessment \nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. While she has shown \nrenewed commitments to addressing and resolving her debts, her progress to date in \nresolving the Government\u2019s security concerns over her handling of her finances reflect \ninsufficient progress to date in addressing her federal and state tax filing and payment \nresponsibilities to merit enough positive credit to mitigate financial concerns. \nAlthough, Applicant appears to have satisfied the terms and conditions of her \ninstallment agreement with her state taxing authority and successfully resolved her \nstudent loan deficiency, fulfillment of her payment terms with her state of residence and \nDoE, respectively, were not completed until after the issuance of the SOR. Under these \ncircumstances, only the resolution of her student loan deficiency and successful dispute \nof her listed consumer debt can be mitigated. \nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s (a) late and incomplete filings of her back federal \nand state income tax returns and satisfaction of her state income taxes owed for the \nyears in issue, (b) discharging her DoD student loan delinquency, and (c) successfully \ndisputing her listed consumer debt, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing her federal \nand state filling of her tax returns and owed debts for the years in issue reflect \ninsufficient evidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to overcome \nreasonable doubts about her trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. See AG \u00b6 18. Overall, while Applicant\u2019s actions to date are encouraging, \nthey are enough to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. \nConclusions are warranted that Applicant\u2019s finances are insufficiently stabilized at \nthis time to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. \nEligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and circumstances of this case is \ninconsistent with the national interest. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n  Subparagraph 1.a-1.c:\n   Against Applicant\n  Subparagraphs 1.d 1.e:\n  For Applicant \n8 \n\n                                                                       Conclusions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n                                        \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \nhold a security clearance.

SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges \nhe has a debt placed for collection for $812. On November 27, 2017, Applicant agreed to \npay a debt-resolution company (DRC) $253 monthly to resolve four debts, including the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (AE C) He said the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is included in the DRC \npayment plan; however, the names of the creditors listed in the DRC plan do not match \nthe debtor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b.

(Tr. 42-43) None were provided.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; \nand \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant was defrauded and lost his investment. His withdrawal of funds from his \n401(k) plan to invest, and the loss of that investment resulted in substantial additional \ntaxes owed to the IRS that he did not or could not pay. This was a circumstance beyond \nhis control that adversely affected his finances. However, he did not prove he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, because he did not show he was unable to make \nmore progress paying his delinquent debts. There are not clear indications his financial \nproblems are under control. He did not provide proof that he diligently attempted to \nestablish payment plans to address his taxes and two other nontax delinquent debts. He \ndid not establish a track record of payment of his delinquent debts.  \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June \n15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct \nand employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of \naccess to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of \nthe SOR).   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies in part because he filed his tax returns and paid some of his \nrequired taxes; however, the timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect \nof the analysis. In ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal \nBoard reversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and \nnoted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for $8,504. A \u201ccharged-off \ndebt\u201d is an accounting entry. A creditor considers a debt owed to the creditor to be an \nasset. When the value of the asset is in doubt, the creditor is required to change the status \nof the debt to reflect its current status. When the debt appears to be uncollectible, the \ncreditor should change the status for accounting purposes from being an asset to charged \noff. Notwithstanding the change to charged-off status, a creditor may still sell the debt to \na collection agent, and the debtor may still pay or settle the debt. Eventually, the charged-\noff debts will be dropped from the debtor\u2019s credit report. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped \noff his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-\n05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial \nitems from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt \nbecoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. \nTitle 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit \nReporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-\nfair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute \nwhen creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nto a credit reporting company\u2019s request for information, or when the debt has been \ncharged off. \u201cMere evidence that debts no longer appear on credit reports is no reason to \nbelieve that they are not legitimate or that they have been satisfactorily resolved.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 16-02941 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2015)).  \n \nIn sum, Applicant owes about $26,000 to the IRS for tax years 2009 through 2012. \nApplicant does not have an established payment plan with the IRS. The SOR also alleges \ntwo delinquent non-tax debts. He did not establish with corroborating documentation that \nhe was making payments to DRC to resolve his delinquent non-tax SOR debts. He did \nnot establish he was unable to make greater progress resolving his delinquent SOR \ndebts, including his delinquent taxes. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior engineer level one who has worked in a part-time \ncapacity for the current defense contractor since 2016. In 1984, he received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in industrial electronics technology. He previously worked for a major \naircraft manufacturer for 31 years, retiring in 2015.  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and \npaid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The \nAppeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-\ntax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe primary problem here relates to Applicant\u2019s handling of his federal income \ntaxes. Applicant knew that he needed to establish a payment plan to address his \ndelinquent taxes, and his federal income tax debt is not in an established payment plan. \nAn established payment plan requires a track record of payments, and he has not made \nany payments for two years. He had a legal requirement to timely pay his taxes. He may \nnot have fully understood or appreciated the importance of these requirements. He \nprocrastinated. His actions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to \nfully mitigate security concerns. \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s tax issues, he owes two non-tax SOR debts that are past \ndue. He said he is working with DRC to resolve the debts; however, he did not provide \ncorroborating documentation showing his payments. He did not establish he was unable \nto make greater documented progress resolving his delinquent SOR debts, including his \ndelinquent taxes. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about [his] reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

China aggressively \nseeks classified and protected information from the United States. Foreign influence \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 18, 2016, Applicant signed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Government Exhibit (GE) 1. \nOn January 7, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to him, alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline B (foreign influence). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1990), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) 2) \n \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nOn February 1, 2019, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3) On February 28, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed. On March 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On April 5, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for April 25, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled using \nvideo teleconference.   \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered two exhibits; Applicant offered \nfour exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 15-18; GE 1-2; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-D) On April 29, 2019, Applicant \nprovided 12 exhibits, which were admitted into evidence without objection. (AE E-AE P) \nOn May 3, 2019, the record closed. (Tr. 56) On May 5, 2019, DOHA received a copy of \nthe transcript of the hearing. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice (AN) of facts concerning \nChina. (Tr. 15-16; HE 4) The request listed supporting documents to show detail and \ncontext for those facts. Portions of Department Counsel\u2019s AN request are quoted \nwithout footnotes and quotation marks. AG \u00b6 6, Foreign Influence, provides, \n\u201cAssessment of foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d A risk assessment in this case necessitates \nadministrative notice of facts concerning China.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nThe SOR alleges: in \u00b6 1.a, that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of China; in \u00b6 1.b, \nthat Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of China and owns a company in \nChina; and in \u00b6 1.c, that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of China. \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, and he provided some clarifications, \nextenuating, and mitigating information. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n                                            \n1 To protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy, the facts in this decision do not specifically \ndescribe employment, names of witnesses, and names of other groups or locations. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant is a 38-year-old systems engineer employed by a major defense \ncontractor since December 2015. (Tr. 6-7) He was born, raised, and educated in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 25; GE 1) In 1999, he graduated from high school, and in 2003, he \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. (Tr. 6) In 2006, he earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. (Tr. 6) Defense contractors have \nsporadically employed him since 2006. (Tr. 25-28) He has not served in the military. (Tr. \n7) \n \nApplicant\u2019s 31-year-old spouse was born in China. (Tr. 31) She received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in China. (Tr. 31) In 2010, she came to the United States to attend a \nuniversity and obtain a master\u2019s degree in biology. (Tr. 32) She met Applicant in 2012, \nand they married in 2013. (Tr. 7, 33) In 2013, she applied for U.S. permanent residence, \nand in September 2018, she became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 33-34; SOR response) When \nshe became a U.S. citizen, she took the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United \nStates of America, which states: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod.2 \n \nShe lost her Chinese citizenship when she became a U.S. citizen.3 Applicant and his \nspouse do not have any children. (Tr. 7, 33) She works in management for a financial \ncompany. (Tr. 29-30) \n \n                                            \n2 The language of the current Oath of Allegiance is found in the Code of Federal Regulations \nSection 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act.

(Tr. 35) His \nfather-in-law is employed in a senior position for a Chinese Government-owned entity \nthat trades in agricultural commodities in China. (Tr. 19-20, 37-39, 55) He does not own \na company in China. (SOR response) \n \nApplicant has less than monthly frequency of contact with his parents-in-law; \nhowever, his spouse has almost daily contact with them. (Tr. 43-44) Applicant\u2019s Chinese \nlanguage skills are limited. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law intend to move to the \nUnited States. (Tr. 41-42) In January 2019, Applicant filed the initial application for them \nto immigrate to the United States (Form I-130). (Tr. 42; AE E; AE F) Applicant\u2019s \nspouse\u2019s grandmother lives in China, and she does not intend to move to the United \nStates. (Tr. 52, 56) \n \nFrom September 2012 to April 2019, Applicant and his spouse had in-person \ncontact with his parents-in-law ten times over those seven years. (Tr. 45) They had in-\nperson contact with his father-in-law 103 days (4.3 percent of the total days) and with \nhis mother-in-law 163 days (6.7 percent of the total days). (Tr. 20-24, 45-46; AE A) They \nmet in the United States, Canada, and China. (AE A) Applicant and his spouse went to \nChina in 2014, 2017, and 2019. (Tr. 20-24; AE A) Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are \ngenerally aware of Applicant\u2019s employment, and they know he is applying for a security \nclearance. (Tr. 46-47) \n \nApplicant pays federal income taxes, and he and his spouse are financially \nstable. (Tr. 24-25; AE B; AE C) He and his spouse\u2019s total annual income is about \n$210,000. (Tr. 25; AE G; AE H) His net worth is all invested in the United States, mostly \nin stocks, banks, and mutual funds, and totals approximately $300,000 to $400,000. (Tr. \n47-48; AE I-AE P) \n \nApplicant has numerous relatives who live in the United States, including his \nparents, one sibling, and numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins. (Tr. 54; GE 1)  \n \nChina \n \nChina is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is \nthe paramount authority. CCP members hold almost all top government and security \napparatus positions. Chinese leaders are focused on developing the capabilities they \ndeem necessary to deter or defeat adversary power projection and counter third-parties \nincluding the United States in conflicts. China\u2019s military modernization is producing \ncapabilities that have the potential to reduce core U.S. military technological \nadvantages.  \n \nThe National Counterintelligence Executive has identified China and Russia as \nthe most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information and technology. China\u2019s \nintelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to \nexploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider \naccess to steal secrets.  \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nAgents of the Chinese Government are the world\u2019s most active and persistent \nperpetrators of economic espionage. Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and \neconomic information continue and represent a persistent threat to U.S. economic \nsecurity. The nature of the cyber threat evolves with continuing technological advances \nin the global information environment. \n \nChina uses its intelligence services and employs other illicit approaches that \nviolate U.S. laws and export controls to obtain national security and export-restricted \ntechnologies, controlled equipment, and other materials unobtainable through legal \nmeans. Chinese agents have engaged in multiple criminal acts to obtain classified and \nsensitive information. Chinese agents have stolen sensitive military information and \nviolated federal export control laws by illegally exporting defense equipment to China. \nChina uses its cyber capabilities to support intelligence collection against the U.S. \ndiplomatic, economic, and defense industrial base sectors that support U.S. national \ndefense programs. The information targeted benefits China\u2019s defense and high-\ntechnology industries and provides insights into U.S. leadership views on China issues. \nAdditionally, targeted information informs Chinese military planners about U.S. defense \nnetworks, logistics, and related military capabilities. \n \nChina uses state-sponsored industrial and technical espionage to support military \nresearch, development, and acquisition. The organizational network of China\u2019s military-\nindustrial complex is such that the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is able to access \nsensitive and dual-use technologies or knowledgeable experts under the guise of \ncivilian research and development. \n \nIn assessing the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic \nrelationship between the U.S. and China, the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission has reported that the Chinese government has conducted large-\nscale cyber espionage against the United States. China has compromised a range of \nU.S. networks, including those of DOD, defense contractors, and private enterprises. \nChina\u2019s substantial and sustained investment in defense research and development \n(R&D) has helped China improve its military-industrial complex. China\u2019s state-\nsponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary information has allowed China to \nfill knowledge gaps in its domestic defense and commercial R&D. \n \nChinese Government repression and coercion against organizations and \nindividuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy, and public interest and ethnic \nminority issues occurs. Human rights concerns in China include: repression of speech, \nreligion, association, assembly, the press, and movement for certain minorities; \nextrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention; torture and \ncoerced confessions of prisoners; a lack of due process in judicial proceedings; \nsearches of premises without warrants; monitoring of communications (including \ntelephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet \ncommunications); and opening of domestic and international mail. Additionally, citizens \nlacked the right to change their government and had limited forms of redress against the \ngovernment.  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe U.S. Department of State warns visitors to China that they may be \ninterrogated or detained without information about their alleged crime. Some U.S. \ncitizens have been held in China based on an \u201cexit ban\u201d for years. Hotel rooms \n(including meeting rooms), offices, cars, taxis, telephones, Internet usage, and fax \nmachines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions in hotel \nrooms, including computers, may be searched without knowledge or consent.   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on \nany express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \nIt is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President \nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about foreign influence as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was born in China and educated there through the bachelor\u2019s \ndegree level. In 2010, she moved to the United States, and in September 2018, she \nwas naturalized as a U.S. citizen. Her parents are citizens and residents of China. She \nhas frequent4 contact with her parents. Her father is a senior official employed by a \nChinese-owned agricultural commodity company.          \n \nApplicant lives with and is close to his spouse. His spouse has relatives living in \nChina. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, their immediate family members. See generally ISCR Case No. 01-03120, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). \u201c[A]s a matter of common sense \nand human experience, there is [also] a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of \naffection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-17673 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002)). This concept is the basis of AG \u00b6 7(e). Indirect influence \nfrom a spouse\u2019s relatives living in China result in a security concern. See ISCR Case \nNo. 09-05812 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 2011) (finding \u201cpresence in India of close family \nmembers, viewed in light of that country\u2019s troubles with terrorism and its human rights \nabuses, and his sharing living quarters with a person (his spouse) having foreign family \ncontacts, establish the \u2018heightened risk\u2019\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b) and 7(e)).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s relationships with citizens and residents of China create a \nconcern about Applicant\u2019s \u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology\u201d and \nhis desire to help his spouse. For example, if intelligence officials, or other entities in \nChina, wanted to expose Applicant to coercion, they could exert pressure on his \nspouse\u2019s relatives living in China. Applicant would then be subject to coercion through \nhis connections to China and classified information could potentially be compromised. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s close family ties with her family living in China, are not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his spouse \nhas a close relationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this factor \nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result \nin the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United \nStates. The relationship of China with the United States, places a significant, but not an \n                                            \n4 See ISCR Case No. 09-03114 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010) (contact once a month is \nconsidered to be \u201cfrequent\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8). \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his spouse\u2019s \nrelationships with her family members living in China do not pose a security risk. \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist his spouse\u2019s relatives in \nChina. \n  \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from China seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, his spouse, or her \nrelatives living in China, nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in \nthe future. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s relationships with her family members living in China \ncreate a potential conflict of interest because these relationships are sufficiently close to \nraise a security concern about Applicant\u2019s desire to assist her relatives in China by \nproviding sensitive or classified information. Department Counsel produced substantial \nevidence of his spouse\u2019s relationships with her family living in China and has raised the \nissue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. Further inquiry is \nnecessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                              \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) have limited applicability. Applicant\u2019s spouse has frequent \ncontacts with her relatives living in China. There is no evidence that her contracts and \ncommunications are other than casual and family related; however, Applicant\u2019s in-laws \nin China are aware that Applicant is employed by a defense contractor and is seeking a \nsecurity clearance. Moreover, Applicant has visited China three times in the last five \nyears, and Chinese intelligence officials are likely to be aware of those visits. Loyalty to, \nsupport for, and connections to family are positive character traits. However, for security \nclearance purposes, those same relationships and Applicant\u2019s specialized education \nand background negate the possibility of full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c). \nApplicant failed to fully meet his burden of showing there is little likelihood that his \nrelationships with relatives in China could create a potential for risk of foreign influence \nor exploitation.   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant \nconnections to the United States. Applicant and his spouse are citizens and residents of \nthe United States. Applicant has numerous relatives who are citizens and residents of \nthe United States, including his parents, one sibling, and numerous aunts, uncles, and \ncousins. He and his spouse\u2019s total annual incomes are about $210,000, and they have \naccumulated substantial financial resources.  \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                              \nChina does not recognize dual citizenship, and Applicant\u2019s spouse is solely a \ncitizen of the United States. When Applicant\u2019s spouse took the U.S. oath of allegiance \nand when Applicant volunteered to assist the U.S. Government as a contractor, they \nmanifested their patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States over all other \ncountries. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents have expressed their intention to move to the \nUnited States, and Applicant has filed documents with the U.S. Government manifesting \nthat intention. Once they have actually moved to the United States, and her father has \nended his employment with a Chinese owned company, security concerns will be \nsubstantially reduced.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his spouse\u2019s relationships with family living in \nChina. There is no evidence, however, that terrorists, criminals, the Chinese \nGovernment, or those conducting espionage have approached or threatened Applicant, \nhis spouse, or their relatives living in China to coerce Applicant to provide classified or \nsensitive information.5 As such, there is a reduced possibility that Applicant, his spouse, \nor her relatives living in China would be specifically selected as targets for improper \ncoercion or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s relatives living in China could become \npotential targets because Applicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could \ntheoretically add some risk to them from intelligence elements in China. \n \nWhile the U.S. Government does not have any burden to prove the presence of \nsuch evidence, if such record evidence were present, Applicant would have a heavier \nevidentiary burden to mitigate foreign influence security concerns. It is important to be \nmindful of the United States\u2019 sizable financial and diplomatic connections to China.  \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(d), 8(e), and 8(f) do not apply. The U.S. Government has not \nencouraged Applicant\u2019s involvement with anyone living in China. Applicant is not \nrequired to report his contacts with citizens or residents of China. Applicant does not \nhave significant assets in China, and his assets in the United States do not mitigate \nsecurity concerns. \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s connections to her relatives living in China are close \nand raise a security concern. Her parents are citizens and residents of China. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has frequent contact with them. Applicant and his spouse had in-\nperson contact with them 10 times in the previous 7 years. Applicant and his spouse \ntraveled to China three times in the past five years. Applicant and his spouse have \nsignificant connections to the United States; however, they are not sufficient to \novercome his spouse\u2019s connections to China. Foreign influence security concerns are \nnot mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n                                            \n5 There would be little reason for U.S. enemies to seek classified information from an applicant \nbefore that applicant has access to such information or before they learn of such access.   \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline B are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old systems engineer employed by a major defense \ncontractor since December 2015. He was born, raised, and educated in the United \nStates. In 2006, he earned a master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. Defense \ncontractors have sporadically employed him since 2006. Applicant has numerous \nrelatives who are citizens and residents of the United States. He and his spouse have \nexcellent annual incomes that total about $210,000, and they have accumulated \nsubstantial financial resources. Applicant was a credible, intelligent witness that clearly \nwants to do what is best for national security. I have no doubt that he is completely loyal \nto the United States.  \n \nApplicant through his spouse has significant connections to China. His spouse \nwas born in China and educated through the bachelor\u2019s degree level in China. In 2010, \nshe moved from China to the United States, and she was naturalized as a U.S. citizen \nin 2018. Her parents are citizens and residents of China, and she has frequent contact \nwith her parents. Applicant and his spouse have visited China three times in the last five \nyears. Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law know he is a highly educated engineer with a security \nclearance. Chinese intelligence officials are likely to be aware of Applicant because of \nhis visits to China.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017) the Appeal Board \nconsidered a Guideline B case involving a U.S. citizen with family members in China \nand commented: \n \nIn Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved \nand the intelligence gathering history of that government are among the \nimportant considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the \ncase. The country\u2019s human rights record is another important \nconsideration. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                              \n2007); ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). There is a \nrational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose \ninterests are adverse to the United States and the risk that the applicant \nmight fail to protect and safeguard classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 10-07436 at 3, n. 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2011). \n \nWe note record evidence and the Judge\u2019s findings of the following: \nApplicant\u2019s parents reside in China; Applicant communicates with them \nfrequently; Applicant has visited them or they her on a regular basis; \nApplicant\u2019s parents are aware of the location and general nature of her \nwork; China practices espionage against the U.S.; and China has used its \ncyber-espionage capability to compromise DOD and contractor computer \nsystems. This evidence supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s \nparents could become a means through which Applicant could come to \nthe attention of Chinese intelligence personnel and be subjected to \ncoercion or pressure.  \n \nThere are some factual differences between Applicant\u2019s case, and ISCR Case \nNo. 15-00528 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017); however, the issues of security concern in that \ncase and Applicant\u2019s case are similar. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00042 (App. Bd. \nJuly 6, 2016) (denial of security clearance due to connections to China affirmed); ISCR \nCase No. 14-03200 (App. Bd. July 16, 2015) (same); ISCR Case No. 12-04780 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2013) (stating \u201cThe PRC\u2019s history of conducting espionage against \nthe United States puts a heavy burden of proof on Applicant that he was unable to meet \nbecause of his ties to his relatives who are PRC citizens and residents.\u201d). \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson. Foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. It is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                              \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",
